1
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:33,240
The next case is a case of myalgic encephalomyelitis.

2
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:54,570
We have here the analysis of the first follow up, in which case I will mention what took place.

3
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,490
-You didn't have any reactions from these remedies?

4
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,950
-I think I had reactions from Lycopodium. When I went to my first homeopath,

5
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,290
after three remedies she did not know what to give me and I read a book

6
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:31,280
and I saw my life there, in Lycopodium, so I passed it to her and she gave me Lycopodium.

7
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,870
I think I had many reactions from Lycopodium and I still think I'm in Lycopodium

8
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,970
from the beginning in 84.

9
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,230
-He gave you the clue.

10
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:59,110
So you got reaction from Lycopodium. All the other remedies?

11
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:04,170
-All the other remedies, I don't think I had any reaction.

12
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,430
Maybe a little bit from first remedy.

13
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,520
-Staphysagria?
-Not Staphysagria, Phosphoric acid.

14
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:19,280
Then after a few days I felt so bad I took some Valium and then it stopped.

15
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,020
-What is the main complain?

16
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,430
-The main complain is that the brain does not work anymore.

17
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:40,680
Over the years the brain has skipped all the problems and became at very little things.

18
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,590
At my first homeopath I went there because I had psoriasis and nothing else

19
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:58,090
and then after a few months I took various colds in head in 84 and also in 82

20
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:02,840
and then the brain... I began to see my nose.

21
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:21,590
I could see the nose all day and all things would do automatically like opening the door,

22
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:31,180
putting a key. I was always using the wrong key and then the memory began to weaken,

23
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,880
I began to forget names, things I was to do.

24
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,920
-In the meantime the psoriasis was improving?

25
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:54,920
-When I took first Lycopodium it got worse for three weeks, it was very much white

26
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:03,590
and very thick and it began to break and then after three weeks, the psoriasis went away.

27
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:10,160
I began to feel full of energy and to feel strong.

28
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:16,760
I've been school teacher until 78 and after that I couldn't do my job anymore, so I stopped.

29
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,510
I felt I was beginning a new life.

30
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,580
Then I began to study Homeopathy and studying Spanish.

31
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,180
But after a few months the brain didn't want to work.

32
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:44,090
The information wouldn't get in, it wouldn't get out anymore but I know

33
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:50,550
that everything I ever read is there in the brain but it doesn't want to come out.

34
00:04:52,260 --> 00:05:01,170
It was in July this year that I first thought that it was a problem of weakness

35
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:07,910
because then I had days and weeks that the brain felt exhausted.

36
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:15,520
It was so tired, just opening my eyes I was so tired, so exhausted feeling my head.

37
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:30,260
From that moment on also the muscular power began to weaken, the strength in my body.

38
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:38,870
I think that it began last year in September when it was always a slippy feeling here

39
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,420
in my arms and my head and my calves and my feet.

40
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:49,080
I needed to get a little obstruction to get that sleepy feeling

41
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:56,660
and at last it was not obstruction at all, my feet begin to prickle

42
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:07,010
and it was a crawling feeling in the calves and later on it was a nod in the muscle.

43
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,840
But I think it wasn't a nod because it always changed place

44
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:21,330
and the calves began to feel very flabby and I couldn't get to the stairs anymore.

45
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,830
I had pain in legs from tiredness, not from stiffness but from tiredness.

46
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,190
I had to sit down and wait.

47
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,180
-Before all this started did you have any virus infection?

48
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:51,930
-It was in 82 that I had a terrible cold in the head.

49
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,620
I was skiing in Austria and I was sweating and sweating, it was very hot there

50
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,600
and then we did snowboard on the North side of the hill, it was very cold

51
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:11,600
and I was waiting for the others and I felt the sweat in my body.

52
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,030
The wind was blowing through my clothes.

53
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:26,190
Then it was like needles straight right through the head and it hurt

54
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:36,270
and through the eye it was like needle and I don't remember if I took... I had very much coryza...

55
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:46,020
but after two months I was still hawking up and I went to the doctor and she gave me penicillin

56
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,360
but I took only 15 out of 20 tablets.

57
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,040
I thought I go to Greece, well everything will stop there.

58
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,440
-Before you go to Greece?

59
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:04,950
-In 82 I came to Greece for holidays and I thought the weather is beautiful to Greece,

60
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:12,520
it will go away and then it was terrible, I could blow five handkerchiefs a day,

61
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,120
both ears were full with mucus.

62
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,520
-What did you do here?
-I was sailing in Corfu.

63
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,520
-Did you take anything?
-I took penicillin again from a Greek doctor.

64
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,510
-For how long?

65
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:41,920
-All the 20 days and then the coryza went away and the heavy feeling went away.

66
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:56,900
Then I went to a make a massage by the end of the year because I had a problem with a leg.

67
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:07,630
I couldn't walk for 200 mt and I still can't and it worked so perfectly that in 83 I felt wonderful.

68
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:19,570
I felt stronger, I felt better than I had felt since I had left my school.

69
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:31,710
In 84 again in February I took a new cold in the head and the same happened in 85 and in 86.

70
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,670
Every time in February...

71
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:53,400
-When the weakness started?
-I think the sleepy feeling started in September 85.

72
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:04,630
I was skating at the end of 85 and I could let my body do any kind of sport I like

73
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,550
because I'm technically very good and I technically skate very good

74
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:17,150
but I couldn't get with the others and then I wondered if I was getting weak.

75
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:25,810
But I first knew it in June or July this year when I felt so exhausted from the legs,

76
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,910
just by riding on a bike.

77
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:38,560
I could go to a certain speed and just a little bit of that speed, two steps

78
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,650
and then exhausted in the legs.

79
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,380
-Do you feel your muscles are becoming wasting?

80
00:10:51,480 --> 00:11:00,060
-They are very soft as if there were no muscles there anymore in the calves

81
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,420
but it improved last month again.

82
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,740
I just wanted to ask a question.

83
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:21,090
Let us say you are in a regular School for Homeopathy and you are given a case like that.

84
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,570
How much time you will require to have to study the case?

85
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:45,400
If you are left yourself to study this case and tell me the remedies you have come,

86
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,750
can anybody tell me how much time you will need?

87
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:56,600
This is a difficult case, it is not a usual remedy, as you understand.

88
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,740
How much time it will be sufficient for you to study.

89
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:12,510
-Initially it will take two hours and sometimes you may need more time.

90
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:20,500
-Between 2-3 hours including the case
-No after.

91
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,680
-After the case to come to a conclusion.

92
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,420
I should have let you to work more.

93
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:52,080
-How long after the psoriasis went away this muscular illness began?

94
00:12:52,180 --> 00:13:06,580
-The muscular illness started after a cold and then it was relieved and by the second cold,

95
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:14,410
a strong cold then he remained in that state. His organism seemed to react in the first cold

96
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:19,500
and come up and then in the second cold he stayed in that state.

97
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:27,490
Now during that time while he was having this condition, he took Lycopodium.

98
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:28,830
-And the psoriasis went away?

99
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:35,830
-The psoriasis went away and he felt very good, that was 2-3 months and then he relapsed.

100
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,670
And after that did you hear the remedies so far he had taken?

101
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,500
-No.

102
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,750
-He has taken quite a lot of remedies.

103
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:59,400
-Do you understand the suppression of the eruption has anything to do with this illness

104
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,660
at this point? Are you thinking that?

105
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:09,820
-No, I'm thinking that the immune system is dropped considerably.

106
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:19,320
This for me is what we call a myalgic benign encephalomyelitis.

107
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:25,310
It is this new kind of disease which circulates the last 10-15 years.

108
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:31,150
Its' a syndrome which imitates a lot of different diseases, it comes usually

109
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:56,990
after a viral infection and it is very stubborn disease that you must not be impatient with.

110
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,170
Don't be impatient with that disease.

111
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:12,910
Also these people are very sensitive because their immune system is very weak.

112
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,650
What he describes it's very interesting as a description of the remedy

113
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,900
because we don't have it in our Materia Medica.

114
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,390
Nothing will come into the brain, nothing will go out of the brain.

115
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:31,890
This is a subjective feeling but it's very clear. It is as if there is a blockage,

116
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:40,000
as if the brain does not perceive and does not send out signals.

117
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:49,310
Is this for instance a case of Helleborus?
-No.

118
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,160
-I never say the remedy from the beginning.

119
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,170
Sometimes I will do it and you will have a surprise.

120
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,070
Yet you cannot have a clue about the remedy, that's why I let the case develop

121
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,830
because it is not possible you can have a clue of the remedy so far.

122
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:19,060
What is it? It is new, the Materia Medica does not describe it anywhere.

123
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,910
It is a new situation, we do not know it.

124
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,650
-There is something I didn't understand. What did he say about the nose?

125
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:35,900
-He could see his nose. Usually we don't see our nose, especially if one has a small nose

126
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,400
but even if you have a big one, you don't see it.

127
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,740
Now he does not have a big one and still he sees his nose.

128
00:16:53,250 --> 00:17:02,900
-But it improved last month again, I took Baryta carbonica and then the sleepy feeling went away,

129
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:11,080
the crawling is still there but then they are a bit stronger after Baryta carbo.

130
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,730
You see when the remedy is close, it's going to act, its' going to produce something

131
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:23,500
but still leaves the patient sick, it does not bring about a cure.

132
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,250
It's a Baryta carbonica yes. It's one of the possibilities.

133
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:39,240
-Can you walk upstairs now?
-Yes I can walk upstairs now.

134
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,810
-You can run?

135
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:54,580
-I didn't do very much running or many physical things lately.

136
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:05,320
-Did you take Gelsemium?
-No, never.

137
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,490
Gelsemium is also another possibility that one may think in this case

138
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:19,390
because you have the heaviness, the exhaustion, the legs are very weak, he can't climb upstairs,

139
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,240
he can not run.

140
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:31,490
It's a remedy that must be indicated very much, in the books they say after flu symptoms.

141
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:38,170
Most probably they have seen the syndrome before and Gelsemium

142
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:43,240
was one of the remedies that has counteracted this syndrome.

143
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:04,890
-I'm a little bit thinking of Lycopodium because when I first went to homeopath,

144
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:14,640
I just had a little bit of psoriasis and the thing that I liked or didn't like with Lycopodium

145
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,740
but I recognized in Lycopodium is how you feel about women.

146
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:34,730
You see women how to go to bed with and I think there is one fear in me

147
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:40,310
that you described there because I never went to bed with any woman.

148
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,810
-Never?
-No, never.

149
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,310
-You didn't have sex intercourse?

150
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:51,810
-Just a few times when I was 20-24, one time when I was 27

151
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,340
and then for 10 years no intercourse at all.

152
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,430
I was just afraid that a woman might I like you, let's go to bed.

153
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:11,160
I was afraid that it wouldn't be any erection, I would fail in that.

154
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:21,650
That's what I recognized in Lycopodium, wanting but erection failing.

155
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:28,140
It is now for a few months that I go steady with a girl and I can sleep with her

156
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,890
and sometimes I have an erection and sometimes I haven't but I always have the feeling that

157
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:46,810
there isn't enough erection power there and also what you described the wanting for company

158
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:51,140
and not wanting company and company in the other room.

159
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,230
I stayed with my parents till I was 38 years old, I lived with my own parents;

160
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,570
I didn't dare to live on my own.

161
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:13,170
-Which symptom you consider to be the most serious?

162
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:25,750
-I'm thinking that my brain will let me down and I won't have any brain power left.

163
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,910
-Can you describe how you feel exactly?

164
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,240
Did you hear that?
-No.

165
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,250
-It says on the notes, when I get overheated my forehead goes cold.

166
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,140
And he says I'm afraid that I will be left without brain, not physical that it will evaporate

167
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,570
but that he will become senile.

168
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:31,660
-Conium has suppressed sexual feelings.

169
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,890
-No to my understanding, it cannot be.

170
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,990
What he explains about Lycopodium, he explains it the wrong way.

171
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:53,410
What I have said about Lycopodium is that he has a lot of different women,

172
00:22:53,510 --> 00:23:02,160
he gets the excitement of one night stand with a woman and then when he is married

173
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:11,300
to have a steady relationship, he cannot have a normal erection and desire.

174
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,240
He loses the desire and the erection and then he has to go for excitement

175
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:24,380
and then he tries to find excitement out of his marriage. It is not his case.

176
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:28,260
He has interpreted what I said.

177
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,890
The world becomes strange because the brain is not able to receive the information,

178
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:00,820
when this coldness comes.

179
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,960
I understand this is a constant state which is aggravated when he is getting heated.

180
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:31,090
-This feeling is also present when there is much wind or when it's very calm.

181
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:38,350
It's worse outside and when I get in the car to go home, it's better.

182
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,450
Sometimes the world gets strange.

183
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:57,100
-I think since I wrote that, maybe in June, first it was the brain knowing

184
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,630
that it couldn't take all this information, it shut me from the information off

185
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:04,090
so that I didn't recognize the world.

186
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:09,940
I lost my way in the car when I wanted to go home and I couldn't find my home

187
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:16,440
and now that hindering has gone all the information is coming in

188
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,790
and the brain is getting exhausted.

189
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,790
Now the world does not look strange anymore...

190
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:35,300
-The last remedy has improved?

191
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:49,280
-I took Baryta carbonica after the exhausted feeling, about one month ago.

192
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,020
-And you feel better after that?

193
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:04,020
-The muscular power a little bit is coming back but the brain is no good.

194
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:13,910
Three days ago there was no contact with the world, I was just living inside my brain.

195
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:22,600
Going over and over the problems that are in my brain, the fear, the worried...

196
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:45,170
-What other things you feel or this is all? You have said everything?

197
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,270
-No I don't think I have said everything.

198
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:55,670
I think for all my life there has been a lack of feeling, I never fall in love,

199
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:06,160
I don't feel friendship but that is one of the things I felt when I took Lycopodium

200
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,270
for the second time.

201
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:18,910
One night I was caressing my cat and I suddenly realized that I didn't want to lose again.

202
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:27,160
It only remained there for half an hour and when I saw a girlfriend I felt the warmth,

203
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,950
I was happy to see her and normally those things don't mean anything to me.

204
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:36,260
-You don't...

205
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:45,170
-It is as if I don't love very much and I don't hate very much.

206
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:55,080
I like a little and I dislike a little but there is never any strong feeling in me.

207
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,240
-Maybe it's good to tell about the girl.

208
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:11,500
-I was in love I was 16 years old and I think it's the only time

209
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,720
I fell very much in love with a girl.

210
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,650
She liked me especially in the beginning but we didn't have any intercourse.

211
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:25,810
We were very young, I didn't want it then.

212
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,160
She was going to bed with elderly men.

213
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:45,060
-She was going to bed with elderly men and you knew that?

214
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,820
-I knew that but I didn't want to lose her but after three years when I was 18,

215
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:57,650
she went to bed with my uncle and then I said this can't go on anymore

216
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,500
and it took me another 3 years to fell out of love.

217
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:07,240
And I always thought that, that might have killed all other feelings.

218
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,500
Before that time I don't remember very strong feelings.

219
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,340
You see how the case is prepared for what is coming eventually.

220
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:38,220
Can you imagine his psychology? He is too idealistic, too romantic, too pure

221
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:46,060
and he finds out eventually that the girl he is in love with, she goes with elder men

222
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,160
and he has the shock of seeing her in bed with his uncle.

223
00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:01,880
That prepares the ground for what is coming and when he gets the flu,

224
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:10,060
the organism is already depressed and he goes into that permanent state now.

225
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,830
Already his feelings are reduced.

226
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:23,580
His feelings were I believe 10% of the original feelings that he had after this affair.

227
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:41,570
-I had very strong feelings for my father or for my mother or brother, sister or relatives.

228
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:51,640
-Did you take Staphysagria, Nux moschata, Platina, Pulsatilla, Lycopodium, Nux vomica,

229
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,080
Sulphur and Baryta carbonica?
-Yes.

230
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:05,750
-Phosphoric acid?
-The first was Phosphoric acid and Rhus tox.

231
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,420
-Phosphoric acid did not act?

232
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:26,470
-It was too short after leaving school, so I had periods when I felt bad and I had to take Valium.

233
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:29,730
-When you say leave school?

234
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:39,830
-I was school teacher and after 15 years I felt so tired, I couldn't go to my job again.

235
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:49,910
-He doesn't have to work anymore.

236
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,930
-I can't work anymore, I'm paid by the government.

237
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:08,410
Not now but when I took Lycopodium I thought I could start a new life and fight again.

238
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,910
-Lycopodium was not repeated?

239
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:20,740
-Phosphoric acid was once repeated on my request after Pulsatilla.

240
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:30,480
She gave me Pulsatilla and after that I asked her to try Lycopodium again and it didn't work.

241
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,970
It went badly.

242
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:42,230
I took Lycopodium 1.000, I had to shake it 40 times, then I had mint and I was afraid

243
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:49,320
that the mint might have broken the action, so I shook it another 40 times and I took it again.

244
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:56,070
-So you had a big reaction?
-No, I just felt very bad.

245
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:02,220
I was riding on a bike and the whole world was strange.

246
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:16,670
I knew where I was but it was strange. Like you build your own house from paper.

247
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,380
-You thought the world was made out of paper?

248
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:29,240
-It just wasn't real. I saw it but it wasn't real.

249
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:46,480
-Do you have any constipation?
-No, more diarrhea.

250
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,230
I'm thinking of what remedy now?
-Alumina.

251
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,990
-I'm thinking of Alumina and that's why I said do you have any constipation.

252
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:04,300
Because that state you can see in Alumina, it is an extreme state that you see in Alumina.

253
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,670
Perhaps not so strong as he describes but very close.

254
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:23,060
-More diarrhoea. It changes through the last 2-3 years.

255
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:30,460
At the moment after I'm eating I must go to the toilet and in the morning it's normal

256
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,570
but in the evening often it's diarrhoea.

257
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,570
-Are you afraid of snakes?
-No, I'm not afraid of snakes.

258
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:55,970
-Do you feel that you don't have any contact with a woman because you feel intimidated by that

259
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:01,080
or you feel cowardice?

260
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:10,970
-I think that all my life people liked me very much, I'm gentle and I'm afraid that

261
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:18,490
when I talk to a woman she would say, let's go to a cinema and it will develop to go to bed

262
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,470
with each other and I'm afraid to go to bed.

263
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,460
-In case you fail?
-In case I fail.

264
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,460
-Not because you don't like her?

265
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,560
-Not because I don't like her. I'm always very fond to look at girls.

266
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:40,210
-What are you doing to let this desire out?

267
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:50,230
-I've masturbated from the age of 10-11 until now twice, three times a night.

268
00:35:51,480 --> 00:36:03,050
The last 2-3 months my homeopath said try to let that off and it is very much less than before.

269
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:10,220
-In your imagination when you masturbate, do you imagine an intercourse with a woman?

270
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:18,800
-With a woman, mostly young women that don't have any experience, I feel more comfortable.

271
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,810
It's only with women.

272
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:57,220
-You are brought up in a family of how many children?
-Three children.

273
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,940
-Did you have a good life in your family?

274
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,510
-I think I had a good life. My father left us very much but he was very dominating,

275
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:16,790
not that he hit us. I was only hit once in my whole life but he saw the world...

276
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:27,280
He thought that life must be led and he made us live like that.

277
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:38,030
Like eating at six o'clock is good, so we always ate at six o'clock, never one minute later.

278
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:44,860
Going to bed early is very good, so at ten o'clock going to bed, maybe birthday,

279
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:53,950
maybe New Year's Eve but always discipline at ten o'clock.

280
00:37:54,450 --> 00:38:01,110
I had friends, we stayed at the sea side and we were 16,17,18 years old

281
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:09,430
and we were lying and talking to each other, I was always the first, holidays or no holidays,

282
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:13,540
half past nine, I had to go to bed.

283
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,870
I think that was his insecurity that made him live like this.

284
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:27,520
-And all the other brothers and sisters did the same?

285
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:35,770
-I was the oldest. My brother was three and half years younger and he could go to bed

286
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,620
at ten o'clock.

287
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:46,290
I had to go to bed at ten o'clock when I was 17, he had to go when he was 14, 15 years old.

288
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,440
And he is very different character from me, he didn't mind very much.

289
00:38:53,540 --> 00:39:02,290
He was big and strong and he didn't do what he didn't do.

290
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,930
-When you masturbate do you have proper erection?

291
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:46,430
-Yes but not always. There are months that I don't have proper erection

292
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:49,430
and then for a few months suddenly the erection comes back,

293
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,690
so I can masturbate two times per night.

294
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,030
-Do you have orgasm?
-Yes.

295
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,020
-Which comes every time?

296
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,860
-Every time I have orgasm, that's orgasm I didn't go to bed with a girl.

297
00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:13,760
I'm staying with this girl now and I go to bed with her, there is orgasm.

298
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,100
There is orgasm but it's much less than when I masturbate.

299
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,450
When I masturbate it is very much better.

300
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:29,600
-You have a sexual intercourse?
-Yes.

301
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,340
-And you have an erection?
-Yes.

302
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:42,200
-How often?
-Once every two days I think.

303
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:50,500
-But you still need to masturbate in between?
-I have masturbated in between, yes.

304
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,700
-And the erection is better when you masturbate?
-Yes.

305
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:05,100
I have always to be aroused by her, it's never coming from myself to make love to her.

306
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,590
When we have our clothes on and we are kissing, there is no erection.

307
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:17,950
Only when we are lying in bed and she is naked...

308
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:27,440
We have some information now. What remedies are we thinking?

309
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:38,200
-Picric acid.
-Staphysagria.

310
00:41:42,700 --> 00:42:05,210
-Agnus castus, China, Lilium tigrinum, Phosphoric acid, Gelsemium.

311
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:34,700
All these remedies can be the remedy.

312
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:47,660
I will read a remedy.
-Cocculus.

313
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:54,120
-I will read the remedy and you will find the remedy.

314
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:58,880
Great exhaustion and drowsiness,

315
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:13,050
affection of the muscular fibres of stomach, very sensitive,

316
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:25,300
head confused, pain in the head as from a band tightly crossed forehead,

317
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:38,210
conscious of nose, feels as if he has two noses.

318
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,970
I played a trick because I read on a piece of paper...

319
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:20,460
I always play tricks because you have to work hard.

320
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,730
Is this the remedy?

321
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:27,300
Let me read you from another remedy.

322
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,190
There are remedies we can be thinking about.

323
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:10,710
Want of power of concentration and coordination,

324
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:17,690
numbness in the head and muscular prostration,

325
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:26,690
association of head and eye symptoms with muscular tiredness and worriness.

326
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:40,200
It produces diminution of sexual desire in both sexes,

327
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:54,690
sexual neurasthenia, depressed or lost sexual life, loss of memory,

328
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,940

329
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:12,690
confused, dull, heavy, dizzy, pressing upwards in occiput,

330
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:39,930
tired and numbed feeling in legs, staggering, worse from motion, tight clothing,

331
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:45,270
better when lying down on back, from cold drinks and eating.

332
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,610
That is another remedy.

333
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,600
They are not usual remedies what I read you. They are unusual remedies.

334
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,260
Let me read another remedy.

335
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:20,010
What was this remedy I just read? It was Onosmodium.

336
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:28,590
The previous remedy I was reading, who found it? Nobody?

337
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:44,680
Mercurialis Perennis, the first remedy.

338
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:59,700
I read another remedy.

339
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:22,020
Marked effects on the genito-urinary organs and especially indicated for sexual atony.

340
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:31,510
Great debility, worse with heat,

341
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:44,010
easy exhaustion mental and physical, especially in old age,

342
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:48,510
debility after exhausting disease.

343
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:54,100
You are going to have a problem in differential diagnosis.

344
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:04,090
Mind, lascivious thoughts with impotency.

345
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:11,600
He has the desire, he sees the girl, he says it's nice... with impotency.

346
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,590
You are going to have a problem.

347
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:38,510
Mental labor fatigues, extreme sadness, despair, uncompromised melancholy,

348
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:45,360
this is Selenium, hair falls out. You see his hair is out already.

349
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:13,600
Male, dribbling of semen during sleep, loss of sexual power with lascivious thoughts,

350
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:19,950
increases desire and decreases ability for sex,

351
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:35,710
sexual neurasthenia, on attempting coition penis relaxes, Selenium.

352
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,700
You will have a problem, I told you.

353
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:50,600
All these remedies are unusual remedies but in its own way each one describes

354
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,210
some of his state.

355
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:08,520
Which is the remedy?
-Lycopodium?

356
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:14,520
-Lycopodium was tried again with no effect. No point in trying it again.

357
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:23,450
It gave a bad aggravation, he lost the contact with the world, he became unreal etc.

358
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:31,610
-Can we find it through the Repertory?

359
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:47,830
-Yes you can try. There are some people who have seen the case and I believe

360
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:50,200
they remember the remedy.

361
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:02,450
Who has seen the case? Do you all remember the remedy?

362
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,700
Who does not remember the remedy?

363
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:14,950
All the others remember the remedy? You understand the tricks...

364
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:30,450
But what I read you was close enough? Very close.

365
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:50,100
-You said once that after Baryta carbonica... the extremities was strong, then we look at...

366
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:56,690
the mental level is better and the physical level is aggravated.

367
00:52:56,790 --> 00:53:02,360
So you don't have to consider to wait if Baryta carbo is the right remedy?

368
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:09,760
-I think there is enough time between Baryta carbo and the time I've seen him.

369
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:38,110
What actually happened when I prescribed the remedy, his practitioner played him a trick.

370
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:44,360
He gave him another remedy and he said this is the remedy that George prescribed.

371
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,870
-Why?

372
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:01,610
-I don't know why. You don't understand why?

373
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:15,430
So he did not take the remedy I prescribed until how many months later he took it?

374
00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:18,000
-Between 4-6 months.

375
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:25,450
-4-6 months after this consultation, he took the remedy I prescribed.

376
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,420
-Did you advice then?

377
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:44,170
-No, I did not advice then. I advised to take the remedy, I'll tell you which remedy.

378
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:53,350
But I did not give him the remedy, so he went back to his country and the practitioner gave him

379
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:59,100
another remedy and told him this is the remedy that George has prescribed.

380
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,830
-Why?

381
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:04,180
-You don't understand why. I don't understand either.

382
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:12,360
I have some suspicions but it's better not to voice them.

383
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:28,110
On the second interview the situation...

384
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:38,200
Which remedy you prefer out of the 3-4 remedies I read you?

385
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,440
-Mercurialis.

386
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:47,940
-Let's see a bit more.

387
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:58,500
-When we have our clothes on and we are kissing then there is no erection,

388
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:03,420
just only when we are lying in bed and she is naked there is erection

389
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:09,260
and she has always to caress me or do something.

390
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:19,240
When I had Lycopodium, when I had the second time Lycopodium, I was walking in the streets,

391
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:25,680
it wasn't even spring and I had erections all the time. I had to put my mind to things.

392
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:32,760
I was always walking in the street with an erection all day.

393
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,550
That was so strange with Lycopodium.

394
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:50,930
-Do you usually have any reaction from the weather?

395
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:57,830
-When it's too warm is worse, when it's windy it's worse,

396
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:02,830
when it's very crowded and warm it's worse.

397
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:07,090
That's why I was afraid to come to Greece because it's always warm here

398
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:14,660
but too much dry when I was in Athens. Everything was good in my head, no problem.

399
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:27,080
-Actually you are afraid of the heat but now you found out that you can tolerate it?

400
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,830
-I can tolerate it now but 2-3 months ago I couldn't.

401
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:36,080
I was going to the beach in Holland where it's not warm like in Greece

402
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:42,930
and they were very many people there and everything went strange.

403
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,150
-Because of the heat?

404
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:52,250
-Because of the heat and the many people and the colors and the wind.

405
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:29,490
If I would write it down now it would be another story. Every time I go to the homeopath

406
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:34,590
the symptoms have changed a little and I would tell another story.

407
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:52,240
-Do you cry easily?
-No I don't think so. Do I cry easily?

408
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,090
-Just a bit of tears.

409
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:05,590
-It's like in a situation I cry and when that situation occurs again I don't cry anymore.

410
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:15,840
I've cried the last few weeks when I'm with this girl which is quite a new situation for me.

411
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:24,550
Three days ago she told me she loves me and she wants to live together

412
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:31,410
and have children maybe but I don't' love her. I like her, she is good for me I think.

413
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,300
-But you don't have the feelings?

414
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,810
-I don't have the feelings of love, so I'm not going to live with her or anything

415
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:47,650
and I was so afraid that she would leave me when I told her, that I had to cry.

416
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:58,550
I cried because I was so afraid she would go away and that is very strange

417
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:03,410
because I  think maybe I will leave her.

418
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:15,300
Because it is lasting too long.

419
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,380
-How long is lasting?

420
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:31,250
-20 years is very long, we may be together 20 years with this girl.

421
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:37,140
-Wait a minute, 20 years with this girl?

422
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:41,650
-No, I'm just a few months with this girl. I know her for about 3 years

423
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:51,470
but if I don't put an end to it now or in a few months, I may stay 20 years

424
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:57,050
and I can't see a period of time to stay with one person.

425
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,910
-Why? If you like her?

426
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:16,330
-If I look at another girl, I think what a beautiful girl that one is...

427
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,080
When I see this girl, I can't go to bed with the other.

428
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:27,250
-But you can't go to bed anyhow. You had difficulty for so many years.

429
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:37,480
Why don't you stick with her? Why don't you stay with her?

430
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,720
Because you had so many problems?

431
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:49,800
-But I don't love her. You need to feel a little bit of love. You have to feel warm feeling,

432
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:57,560
when you see her, you have to be glad that she is there and I really don't care if she is there.

433
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:02,490
She might have been some other girl.
-I see.

434
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:27,800
This numbness that you have in the legs it's only in the legs or also in hands?

435
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:42,640
-It's in the arm and the hands and not to legs, just the calves and the feet

436
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:46,240
and especially the soles of the feet.

437
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:55,240
The legs and calves are always prickling and in the arms is just a part of it.

438
01:02:55,340 --> 01:03:02,980
Sometimes these two fingers, sometimes just a little piece of the finger,

439
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:11,500
it's not the whole arm that feels... Just a little part of it.

440
01:03:15,770 --> 01:03:21,000
In the arms I never have the contractions. The contractions are only in the calves.

441
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:31,150
Sometimes it feels like a little burning is here and when I look at the calf

442
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:38,500
I see very little contraction and sometimes it's inside the calf, I think.

443
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:08,510
When I came to Athens there was still the tendon that fits the calf to the knee

444
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:13,080
was very painful but now it's gone.

445
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:37,740
It was very painful when I came to Athens but it lasted only two days, now it's gone.

446
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:11,500
-How do you feel psychologically? You feel optimistic or pessimistic?

447
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:16,980
-I feel pessimistic when things are going bad.

448
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:26,990
I was even afraid that by the time I got here, I couldn't talk to you anymore

449
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:37,820
because the brain would let me down. I'm afraid that I lose contact with the world.

450
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:50,140
I don't recognize the world, I don't recognize people, the brain gets so tired

451
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:59,000
that it does not want to have anything to do with the rest of the world.

452
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:09,250
Then all of the sudden the brain clears a little bit and I feel a little bit more optimistic.

453
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:21,490
They will find for me something in time and when it's bad I'm afraid

454
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:24,830
nothing will be found in correct time.

455
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:38,830
If somebody would find a good remedy, I would be restoring less half a year.

456
01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:44,410
There is a feeling that something is just around the corner, that just the remedy is there.

457
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:50,750
I think that is optimistic.

458
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:04,250
But I haven't felt much joy in my life.

459
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:14,370
Going abroad to Greece or Spain or skiing in Austria it doesn't mean much to me.

460
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:19,620
It's something that people do. It's the same with love.

461
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:23,970
There is no joy in it now.

462
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:42,370
You have to ask me are you coming to ski with us, I say that's OK but just the eagerness

463
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:48,980
to go is not coming out of myself.

464
01:07:52,640 --> 01:08:01,540
I just told you one time with Lycopodium that I'm feeling so stupid...

465
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,910
I'm coloring the story so much.

466
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,790
-How is the stool? Anything peculiar in the stool?

467
01:08:38,890 --> 01:08:43,310
-The stool is light color brown.

468
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:56,060
The urine was always with much foam, white foam.

469
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:05,250
At first I thought it was my toilet because I used a kind of soap to my toilet.

470
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:08,100
So I told no one in the beginning.

471
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:23,040
But no special color or special odor.

472
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:25,130
-How is your sleep?

473
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:33,010
-That changes too. I had periods when I couldn't fall asleep

474
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:39,000
but then now I fall asleep rather easily and then I wake up sometimes after three hours already

475
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:42,180
and sometimes at 5 o'clock.

476
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:49,610
The last few months I fall asleep very easily and then I wake up at 5 o'clock.

477
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:55,920
I want to sleep because there is so much trouble in my head.

478
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:00,770
-Do you fall asleep again?
-I fall asleep again.

479
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:48,850
-Do you have any trembling?
-No.

480
01:10:56,530 --> 01:11:00,500
-Do you eat sweets a lot?
-I like sweets a lot.

481
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:05,860
It's the only thing I can say for liking or disliking things, it's that I like sweets things a lot.

482
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:18,260
I had distention, that was in March 85, not at the moment.

483
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:22,110
I had very much flatulence, very much wind.

484
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,500
-Any time?

485
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:31,600
-All the time from March 85 until now there is very much wind in me.

486
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:38,330
In March when it started I had distended stomach from eating just one sandwich

487
01:11:38,430 --> 01:11:45,090
or half a sandwich and I couldn't eat until 5 o'clock in the afternoon because I was...

488
01:11:45,190 --> 01:11:47,530
-Not now?
-Not now.

489
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:20,270
-Do you have a time period when you sleep very little?

490
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:25,750
-I sleep very lightly. I'm not sure.

491
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:30,750
I think just in the middle of the night I sleep very good because people are waking by bad weather

492
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:34,580
or thunderstorms and I don't wake up.

493
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:42,350
I sleep very lightly till 8 o'clock and then I can sleep for a couple of hours deeply.

494
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:48,270
-During sleep there is salivation?
-No.

495
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:20,850
-Can you have pressure in your body?

496
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:33,680
-I don't know. I have the neck open. Sometimes when I go to a concert I leave it loose.

497
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:44,330
Better when I had the distention I couldn't feel balance, I can tolerate it now

498
01:13:44,430 --> 01:13:46,360
but then I couldn't.

499
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:57,600
-Do you sleep on one position?
-I sleep mostly on my right side.

500
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:13,500
-Do you feel jealousy?
-Not anymore. I did.

501
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:19,750
-Do you feel great jealousy by the time you had this love affair?

502
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:31,590
-I think yes. I had that nobody else could take her if I couldn't. I was very jealous then.

503
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:35,590
-Would you imagine her going out with men?

504
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:39,020
-I was not imagine her, she told me.

505
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,680
She had to go to bed with him because...

506
01:14:46,780 --> 01:14:50,170
-Because he would beat her?
-Not beat her.

507
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:54,420
Let's say she would take a lift from Amsterdam to the sea side and then he said

508
01:14:54,520 --> 01:15:00,680
I want to go to bed with you, otherwise I put you out of the car. So then she did.

509
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:05,570
That is the story she told me, I don't know if they are correct.

510
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:22,740
But of course she went to bed with boys about my age and maybe 2-3 older than me

511
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:25,840
and they will be boasting about it.

512
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:37,750
I think I'm easily jealous.

513
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:50,140
Now when she tells about her other boyfriends especially when she was on holidays

514
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:56,150
with a married man who had two children, I don't feel well about it.

515
01:15:56,250 --> 01:16:03,500
In my head I know I shouldn't, past is past but I don't feel happy with it.

516
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:10,160
-When you sleep do you ever have choking during sleep?

517
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:15,250
-No never.

518
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:20,650
-Your feet are warm in bed? You have to stick them out?

519
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:23,000
-Yes I have to stick them out.

520
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:31,500
-Do you need a fan on top of you?
-No I don't need a fan.

521
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:35,500
I feel better when the head is cool but I don't need a fan.

522
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:59,240
As soon as the feet sweat and when the sweat is drying, my feet get cold

523
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:10,990
and it comes pain in the joints, then I put new socks on and then I go walking

524
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:13,340
and then the pain disappears.

525
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:33,600
After I had that coryza in 84, I had also trouble with the joints, pain in the knees,

526
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:51,190
neuralgic, always painful and it was dislocated my right shoulder when I was in a kayak.

527
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:06,780
The right shoulder it was rambling, not only cracking.

528
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:10,680
-How is your thirst?

529
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:16,010
-I don't have very much thirst. I'm not easily thirsty.

530
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:20,620
-Do you eat oysters?
-No I never eat oysters.

531
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:21,840
-Why?

532
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:27,330
-I think I don't like them. I like fish but oysters I don't like.

533
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:36,440
-Do you like salty things?
-No I don't think so.

534
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:50,180
-Salty in general?
-I don't take very much salt.

535
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:06,930
-Do you feel aversion to salt?
-No, just normal.
