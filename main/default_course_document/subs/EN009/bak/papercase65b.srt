1
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:27,580
I would like to show you now the possibility of regeneration that Homeopathy has,

2
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,460
which appears in a case some of you have experienced, have seen it in Celle.

3
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,070
The gangrene case in Celle.

4
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:52,100
I will show you the follow up after 10 years in a very short way.

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:58,450
Who saw this case, the gangrene case in Celle?

6
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,350
Only 6 people.

7
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,100
Anyhow instead of showing the whole case...

8
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:21,590
This is a case which shows the possibilities that Homeopathy has for regeneration.

9
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,340
Regeneration of the cells, regeneration of the tissues of the body.

10
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,290
I can give you a nutshell of the case.

11
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:41,010
I was teaching in Celle and the first day we started the teaching,

12
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,260
they were about 300 students.

13
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:51,160
One of the student, a woman doctor, stood up and said my mother

14
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:57,510
is in the hospital in Celle and they are preparing to cut both her legs,

15
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:08,610
amputate her legs from the thigh and would it be able to do something?

16
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,320
I asked her when they were planning the operation?

17
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,600
It was Friday, they said for Tuesday.

18
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:24,330
We had Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, 4 days to show maybe

19
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:33,920
that Homeopathy could start having again some circulation in the arteries

20
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,220
and the veins.

21
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,700
It was a possibility to show in the doctors in the hospital

22
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,750
that something is happening, so they can decide to delay the operation

23
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,860
and then we have a little bit more time.

24
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:07,260
I remember this was a very electrified atmosphere in the class,

25
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,250
waiting to see the results of Homeopathy, if it can have a result.

26
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:20,510
The interesting thing was that the woman had diabetes and she arrived

27
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:31,080
at a state of gangrene because of the closing of the arteries

28
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,580
and the developing of the gangrene, due to long time diabetes.

29
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:45,830
But while she was in the hospital and they investigated her, they found out

30
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:52,940
that she was suffering with adenocarcinoma of the lungs as well.

31
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:05,430
So this was a great challenge for Homeopathy, could we do something till Monday?

32
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,920
First of all she was in the hospital and we could not film her in the very beginning.

33
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,510
We could only have some pictures of her legs.

34
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:40,240
I will show you the patient. The patient is 6 months after the initial treatment.

35
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,610
I will show you the follow up when she came.

36
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:53,580
She was showing some effect in the arteries, the doctors

37
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,000
and to their credit I must say, I didn't expect, they said yes

38
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:06,450
we see some effect and we agree to wait.

39
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,990
They waited until one more week.

40
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:19,640
One more week they observed her and after that week the patient

41
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:29,640
was sent to another clinic, not to a surgical ward, to stay there.

42
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:34,390
She stayed there for another week or 10 days and then she was discharged

43
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,640
from that hospital as well and she went back home.

44
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,440
And treatment continued for 2 years.

45
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:53,390
I will show you now the first follow up 6 months after the initial treatment.

46
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:10,060
-In December 88, with an inclusion of artery right and the right leg,

47
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:18,640
they did a vasectomy.

48
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:27,390
It was tried to dissolve the fungosis.

49
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:35,620
They also found when she was in hospital that she had an adenocarcinoma in her lung,

50
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:44,120
in her left lower (?) discussing and I was operated in February 89.

51
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,500
Then she did not have any problems for about 2 years.

52
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,920
In June 91 she had an (?) on her right foot.

53
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,920
She got antibiotics but there wasn't any major improvement.

54
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,680
Then they did and angiography and they found that there was an occlusion

55
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,920
in her right (?) artery.

56
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:11,680
In June 91 she got a by-pass operation, by-passing the (?) artery

57
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,920
going from the (?) with her leg artery.

58
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:24,190
After some days this by-pass again got closed.

59
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,790
Her situation got worse in spite of medical treatment,

60
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:39,000
so in July she got into hospital in Celle and since you were here,

61
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,350
you looked at her then.

62
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,270
That was the condition by that time.

63
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,690
The foot was taken as it was at the time.

64
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,190
For 5 days she got Anthracinum C30.

65
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:50,680
-That is on 9 of September.
-This is 13th of September.

66
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:19,270
14th of October.

67
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:56,260
28 of October.

68
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:27,380
16 of December.

69
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,570
They remember, most probably those who have seen the follow up,

70
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:55,630
the treatment was continued for 2 years, another year and a half.

71
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:04,790
And since then I lost the case, I did not know what happened.

72
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:13,750
Lately I wanted to present this case to a Symposium here in Thessaloniki,

73
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:24,880
where about 20 medical Professors of Medicine and Directors of hospitals were present.

74
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:35,490
I asked my secretary to find the woman doctor and find out what has happened

75
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:40,530
after the 2 years of follow up which I was following the case.

76
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:47,420
Here it is her letter which I would like to read to you.

77
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,580
-How did you continue the treatment? Did you keep on with Anthracinum?

78
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,380
-No I will tell you the remedies.

79
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,550
Anthracinum was only at a certain point when the pains were unbearable.

80
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:12,470
I will tell you the treatment in the end. The treatment is not only Anthracinum.

81
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:31,880
She found her and she sends this letter on the 12th of August 99, last month.

82
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,640
She says dear George your treatment of my mother was very successful.

83
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:48,300
She was in a good condition till she died at the October 98, 26 of October 98.

84
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,700
At this morning she probably had a stroke, she was very weak and tired

85
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,200
and didn't want to get up.

86
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:07,950
She fell into sleep again and when we called the doctor from the village,

87
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,890
he recognized that she was going to die.

88
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:18,800
He observed her last minutes without interference.

89
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,370
She died in a very tranquil way. It was like her way to live

90
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:31,950
and I'm filled with gratitude. Your treatment was unbelievable.

91
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,860
It was like a wonder to change her dangerous condition

92
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,740
and I want to thank you very much.

93
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,620
Further the information is interesting.

94
00:13:45,720 --> 00:14:01,220
In 96 she fractured the column femoris, she got a TEP and recovered in a short time.

95
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:08,050
No complication of the circulation or any other parts of the body.

96
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,700
After a few days she was able to walk and this condition continued

97
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,210
till the end of her life.

98
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:26,220
I showed a few such cases to these Professors.

99
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,530
As they confessed in the end, everyone of them said,

100
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,950
we came prejudiced against Homeopathy.

101
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,200
We came because some students of ours, medical doctors,

102
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,950
especially those who were in the army, army doctors,

103
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:51,190
they invited us to come but we came prejudiced.

104
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:58,450
After seeing all that, I showed them a few cases, we have to admit

105
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,450
that Homeopathy is something which is quite serious

106
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:07,040
and they did the first step for Greece.

107
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:13,220
They signed all of them a Manifesto in favor of Homeopathy.

108
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:28,120
For the first time it went to the Press and it became a major turning point

109
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,990
for Homeopathy in Greece.

110
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:40,880
At least they sat down and observed what we had to show them.

111
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:51,370
The turn, the change in their mentality was really impressive

112
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,120
because they came to me, knowing I'm not a medical doctor,

113
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,120
within all the medical doctors, they had to admit that yes,

114
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,120
there is something which is quite serious.

115
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,790
And they said, all of them, we were prejudiced, we didn't want to even discuss

116
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:17,280
but when we see things like that we can not really keep on with the same attitude.

117
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:27,070
What this case shows is the possibility that Homeopathy has in regenerating

118
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,320
the human organism.

119
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:38,570
This is what has to come out to the world, to understand

120
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,820
that this is not a method of treatment simply,

121
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,820
it is a method that regenerates the human body.

122
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,840
It makes the human body young again.

123
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,660
She was dying, there was no question.

124
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:02,570
There was a Polish surgeon in the class, he got up and said I have operated

125
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:08,820
1000 such cases. You remember?
-Yes.

126
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:14,820
-I showed this case with the Italian group, there was a surgeon,

127
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:22,310
he got up and said I can confirm in such cases we amputate both legs.

128
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,120
What is more interesting is the adenocarcinoma,

129
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,460
which is found out during the examination in the hospital

130
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:41,710
and still Homeopathy could keep up the organism with all these problems.

131
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:52,930
The treatment was, for those who remember, the treatment started with Arsenicum album.

132
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:01,290
With these cases you don't have much to go about but what I have seen it was

133
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:10,140
that it was June or July in Germany, in Celle.

134
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:17,870
The weather was quite warm and the woman in the hospital was covered

135
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:20,970
with 2-3 blankets.

136
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:34,120
Of course she was feeling cold in her legs but I saw she had a fan

137
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:45,220
and she was fanning her face and the pains were not so great at the moment.

138
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:55,870
Two of those toes, one in the one and one in the other leg, they fell off,

139
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:03,490
they were totally destroyed, they were totally black and gangrened.

140
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:12,890
There was no other measures to help her, with any other way and you could see

141
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,880
the healing signs that they were going on.

142
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:35,490
When the second day we had already an effect of Arsenicum and she started uncovering

143
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:41,630
and then we took the case constitutionally, to find out

144
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,390
what might be the constitutional remedy.

145
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,380
Who remembers what was the second remedy?

146
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,980
-Sepia.
-Sepia very good.

147
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,710
Most probably it was her constitutional remedy.

148
00:19:54,810 --> 00:20:02,120
So we continued with Arsenicum, adding Sepia to the case

149
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,050
because there was no time to lose.

150
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,380
On Monday evening they had to examine and they had to find

151
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,310
that the arteries were pumping a little bit of blood.

152
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:31,960
Anthracinum came later on when these ulcers started being activated

153
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:38,720
and then the pains started and the pains were severe, burning pains with deep,

154
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,460
black ulcers.

155
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:47,210
And I said Anthracinum and then after Anthracinum it was Hepar Sulphur.

156
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:54,000
I can't remember now, it is recorded all the treatment but the most important

157
00:20:54,100 --> 00:21:02,750
it was Arsenicum in the beginning, with Sepia together, intercurrently.

158
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:08,020
We give one Arsenicum and after an hour one Sepia.

159
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,860
-How?
-Orally.

160
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,120
-How high?
-Who remembers?

161
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:25,380
-11,12.
-C12.

162
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:34,690
-I think it started with 4X also, very low Arsenicum first

163
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:38,290
and then you went a little higher.

164
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:48,360
-It was a low potency and the main thing for us to see

165
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,620
is the possibility of regeneration.

166
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,110
We are not acting locally, we are acting on the whole organism

167
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,360
and that's why the organism can remain for years in such a good condition,

168
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,460
as she describes.
