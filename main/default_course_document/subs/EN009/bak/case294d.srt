1
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:30,680
-I have to say that I'm very excited to read my report because old things came up and

2
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,030
have been actualized by the remedy.

3
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:43,790
I want to give the title to this report. An old wisdom is saying, die before you live.

4
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,960
After I've been home, I had a state of indifference for about 2 days and on the third day

5
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,620
a heaviness in my legs started.

6
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:03,620
It was a lead like heaviness, especially in the thighs which made it nearly impossible

7
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:13,540
for me to climb steps. Every step was combined with pains in my thighs and even going

8
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:21,890
up to my office, which means climbing up one set of stairs, I had to interrupt 3 times.

9
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,790
-So much. Most of the heaviness was on thighs or on legs?

10
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,140
-It was totally in the legs but the main point was in the thighs.

11
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,620
I didn't get enough air, I was completely exhausted if I was taking 3 times the 3 steps.

12
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,620
This state was going on for about 2 weeks and nevertheless I was able to go on with the

13
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:59,950
work in my practices, my patients even remarked that I was inwardly disturbed but

14
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:06,200
nevertheless I could follow the duties of my practices and keep going.

15
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,140
Very orderly concerning the orders I was conducting my practices.

16
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:27,450
Afterwards my back was aching, the lower part and for about 8 days it was nearly unbearable pain.

17
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,210
-In the lower part of thoracic region or lower part of the back?

18
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:41,700
-Like lumbago, in the lower part of the spine. Then this heaviness went up to my head.

19
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,900
And I felt like being surrounded by fog. And my thinking got very very slow and heavy.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,430
An incredible tiredness overcame my whole body, my whole organism and I permanently

21
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,180
had the desire to lie down and just sleep.

22
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:12,080
But the pressure in my (?) region that later on had gone down to my stomach was dissolving.

23
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,830
Of course I had the most difficulties to go on doing my practices because of the

24
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:25,730
slowness of my thinking and the difficulty to actualize knowledge.

25
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,240
So often helped myself by sending my patients for 5 minutes back into the waiting room

26
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:37,480
to study the case again, to reactualize the knowledge because the knowledge was there

27
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:43,580
I just couldn't get and use it. And so then called them back after 5 minutes.

28
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,730
About 6 weeks later, I had a horrible dream.

29
00:03:49,170 --> 00:04:00,570
I was called out of my bed at night, I was brought to Court which was consisting of

30
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:07,330
University Professors going back to the time when I was studying at University and in

31
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,100
this Court was my father too.

32
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,710
-As a Judge?

33
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:21,100
-No as a Judge, he was sitting in the room and they were accusing me that I had been

34
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,090
treating two intensive care patients homeopathically.

35
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:32,970
Which and I could prove this when I was defending myself, which got better by my

36
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,820
homeopathic treatment.

37
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:49,150
But they said that I had given away, I had betrayed the knowledge that I got from them.

38
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:58,060
I asked my father if he would have anything to comment on my behalf to defend me and

39
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:07,820
he said no, nothing. And so they judged me and withdrew my license to practice Medicine.

40
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,970
-Does he feel that he ever treated such cases?

41
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:21,220
-I have been treating two such cases, I really did this actually.

42
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,220
-And the cases in the dream were concerning these two cases?

43
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,150
-Not exactly but similar.

44
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,330
The following days were very difficult for me to go to my practices and a deep

45
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,830
sadness was coming back to me.

46
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:49,170
And so suicidal thoughts came up again. I wanted to drive, go to the mountains and

47
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,520
throw myself from a high mountain.

48
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,090
And because this state was really getting unbearable, I started repertorising and I

49
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:04,840
found that Sulphur is listed in the rubric one's to throw himself from heights and I

50
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:11,640
repeated Sulphur C200. That was about 6 weeks after the first dose.

51
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:19,840
After the second dose, the suicidal thoughts disappeared but it was clear to me that

52
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:26,860
my life would go on and in front of all I would never do this to my wife, to leave her.

53
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,940
-He was thinking of leaving his wife?

54
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,340
-No, he said that I was very sure that my life would go on and I would never impose

55
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,690
such terrible fact to my wife to leave her by suicide.

56
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,670
The next thing that was remarkable was that my sexual desire completed vanished.

57
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:02,670
I had the impression that my sexual energy was going upwards and spreading like

58
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:08,270
around the navel and going upwards into the inner part.

59
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:16,200
At the same time I had the feeling of a tender dedication ,devotion to my wife.

60
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,100
-The feelings about his wife became deeper?

61
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,770
-Yes. I wanted to talk about some physical symptoms that appeared.

62
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,900
Several times I got very sour lips and herpes.

63
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,160
Then the old symptom reappeared pains in my left leg that were impeding my sleep.

64
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:51,410
Then a new symptom came, strong, cramp like pains in my neck and the permanent

65
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:56,020
desire to cover my neck with a (?_.

66
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:02,390
-When he says neck, he means the back of the neck? -Yes.

67
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,140
-And he had to cover it because he was sensitive to drafts?

68
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,030
-Yes, I got very sensitive to draft and to wrap it up with a (?) was really ameliorating very much.

69
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,310
 And it was going that far because we always sleep with an open window

70
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:27,410
I would protect my neck by wearing the (?) at night too.

71
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,430
The backaches, after this crisis of about 14 days duration, got bearable then but they

72
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:39,770
got worse by standing, they got worse by seating up right.

73
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,870
I always had to bend to ameliorate them.

74
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:52,260
Nevertheless I had a very strong desire to straighten up, to end to walk upright, straight.

75
00:08:52,360 --> 00:09:02,680
And I had this inner feeling nobody is ever allowed again to break my back.

76
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:12,600
-One question. In previous years he was ever teaching in the University?

77
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,290
-When I was assistant at University, I was teaching too.

78
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:25,520
Then I got very sensitive gums. The mucus membranes on the gums got very sensitive

79
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,370
and it was easily bleeding.

80
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,930
A new symptom was that I got an urge to go for stool after eating.

81
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:44,430
And another symptom was that my finger nails were tearing the length, alongside.

82
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:52,930
Now it exists an irresistible desire for order and I do everything that has to be done on that day

83
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,250
and I never leave my practices without doing the least bit that had to be done.

84
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,000
So I was finishing every day with a good feeling that I could die, a good inner feeling

85
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:14,100
that everything is in order and if something would happen to me, I could die in peace.

86
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:22,250
There is still a lack of courage and an anxious feeling in the morning which are at least

87
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:30,750
ameliorated for about 50-60 % in comparison with what it has been.

88
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:37,830
Especially in correlation with a total disappearance of this pressure feeling in my thorax

89
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,680
and in my abdomen.

90
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:47,580
I'm still easily embarrassed and my memory got better though but still I have problems

91
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,190
to actualize, to immobilize my knowledge quickly.

92
00:10:53,180 --> 00:11:03,530
In front of all I have these tormenting thoughts for words or sentences that I have read before.

93
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,540
-Repeating? Trying to remember?
-Recollecting.

94
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:24,780
There is still an indifference towards pleasure and enjoyment and that

95
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:34,300
is especially when around several people talking, I have to ask 3 times to find out what has been said.

96
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,710
But I have the impression that my inner energy is getting more and that I'm slowly

97
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,700
in small steps opening up to my surroundings.

98
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:53,210
I got very sensitive in my feelings towards my 3 daughters and I always have to cry

99
00:11:53,310 --> 00:12:00,460
without any limits on the telephone when they talk to me or write to me, when they

100
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,710
say they have a very understanding father.

101
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:10,290
And it's terrible to think about it that for 40 years I have been able to give all this love

102
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:15,790
and attention and energy to my patients but that I have been unable to give, during the

103
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:21,970
age of rising them, the same amount of love and attention to my daughters.

104
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,460
-So he feels guilty for that?

105
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:35,810
-I don't feel guilty anymore because I know that my 3 daughters have forgiven me.

106
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:47,140
Often I'm angry and annoyed about my patients and I feel this anger and annoyment

107
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:56,140
against my patients and my profession which has been hindering me to show the same

108
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,890
amount of intensity and devotion for my family.

109
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,640
That I have really made a very important step in my development, I got to know, I found

110
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:15,410
out when this year I have been in England in an English family where I try to improve

111
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,120
my English knowledge...

112
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,900
-What year was that?

113
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,700
-This year, in March. This is connected to my desire to open more to my environment

114
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,200
to my surroundings and to be more able to communicate with them.

115
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:43,130
And with this family father at the same time he has been my teacher of English.

116
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:50,280
I had a pretty heavy discussion, argument with him and he had really deeply insulted me

117
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:58,600
because ha again tried to put me back into the form rubric of a Nazi, because I was German

118
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:04,850
but I was accepting this argument and later on he was apologizing and saying

119
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,400
that I might be different German.

120
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,330
That was for me the sign that I really made a step ahead, that I'm able to accept an argument and

121
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,730
too that it is possible by talking and speaking with one, another,

122
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,080
there is a sort of possible understanding.

123
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,330
That's the end of my report.

124
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:41,500
-I want to know if this sensitivity on the neck still continues.

125
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,350
-It's still there slightly but it got better meanwhile.
I forgot something very important.

126
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:53,830
After these few silent thoughts have not completely vanished, I took Sulphur 1M on the

127
00:14:53,930 --> 00:15:02,340
24th of January 1999 and these thoughts completely vanished then.

128
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,420
-Also he was talking about this heaviness in the head.

129
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:18,080
This heaviness went away? Slowly is going down, completely gone or still is there?

130
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,580
It's still there for about 30%.

131
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,580
-His desire for order continues?

132
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:38,580
-Yes, it's still there and it costs me a lot to overcome myself. It's still very strong need and

133
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:45,620
desire for this order but at the same time it costs me a lot of energy to overcome myself to do it.

134
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:54,370
-The emptiness he had mentioned at 11 o'clock?
-It's still there.

135
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,800
-The waking after 4,30 in the morning?

136
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:10,850
-I still wake up very early, around 5 o'clock and I still have the desire to go for stool

137
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:17,310
around 6 o'clock in the morning. And vertigo in high places got very much better.

138
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:26,140
I think that's about 20% left and standing aggravating is still the same.

139
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:43,740
-Is any difference in his temperature concerning his body or feet?

140
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:50,980
-No, it's still there but I think the intensity of heat in my feet got a little bit less and I don't

141
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,070
put them out of cover, as often as I used to.

142
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:06,030
-Also if I understood well, it's an interesting symptom, where he said I want now to sit

143
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:16,320
upright and it seems to me that inwardly feels more upright. Is that correct?

144
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:23,480
-Yes.
-The desire for sweets?

145
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:30,480
-It's still there but when I eat a bar of chocolate, I would unfortunately finished it but

146
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,810
I don't go and buy that much chocolate anymore, not to be tempted much.

147
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:50,710
-Also I understood that his feelings are opening and still the joy of life is not there.

148
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,960
Or sometimes now it may come?

149
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,960
-Yes it comes because certain songs I would sing every morning.

150
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,460
-He started singing again?

151
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:06,970
-I'm not a great singer, I'm more concerned about the context, the words, it's very important to me.

152
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,870
I'm very much occupied with music and I'm playing several instruments too.

153
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:28,460
-Also I understood that he has a better idea to look after himself.

154
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,340
-Yes, that is true. That is correct.

155
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:48,410
-OK, thank you. Still he is sighing very much, during the interview he was sighing very much.

156
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,910
Is this something that happens all the time or only here it happens?

157
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:59,520
-When I'm excited and in inner turmoil, then I'm sighing.

158
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:06,280
-But is it something that he noticed to happen frequently?

159
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,870
-Not really anymore.
-OK.

160
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:52,670
-What is your decision? Who says wait? Who says repeat? Who says higher potency?

161
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Who says repeat later?

162
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:18,920
So we don't have much to say about the case. The class is too good. Very good.

163
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:30,670
This is the right decision. I hope you have been convinced that you don't need to give

164
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,520
with everything one remedy. This is the message !

165
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:51,610
It's very important of course to evaluate correctly whether a remedy is acting or not.

166
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:57,100
This is another story because you maybe waiting on something

167
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,460
which has not acted or acted superficially.

168
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:09,110
Because, as I said, you give an Ignatia or you give a Nat. muriaticum, the patient comes

169
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:14,040
and tells you I feel better psychologically.

170
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:22,770
If you see the case has not moved, especially if you see there is no initial aggravation

171
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,620
the organism is shaken...

172
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:35,000
You remember what she says? If I have to go through all the pains, I don't want the same remedy.

173
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:44,960
Your remedy has to move the organism and then don't be afraid, let it act.

174
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,610
But if you wait on a Nat. muriaticum because he told you, he comes with headaches

175
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:57,860
with pains, with this, with that, she says I feel somewhere better psychologically and

176
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,730
you wait, you can wait for the rest of your life. Nothing will happen.

177
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:13,240
Because this is a very superficial prescription.

178
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:30,530
In the same way, I'll give you some more examples for you to understand what I mean

179
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,130
by superficial prescription.

180
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:40,530
Somebody comes and tells you that he has a pain on the right hypochondrium and

181
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:48,780
the pain is extending on the back. You immediately think Chelidonium and you give

182
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,360
a dose of Chelidonium and he comes back after 20 days and says, the pain from the

183
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,110
next day it was gone.

184
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:04,780
-Still is gone? Yes. And then you check the other organism and you see no other changes,

185
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:12,880
just this pain is gone. The most probable is that after some time even that pain will be back.

186
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:21,800
The fact that some pain will go away, it does not mean that your remedy is acting.

187
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:27,550
Maybe the patient feels that this is a good doctor because my pain goes away.

188
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:37,800
That is not the idea. Here you understood the idea of curing in a deeper level is to

189
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:44,240
see all the laws we have for a cure to be applied in the case.

190
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:59,750
Do the laws apply? Another thing which is new, even for Greek doctors who hear my

191
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:05,820
teachings since 39 years, the new thing is this.

192
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:15,740
When you see the acute arising this has to be evaluated how you are going to treat and

193
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:23,240
what you are going to give in conjunction with the treatment and usually, not always

194
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:29,090
as we explained, an acute means the case is progressing.

195
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:44,240
You remember for instance the case that we are speaking about that after Ignatia 50M

196
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:49,740
he had several acutes, which he went through without anything.

197
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:59,320
Bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, 1,2,3 acutes and after these acutes he developed

198
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:06,670
the picture of Sulphur. The Sulphur went deeper. He says, now I can stand.

199
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:12,260
I like to stand straight. We say, stoop shouldered.

200
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:21,070
It's very interesting to observe these things. In Sulphur we say, he is stoop shouldered.

201
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:31,070
It means that type where he tries to concentrate upon himself and to think and suddenly

202
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:42,670
the organism says no. Your real position is to stand straight. Forget this, your habits.

203
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:51,070
And he expressed it, not because he wanted to say, I'm not Sulphur anymore.

204
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:58,170
He just said what he felt. He felt he wants to sit straight. It's very interesting.

205
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:10,510
So therefore we conclude that this stoop shouldered position is a pathological condition

206
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:15,590
and it can be used as a symptom.

207
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:35,840
The idea is that I can not sit straight. They stand like this, tired all the time.

208
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:45,990
Not possible to stand for five minutes. Not that this symptom is enough for you to

209
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:50,090
prescribe, worse standing, Sulphur. Don't do this.

210
00:26:51,040 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm just picking some symptoms. The 11 time aggravation, you remember he had this.

211
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,250
Why do you say wait therefore?

212
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,900
Because on the one hand we see he is doing better definitely.

213
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,400
On the other hand we don't see the picture of a new remedy.

214
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,500
Still he has Sulphur symptomatology.

215
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:34,150
Therefore the most probable for you, you don't prescribe but you have in your mind

216
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:39,500
that next time he will come, most probably he will be in a Sulphur condition.

217
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:52,250
But this is supposition, it's not a certainty.

218
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:59,000
You can not say take Sulphur and after 20 days you take it. You can not say that.
