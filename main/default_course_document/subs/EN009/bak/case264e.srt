1
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:33,410
-Last time you were here we did not prescribe any remedy, correct?

2
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,740
-Yes.

3
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:42,660
-And what happened to these last 6 months?

4
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:57,350
-It happened that in these 6 months I had 4 times flu and now I have the 5th these days.

5
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:12,740
In March it was the worse because the flue started, I didn't treated it with something.

6
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:23,490
I said it will be OK, after one week it was OK and after one night the flu reappeared with

7
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:33,680
high fever and I said I'll take something; I took Aconite 5.

8
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,180
After 2 days the fever was still high.

9
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,080
-When you say high what do you mean?

10
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:54,830
-High means 39 or 39,5. It's unusual for me to have such fever.

11
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,830
-You never had in your life such a high fever?

12
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:10,080
-Only once but after I took the remedies. Before I never had fever.

13
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:18,840
And I must go for my work to Bucharest and I go with fever because I must be there and

14
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:32,330
when I came back I had pneumonia on both lungs. The next day I couldn't move from the bed,

15
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,330
I couldn't move the head.

16
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:44,580
I was without energy, I couldn't think, I was like vegetable in bed.

17
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:57,830
My husband gave me Antimonium tartar. 1M and the next day I was a little better.

18
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:13,080
The second day I can get up and do some work in the house but the cough remained 3-4 weeks,

19
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,760
I couldn't stop coughing.

20
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:32,580
Now it's the same thing. I start coughing and I feel very bad, I feel pain in all my muscles

21
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:42,830
and a bad kind of depression which you have in the flu. I can't tell you if I have or not fever,

22
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:51,580
I'm not sure but I can tell you that in the night here now I sleep with two blankets

23
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,610
and I need one more.

24
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,680
-So you feel very cold.

25
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,260
-And I became colder than before in this winter.

26
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:20,760
Also in this period I made 2 biliary colic. twice, very strong, it keeps 3 days each.

27
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,010
-Did you take pain killers?
-No,

28
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:33,260
I just drink tea, I didn't take anything, no remedies, nothing.

29
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,500
-Did you make an X-ray?

30
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:59,590
-I made an echogram and it was normal.
-There were no stones.

31
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:16,490
-I became very sensitive to the draft and to the cold weather. I immediately feel cold and

32
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,100
if I'm not attentive, I begin a flu.

33
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:44,240
A new symptom is that in the morning, quite often, I can not see very clear, it's foggy view

34
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:52,590
and I must rub my eyes but the view is the same.

35
00:05:53,090 --> 00:06:06,820
It doesn't change and it appears also if I cry, the same thing that view is not clear

36
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:16,340
and it disturbs me. I'm not able to cry so easily.

37
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:24,840
If I start crying, after 2 min. I stop. I wish to cry but I can not.

38
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:42,090
I have great desire for coffee, it's very great desire for coffee and for sweets.

39
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:54,160
I have a little problem with the salt because my husband says always you make the food

40
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:03,110
too salty and I say, no it's enough salt. If I put less salt, I say I must put some salt.

41
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:11,420
No, it's good this time you made it well and the same problem is with the sour also.

42
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:27,570
It is the same thing. If I put in the soup too much lemon, he says it's too much,

43
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,260
for me it's OK.

44
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,910
-So that means there is a desire for salt and a desire for sour also?

45
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,910
-I don't know.

46
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,460
-But comparing to your husband definitely.
-Yes.

47
00:07:47,960 --> 00:08:02,370
I became very sensitive to strong odors like vinegar, like the smell from the paint.

48
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:14,570
It produce me suffocation, I can not breathe and it's enough 20 sec. to be in contact with

49
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,170
the smell and I cough for 1 hour.

50
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:47,570
Another symptom that reappeared is that I wake up very early in the morning, 3-4 o'clock

51
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:57,320
in the morning and I go to bed at 12 o'clock. I'm not going to sleep after,

52
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,420
3-4 o'clock I can not sleep.

53
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:06,830
-And you get up in the morning at 7 o'clock?
-No, 3-4 o'clock.

54
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,820
-You get up?
-No, I stay but I can not sleep.

55
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,360
-You can not sleep until the morning when you get up.

56
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:40,760
-Yes. There are some mornings when I get up I feel the left hand numbed, I can not feel it.

57
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,410
-Only the left?
-Yes.

58
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:49,760
-And it's every day?
-Frequently.

59
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:57,840
It takes me some time to come to normal.

60
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:16,990
And I forgot to tell you when I had that pneumonia after 2 days of working in the house,

61
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,590
my husband wasn't at home.

62
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,240
-Your husband is also medical doctor?

63
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:31,740
-Yes and he also practices Homeopathy. He wasn't at home, I was alone and suddenly

64
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:45,490
I felt that I was not able to breathe. My throat was smaller and smaller and I became in panic,

65
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:57,090
I didn't know what to do, I haven't at home any remedy, it was in the office and I was scared.

66
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:08,240
At that moment I was afraid that I will die, I call a friend of mine, a homeopath also

67
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,990
and I said come to me because I'm alone, I don't know what to do and I'm scared and I'll die.

68
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:21,270
She comes and tells me what do you want to give you? Do you want to give you a remedy?

69
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:31,020
I don't know, I couldn't be logic at that moment and she proposed me to make me acupuncture.

70
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:41,090
I prefer to stay with that fear but not to put me needles.

71
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:51,860
I was terrified when I saw that needle and I don't know why and finally I said give me Apis,

72
00:11:51,960 --> 00:12:00,040
what potency? Never mind, something give me. And she gave me Apis 30.

73
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:13,760
She stayed with me until my husband came and when he was at home, everything calmed down

74
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:20,950
and I didn't have that feeling that my throat was too small and I would suffocate.

75
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:30,260
-This feeling came out of the blue without any reason or you were with flu or something like that?

76
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:43,760
-It was 2 days after pneumonia and I have frequent problems with the throat because I have no tonsils,

77
00:12:43,860 --> 00:13:08,360
my tonsils are operated and when I make flu, all my glands are swollen.

78
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:25,450
They are very swollen and very painful and all my throat is like a wound, an opened wound.

79
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:39,870
This is preparing, this is the symptom and after 2 days it will be like this.

80
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:45,270
-You know that after 2 days it will be like this.

81
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:53,620
-And it keeps 7 days and I cough 3 weeks, that is usual.

82
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,920
-I want to ask some questions, how is the constipation?

83
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:32,270
-It is still there and now appeared the hemorrhoids.

84
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:47,520
-Your nails are strong?
-They are strong, they don't break.

85
00:14:51,020 --> 00:15:01,000
-How sensitive you are to drafts? Can you give me an example?

86
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:14,850
-Very sensitive. In the class now for me it's draft, if I go in a car with the window open it's draft.

87
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:29,100
I think I took this flu in the bus from the air condition.

88
00:15:43,100 --> 00:16:00,340
-The desire for sugar is strong or it is less?
-I must eat something sweet after every meal.

89
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:07,690
-But compared with the last time I saw you?
-It's much more.

90
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,690
-What about the thirst? It's normal?

91
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:32,640
-I don't know if it's normal because in 1 day I drink 1/2 kilo, it's enough for me.

92
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,690
-Did you have any ecchymosis?
-No, they stopped.

93
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:54,190
-The desire for coffee has become more?
-More, coffee and chocolate.

94
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,920
-Do you drink coffee? 1-2 times?

95
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:08,770
-I had a lot of work last month. I think 3 times.

96
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,920
-I thought so.

97
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:22,270
-If I see coffee, it's impossible to resist. I will dream the coffee in the night.

98
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,770
-You desire forbidden things.

99
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,920
The swelling of the ankles is still there?

100
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:49,270
-Yes, now they are not swollen but when I came it was.

101
00:17:51,770 --> 00:18:00,420
-The cramps in the night?
-Yes they appeared.

102
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:10,270
I drink 1 week coffee and they appeared after the coffee and I stopped coffee because

103
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,120
they are very painful and it keeps me 2-3 days, I can not walk.

104
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:25,950
-It's good, the cramps are your friend, they protect you.

105
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:37,950
What about vertigo from high places, have you noticed any?
-No.

106
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:56,850
I can say that this time I came alone, my friend couldn't come and I'm a little depressed

107
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:06,200
because I'm alone. I desire to be with somebody, to discuss.

108
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:29,430
If it happens that I sleep another hour, when I wake up I have a terrible headache.

109
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,770
-If you sleep?

110
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:40,550
-Yes, I wake up at 4 o'clock and at 5 o'clock I sleep again. At 6 o'clock if I wake up

111
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,530
I have a terrible headache.

112
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,790
-Also you had a fear of narrow places.
-I think it's still there, not so strong.

113
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:04,780
-Also the vinegar, if you take vinegar...
-If I smell vinegar.

114
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:09,730
-Now is the smell? The last time it was the same.

115
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:27,880
-I can not breathe if I smell vinegar, 5 sec. if I'm with the vinegar I start coughing and

116
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,530
if I stay more, I can not breathe at all.

117
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:47,030
-And this coughing still continues from time to time?

118
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,120
-I have a flu and I cough for 1 month.

119
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:57,350
-Yes but now you are in a period where your coughing is over or still...

120
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:03,350
-Now it starts. From today the coughing started.

121
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:11,630
-When you have coughing it's worse in bed, worse lying down?

122
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:22,940
-Yes, it's worse lying down. I must stay half sited and sleep in this position because if

123
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:41,200
I lie down, I can not stop my coughing. I can stop it for very short period, if I drink water.

124
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:57,790
-Cold water?
-I like and I want to drink cold water but I can not.

125
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:35,540
-Was any tuberculosis in the family?
-No.

126
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:48,040
-How is the anxiety about your health?
-Not too much.

127
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:03,290
-What about the desire for fish? Still there?
-Yes.

128
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:14,290
-Eggs?
-Yes, if there are it's OK, if not OK.

129
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:52,470
-How frequently this happens in a week to wake up from 3-4?

130
00:23:52,570 --> 00:24:13,370
-In the last 3 weeks every night. In this time I watch TV for example, I can not stay.

131
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:26,520
And if I get up from the bed and do something, after a while the headache starts,

132
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,870
so I must stay lied down.

133
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:42,460
-There are any kind of dreams which are repeated?
-No.

134
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:51,960
-If you eat meat with fat it's OK, you can tolerate it?

135
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:59,160
-It depends, if it is well prepared, I eat it.

136
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,620
-You said you feel colder than before?

137
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,960
-Yes, I'm colder and the nails when I'm very cold they are blue.

138
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:39,710
-Where do you feel the...?
-Here in the neck I feel it.

139
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:24,790
And I still have desire to eat cream with sugar, I can eat a lot, on the bread.

140
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:35,800
-Now when you go to bed, you can not lie flat?

141
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:46,710
-No, I can not lie on the back because I have lumbar pains if I lie flat,

142
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,900
I must be one side or another.

143
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,800
-But as far as the coughing is concerned?

144
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:07,900
-I stay half and I put a pillow here in the lumbar region and it's OK.

145
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,300
-Perspiration during sleep?

146
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:22,900
-Not too much but if I'm cold I perspire and the perspiration is clammy.

147
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,800
-In order to sleep do you put socks?

148
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:38,650
-If it is very cold in the house, I put but usually not.

149
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:11,790
-Are you very irritable, very angry?
-Lately I'm quite irritable.

150
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:23,180
-In the constipation do you have a tendency to go for stool but you don't have an effect?

151
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:33,180
-No, it is the tendency, it is the effect but the stool is very hard and if I travel

152
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,780
I haven't stool at all 2-3 days.

153
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:14,980
-In cold dry weather you said you feel worse?
-In cold weather, it is not necessary the dry.

154
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:13,600
-Your vision that has become foggy as soon as you wake up or the whole morning?

155
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:19,450
-Not the whole morning, maybe half an hour, it depends.

156
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:49,850
And I still have those spots, I see little black spots when I read or when I look at the sun

157
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,610
or in strong light they appear.

158
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:34,150
I don't see great enthusiasm in the class. That is why I think...

159
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:49,990
You don't like homework I understand. I have avoided giving homework to this particular group

160
00:31:50,090 --> 00:32:08,410
but this is a case which I have to study more, so if I have to study more, you better study also,

161
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,340
so you suffer together.

162
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:24,010
I was starting the case inside, in front of your eyes you could hear me whispering

163
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:35,660
but you don't like homework. That's why not only you will have homework but those who will get

164
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,040
the correct remedy they will get 50 points.

165
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,260
-100!
-50, it's not so difficult.

166
00:32:49,260 --> 00:33:02,660
50 points for getting the remedy tomorrow morning, first thing in the morning,

167
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,250
not in the interval like we did at school, in the interval we studied.

168
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:22,010
Who has prescribed Kali Carbonicum? What happened? 100 and 1.

169
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:42,430
Who prescribed Causticum? 3. Who prescribed Nux vomica? 9. Sepia? 4.

170
00:33:43,920 --> 00:34:01,170
Phosphorus? 2. Alumina? 3. There is a cooperation group there.

171
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:12,920
Well the remedy which I gave was Kali carbon. 200. Thank you.

172
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:38,160
Why? If you take the symptomatology Causticum is very strong especially with the last symptom

173
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:46,810
which she had. Causticum will come up in the repertorization of anybody.

174
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:55,740
Now we had to make a decision, I had to make a decision between these 3 remedies.

175
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:02,380
Was perhaps Nux vomica because she related a kind of constipation that looks like Nux vomica,

176
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:11,680
 angry, irritable but what is the main problem?

177
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:21,110
The main problem is coughing and what is the position, if  she lies down she can not.

178
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:37,930
The second problem is sleeplessness after 3-4 a.m. and you go to the Repertory and you don't see

179
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:42,690
sleeplessness after 3-4 a.m. in the Repertory.

180
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:53,700
And I say this sleeplessness is a typical sleeplessness of Kali carbon.

181
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:03,610
It will wake up at 2 o'clock and can not sleep again.

182
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:13,410
-It says 2 not 3.
-There is 2-3 but she said 3-4.

183
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:26,830
So the second symptom according to my experience is Kali carbon. sleeplessness.

184
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:49,410
I see her as a human being quite composed, hard working and plus the sensititivity to drafts,

185
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:51,430
which is quite strong.

186
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:00,590
Kali carb. is one of the main remedies for affected from the draft.

187
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:10,240
They can spot a draft even if it is absolutely imperceptible by anybody else.

188
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:25,990
Silica also has this or Rhus tox, Psorinum, Nux vomica also but Kali carb. we especially stretch

189
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:38,160
when we teach Materia medica, the sensitivity to drafts so she has 3 keynotes, her main symptoms

190
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,010
are 3 keynotes of Kali carb.

191
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:54,490
In spite of the fact if you go to repertorization and Nux vomica may come up or Causticum may come up,

192
00:37:54,590 --> 00:38:05,550
we still we have to start with Kali carb. The fact also that she goes into frequent chest problems

193
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,090
is another indication for Kali carb.

194
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,840
This is the logic for prescribing Kali carb.

195
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,660
-The coffee?

196
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:35,330
-The coffee is Angustura is this type. Shall we give Angustura?

197
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:48,080
Maybe she is an Angustura after all or no but if you have people who have been drinking coffee before

198
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,160
and you ask these people do you like coffee?

199
00:38:53,260 --> 00:39:00,160
I have found out that many people stop treatment because they can not stop drinking coffee,

200
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,010
it's a strong habit for many people.

201
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,690
So it's not becoming a keynote the desire for coffee.

202
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:21,510
-Angustura has a strong desire for coffee but has no aggravation from coffee.

203
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,860
But she gets strong cramps after drinking coffee.

204
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:34,760
-The strong cramps I'm not sure, she said it is because of drinking coffee.

205
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:51,430
I think the coffee yes may antidote the situation and can tip her over to Calc. carb. or something

206
00:39:51,530 --> 00:40:01,040
like this, that's why you have to avoid coffee absolutely.

207
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:11,760
You remember in my interview I said, how many times 3? She says 3 yes, I drunk 3 times.

208
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:24,760
I see in the voice, in the look, I hear everything, it's very difficult that they will tell me a lie

209
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:34,440
and I will believe it, sometimes I pretend yes, yes, yes. It's another story.

210
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:42,180
-I think people that need Kali carb. wouldn't tell a lie. They are honest and straight.

211
00:40:42,280 --> 00:41:01,180
-Yes. Most yes. I did not take into consideration the 3-4, I looked into the Repertory

212
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,180
and I see no Kali carb.

213
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,040
Do you know why I did not take it into consideration? Can anybody tell me

214
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:14,640
why I did not take into consideration 3-4 and I took into consideration 2-3?

215
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:30,040
-Because the real time in which the Repertory was written was not 1 hour forward as we do on the middle

216
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:44,950
of the spring. In the middle of the spring we push watches 1 hour forward because we have decided it

217
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:52,330
like that, I don't know why they do it like this but the whole world pushes the watch 1 hour in front.

218
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:59,490
The Repertory when it was written it did not take into consideration these crazy ideas we had later.

219
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:07,840
So actually it means when she says 3-4 our time, it means actual time 2-3.

220
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:21,660
So we have to be aware of this idea because the Kali carb. will appear to be later in the aggravation,

221
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,510
if we are in the summer time.

222
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:42,760
Somebody also asked, I don't remember who asked, whether she is ticklish.

223
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:55,080
He asked for what reason? For Kali carb. But Kali carb. is especially sensitive in the soles

224
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,180
and they are ticklish in the sole.

225
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:03,180
-Would you have considered repeating the Calc. carb.?

226
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:13,780
-They were some keynotes missing from Calc. carb. that I had before and she did not have now.

227
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:28,250
That's why I prefer the Kali carb. Also during the phase of pneumonia, I think she needed Kali carb.

228
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:36,830
at that time, so maybe there is a Kali carb. which continues and to be there all the time

229
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:39,180
and that's why I prefer it.

230
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:49,590
-How is she now? I would like to know if there was any effect already?

231
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:58,510
-She can not know. How she slept last night?

232
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,510
-I didn't sleep at all.
-Very good.

233
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:24,010
-In the morning my nose was blocked and after half an hour I had pain which I have it now,

234
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:40,360
like a knife in the coxofemoral joint and I have since 1 hour flashes of heat.

235
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:55,940
My neck is stiff and I have less energy from yesterday.

236
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:23,590
-Very good prescription. Why you did not sleep? Why do you think?

237
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:37,840
-I don't know. I go to bed, I try to sleep but I can not. This happened when I start making homeopathic

238
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:48,590
treatment in Romania and my first homeopath gave me some remedies, 4-5 I can not say.

239
00:45:48,690 --> 00:46:00,780
I have 5 months of insomnia, so I get up in the morning refreshed but I don't sleep the whole night.

240
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:05,030
I hope it will not be the same.

241
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:25,010
-No, tonight you will sleep. This kind of reaction is you can say it's good apart from the sleep.

242
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:38,230
You don't like that you give a remedy and they can not sleep at all, especially after Kali carb.

243
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:48,330
who complain of staying up the whole night but let's see tomorrow.

244
00:46:50,830 --> 00:47:03,500
-And I have all night very dry mouth, I drink a lot of water and I still have dry mouth

245
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,330
not so strong like last night.

246
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:12,080
-Well, we'll see.

247
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:29,080
-We gave you a remedy for this acute that you were getting and tell us what happened.

248
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:37,420
You took it actually on Thursday?
-No, on Tuesday evening.

249
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:44,080
-It is 1 week.
-Yes.

250
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:59,650
The first night after the remedy I couldn't sleep at all, then after 2 days the cough stop

251
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:15,480
and also the sleep came, all this period I couldn't sleep. I fell asleep let's say 11-12

252
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:27,820
and I wake up at 2-3 in the morning, something like that. And I'm very tired because they

253
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:39,070
are also 6 weeks since I can not sleep at night but at home I drink coffee, so I wake up.

254
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:45,170
Here I can not drink, so I'm sleepy all the time and I'm very tired.

255
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:51,570
-You can not sleep at all after you wake up?

256
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:54,500
-After I wake up I can not sleep.

257
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,780
-And at what time you get up?
-6-7 I get up.

258
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:06,620
-You don't insist to see whether you will sleep between 6-9 o' clock?

259
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:20,920
-I must get up because I have work to come here, so I can not. If it happens, I sleep between 7 and 9.

260
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:40,330
Maybe I don't know, I try to find why this sleeplessness appeared and it is possible

261
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:49,420
to appear because of my new work. I started in April, I have some difficulties

262
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:57,180
I work in great stress and maybe because of this, I don't know.

263
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:04,680
-Do you feel the anxiety from your work?
-Yes I do.

264
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:10,830
-Whether you will have patients, whether you will manage to treat them, all this is an issue for you.

265
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:21,170
-Yes, this is one issue and the other one is that I'm in the beginning and if I do not have

266
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:31,020
enough patients, I will not be able to pay the expenses and this is another problem.

267
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:42,760
-So the anxiety is mostly financial insecurity and professional problems.

268
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:47,420
-Professional less.
-Mostly financial.

269
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:57,170
-Yes and I try to work more and more and sometimes I have the feeling that I work for nothing,

270
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:09,180
it's such a feeling. I work all day in the office, between 8.30 and 7 o'clock in the evening.

271
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,170
-Almost 12 hours.

272
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:21,340
-Yes and when I arrive at home, I start working with translations or something for

273
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:33,930
publishing till 12 o'clock. And then I wake up at 2 and it's too short to rest.

274
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:41,430
And since yesterday the cough reappeared and I feel bad.

275
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:52,760
-In the night?
-No in the afternoon and it's still there.

276
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,000
-In the night did you cough?

277
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:10,100
-No, now it's during the day. I feel like I have no energy.

278
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,790
-Of course if you don't sleep, you don't have energy.

279
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:25,690
-And because I'm tired and I cannot work this bothers me because I have no time to be ill or tired

280
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:29,900
and the desire for coffee is very strong.

281
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,190
-Yes. Do you have any other symptom?

282
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:50,230
-Since yesterday it reappeared the flashes of heat.

283
00:52:56,010 --> 00:53:02,220
-Strong?
-So and so, not very strong.

284
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:04,970
-Anything else?

285
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:32,200
-During the day I have a moment between 2,30 and 3 o'clock where I can sleep anywhere.

286
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:46,870
The desire for sleep is so strong, I can not keep my eyes open and if I fall asleep,

287
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:51,720
I sleep 10 min. on the chair, it doesn't matter.

288
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:56,060
-You mean in the afternoon?
-Yes.

289
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:03,300
2,30-3 o'clock, something like that.

290
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:31,180
But I cannot sleep more than 10-15 min. then I wake up, I feel a little refreshed.

291
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:15,100
-Sulphur. I hear you sighing 2-3 times here, you do it more frequently?

292
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:24,680
-No, I observed 2-3 days here, I noticed myself.

293
00:55:25,930 --> 00:55:34,410
-Why didn't you tell it? Not to misguide me so I give you also Ignatia,

294
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:36,760
you don't feel like taking Ignatia.

295
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:48,010
What about fruits? Do you eat fruits or not very much?

296
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:51,340
-Since last year I like to eat fruits.

297
00:55:54,850 --> 00:56:00,840
-Before?
-Not so much but last summer I eat a lot of fruits.

298
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:12,480
-Perspiration where is mostly perspiration?
-In the axillae.

299
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:36,120
I'm always in a hurry and must do things very quickly and I start to do many things

300
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:47,610
at the same time and I must finish them all because if I don't finish them I don't feel well.

301
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:53,110
-Let me ask you another question. You had this change in your profession. You decided

302
00:56:53,210 --> 00:57:04,110
to go privately etc. How do you feel that your husband is? He supported you or he left you

303
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:06,200
alone in this issue?

304
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:12,770
-No, he supported me but at the end of this year he has to pass an exam,

305
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:21,700
so when I come home I am alone and he is not able to support me because he has to study.

306
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:27,200
So I will be alone and he will not be able to support me at all.

307
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:40,690
-Did you feel any kind of disappointment from this situation?

308
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,560
-No, I'm not disappointed.

309
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:49,040
-Either from his behavior or something else that caused that grief?

310
00:57:49,790 --> 00:58:04,230
-No, except from the fact that it's a new situation, it's a choice and I'm at the beginning.

311
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:16,940
I didn't work for 4 months because I had to do a lot of papers and have the permission to work in the office

312
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:25,390
and now I started, the patients are not so many because I lost the patients in that period of time,

313
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:43,350
so the problem is if I will be able to manage with this situation and if I will be able to have enough money

314
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:50,470
to pay all the taxes and to live also.

315
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:34,190
-Tuberculinum not Medorrhinum. With my first banana he makes me Tuberculinum.

316
00:59:50,810 --> 01:00:03,180
-3 rubrics anxiety business about and sleeplessness midnight after 3 o'clock,

317
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,050
Nux vomica after 3 o'clock in the morning.

318
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:14,500
And not that Nux vomica is a very good remedy for sleeplessness

319
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:25,340
and she has a lot of thought about her work.

320
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,930
-A lot of thoughts keep you awake?

321
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:41,180
-Not all the time, sometimes if I can not sleep.

322
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:50,260
-There is a rubric that might be better. It's a mind fear of business failure.

323
01:00:56,430 --> 01:01:03,330
-Do you feel cold or you became more warm after Kali carb.?

324
01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:14,360
-I think it's cold because somebody told me you dressed like in winter, yesterday morning.

325
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:33,360
After Calcar. I'm more cold, after Sepia I was more warm. Now I'm more cold.

326
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:41,510
-Now you are more cold and the sensitivity to air draft is still there?

327
01:01:41,610 --> 01:01:52,350
-Yes. I want to mention that the sleeplessness is for 6 weeks not for 8 days.

328
01:01:53,860 --> 01:02:11,760
-The sleeplessness it appears to be the underline problem, the deeper problem from the acute,

329
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:16,270
so she had the acute and she had sleeplessness. So we gave a remedy for the acute,

330
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:20,690
the acute was touched but the sleeplessness was not touched.

331
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:24,530
We have to find what was underneath

332
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:32,450
and the interesting thing is that Nux vomica is complementary to Kali carb.

333
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:35,700
-And to Sepia.

334
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:52,450
-Nux vomica is a good idea, is the correct idea? This is what you have to find out.

335
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:30,830
Fear of poverty, anxiety about business you have to take out one of the two.

336
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:41,470
Fear of poverty, take it out. Do you have any constipation?

337
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:43,010
-Yes a chronic one.

338
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:53,480
-What type? No urge? 2-3 days no urge or there is urge but no effect?

339
01:03:55,740 --> 01:04:00,480
-No, it can pass 2-3 days without any urge.

340
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,970
-And the stool is soft or hard?

341
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:18,820
-Hard. Now from the diet I eat something to have stool next morning, I must take care.

342
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:27,320
-But if you take care, that means if you eat zucchini?

343
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:31,100
-The stool is still hard.

344
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:37,310
-Is it like sheep dung?
-Yes.

345
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:52,210
-I'll tell you something. I was not in Nux vomica though the computer was saying,

346
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:59,560
I didn't want to give Nux vomica and I wanted to give a remedy which is similar to Nux vomica.

347
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:04,070
It contains the same substance which is Ignatia.

348
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:25,790
-But you persuaded me that your thinking with your computers is better than mine,

349
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:41,030
so we will give... what potency? Let's give 200 Nux vomica. See if you sleep tonight.
