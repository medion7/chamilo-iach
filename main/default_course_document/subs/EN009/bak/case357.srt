1
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,990
-Tell us your story.

2
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:29,660
-I have this cough about 3 weeks and 2,5 weeks ago I took Ignatia 1M

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,650
because I wanted to be fit to be able to come here

4
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:38,230
but the amelioration was only for a while and now it's aggravating again more and more.

5
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,250
It's really bad in the evenings and in the mornings.

6
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:48,410
During the day it's not quite bad and it's changing, I can hardly tolerate cigarette smoke,

7
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,820
talking and laughing aggravates and cold air,

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,700
if I ride my motorbike home at night I have to cough.

9
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,720
-What I see is she has almost an asthmatic breathing now, how did it start?

10
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:11,970
It started as a cough, as a bronchitis, laryngitis, pharyngitis, where?

11
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,720
-It started slowly only a little bit in the beginning which slowly got worse

12
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,140
and after Ignatia M it got better and the cough got loose

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,490
but now it's getting continuously aggravating again.

14
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,480
-She was smoking?
-Only once for a while and I don't inhale.

15
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,890
-As I understand, it just started as a cough?
-Yes.

16
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,890
In the very beginning was only a cough, nothing else.

17
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,620
Now last week for 3 days I had pain in my throat, then I had pain in my left ear

18
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,060
and now I have a coryza but it all started with a simple cough.

19
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,040
I would like to tell you something about what preceded the cough.

20
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:05,830
From my very early childhood, since I can remember, I had frequent severe bronchitis

21
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:13,290
and this lasted until I was adult and I used to have a bronchitis 2-3 times every winter,

22
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,060
lasting for about 4 weeks, just always like that.

23
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,640
-Until what year?
-Until about 10 years ago.

24
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,880
Then I received Tuberculinum, that really helped me a lot with it

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:37,250
and you have to know that someone of the family had tuberculosis.

26
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,380
And about 3,5 years ago I developed a severe depression.

27
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,380
And for 2 years during this depression, I had no acutes at all.

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,620
I received two remedies. The first one was Aurum mur.

29
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,120
which really helped me out of the depression and then after 1 year, I got Ignatia.

30
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,210
After Ignatia I developed a very severe acute which lasted 1 week.

31
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,700
I had a very severe bronchitis, I was coughing almost constantly,

32
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:12,080
my temperature was 38,5 degrees Celsius and every night I was only able to sleep for 1 hour,

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,060
I was very severely ill.

34
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,710
Just about time we were going through this 4 group during your lessons,

35
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,820
I was very surprised and amazed to experience this myself.

36
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,290
-Is she a chiropractor doctor?
-Yes.

37
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,290
With Ignatia I was doing really very well.

38
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,310
I think I repeated it 3 times all together and really my life got very good,

39
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:43,050
I had a lot of joy of life, a lot of energy and if I had the cough,

40
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,140
I only had it for 2-3 days in between.

41
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,300
-When did she receive Ignatia for the first time?

42
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,790
-About 2 years ago, in November of 97.

43
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,820
-2 years ago and the depression came for what reason?

44
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:04,610
-My partner separated from me at that time and after that I fell into this depression.

45
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:10,600
This spring something happened. I had a relationship with another man for 2,5 years

46
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,340
whom I loved really very much and we came together but then we separated again and

47
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,840
after a while he came back to me.

48
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,340
This time I really believed him and I thought he is really serious,

49
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,090
so we engaged again in a relationship and after 3 months, he again separated from me

50
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,090
and that really almost brought me back to this depression.

51
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,590
At that time I repeated Aurum mur. which helped me out of it again

52
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,420
and I still was very sad but I was stable.

53
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,440
Then in August of this year something happened.

54
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,170
Together with some other people, we were doing a canoe tour on the river

55
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:58,200
and one of the canoes tipped over and one of the people got stuck in the canoe

56
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,180
and he drowned. That really shook me up severely.

57
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,760
For more than 1 week I was in a state of shock.

58
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,990
I was just sitting there and these images kept repeating, I kept seeing these images

59
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,930
and what was really bad for me, one minute after this incident happened,

60
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,670
I passed this place with my canoe and I kept thinking maybe I could have saved him,

61
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,030
if I would be able to do something.

62
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,570
-Who else was in the canoe?

63
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,980
-I was together in my canoe with somebody else

64
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,830
but I was the person in the back stirring the canoe.

65
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:48,330
-I want to understand. In the canoe where this boy was drowned was somebody else?

66
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,480
-He was alone on his canoe.

67
00:05:50,580 --> 00:06:00,230
-She was on another canoe and most probably it was a rough water and she was in the canoe

68
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:06,650
with somebody else together and they did not realize he was drowning?

69
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,340
-The situation was the following. We could not see at first

70
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,310
because the canoe had been pressed under water and I did not know,

71
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,810
I did not see he was stuck in the canoe with his legs.

72
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,560
I assumed he was bringing himself onto safety by climbing onto some rocks,

73
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:28,310
which was not the case but things happen very quickly and you have to react very quickly

74
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:33,060
and it was one second which I had to decide which way to take.

75
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,410
And this second just passed very quickly for me, then I couldn't change anymore.

76
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,410
He was gone and it was too quick for me to make the right decision.

77
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,320
-They lost sight of the canoe?

78
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:05,560
-The canoe tipped over and it was kind of fold around the rock, as if it was made from paper

79
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,150
and he was under water and stuck in the canoe pieces.

80
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,890
His head was still above the water, it was only his feet that was stuck in the boat

81
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:21,000
but I could not see the boat and I could not see that he was still in the boat.

82
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,980
I kept having the thought that maybe there would a tiny chance to save him

83
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,730
if I had reacted in another way, although people repeatedly told me

84
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,830
you couldn't have done anything else than what you did and there was no other way of reacting.

85
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,180
-But what are her feelings after that? How she feels? She feels guilty?

86
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,240
-I thought about it a lot and I finally realized that in the situation I was in

87
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,730
I couldn't have seen it any better and I could not have reacted any other way

88
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,830
and now feelings of guilt are gone, most of them are gone.

89
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:05,390
My homeopath gave me first Opium and after Opium I came out of this shock state

90
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,240
and after that I developed a lot of fears, especially fear of death and fear of being alone.

91
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:16,310
After that my homeopath gave me Phosphorus and after Phosphorus I developed a toothache,

92
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,310
which I had had before but now it got really bad.

93
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:28,060
This toothache got so bad that I couldn't sleep anymore, I had to take pain medication

94
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,060
and that's when I made a mistake, just out of sheer desperation,

95
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,990
I started to take different remedies.

96
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:46,240
One of them was Magnesia mur., Magn. phos, the next remedy was Arsenicum

97
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,740
and my dentist treated the tooth twice.

98
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,230
She left it open, she made a new filling but the pain did not ameliorate.

99
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,170
Then she told me the tooth has to be removed.

100
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:05,980
After Arsenicum the tooth ameliorated but a couple of days later I had the operation.

101
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:13,560
After the operation I had bleeding at the area and I took Arnica 1M

102
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,780
and a couple of days later the cough started.

103
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,380
Then as I told you, I took Ignatia 1M with the cough.

104
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,040
What I also have to mention, on the day the accident happened,

105
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:35,780
that was the first day of my menstruation and after this incident it ceased immediately

106
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,540
and it came back after Opium, I think, but then it was very dark

107
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,560
and the menses then developed into leucorrhea and I also have itching in the vagina,

108
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,570
something like mycosis and the leucorrhea also was a bit offensive

109
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,930
and since then my menses did not come back. Do you want to know any other physical symptoms?

110
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,970
-Mostly I'd like to know her mental-emotional state.

111
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,580
-In general my mental-emotional state is quite OK.

112
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,820
After taking Ignatia I felt a lot better and before Ignatia I had a lot of grief

113
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:25,780
due to the situation in spring, I told you about, and here I feel quite stable,

114
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,130
quite all right being here.

115
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:36,210
Sometimes I'm a bit sad, it feels like an emotional exhaustion, as if all of this was too much

116
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:42,710
and a great fatigue, I need a lot of sleep but it feels as if something is underneath

117
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,810
when I'm not this calm.

118
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,450
Last night I woke once in the middle of the night, with palpitations

119
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,440
and then developed a kind of panic state.

120
00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:00,440
Last week during one night, I woke with palpitations and then panic arising;

121
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:06,300
then I only turned from my right side to my left side and fell asleep again.

122
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,570
A couple of days ago, I had this bad nightmare after which I also woke

123
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,340
and it was frightening.

124
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,580
-In that same state?

125
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,740
-I have to tell you some more things about the cough. It changed in the last few days.

126
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,480
Right now it also gets quite bad, when I lie down to sleep at night,

127
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,640
then I have to sit up again.

128
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,490
It's such an attack which doesn't ameliorate at all and it goes so far

129
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:44,980
that finally I'm choking. My spittle is forming white and tastes salty...

130
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,130
-If she brings out some spittle, the cough is ameliorated?

131
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,900
-Yes but only for a short while. My lymph nodes are swollen in my neck

132
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,910
and a couple of days ago in the evening, I developed a pain in my ear. The ear closed.

133
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:08,150
I could hardly hear anymore in my left side and as a child I had frequent otitis

134
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,000
and this was the first time something like that reoccurred.

135
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:21,170
Right now I have a coryza and a thick yellow secretion from the nose.

136
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,070
What is also remarkable is that my eyes are swollen in the morning,

137
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:34,670
especially around the right eye below and above the eye.

138
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,570
I'm quite restless when I go to bed due to the cough and I'm trying from one side

139
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:46,070
to the other and I have attacks of perspiration when I have to cough really severely.

140
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,660
In these cough attacks, I perspire a lot.

141
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,720
-How does she feel with the heat-cold?

142
00:12:53,820 --> 00:13:01,240
-Cold aggravates and I feel cold in general and like warmth. I really like the sun here.

143
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:08,090
I can stay out in the sun for two-three hours, it does me well and I feel good with it.

144
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:13,510
What's also important is when I have to cough, I always lose a little bit of urine.

145
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:23,900
So these are the acute symptom and I also had some tinnitus when I had this ear thing

146
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,090
and the ear closed, I had a kind of whistling noise in it.

147
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:34,740
-The pain in the ear, what kind of pain she had? Stitching pain, tearing pain?

148
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,490
-I tried to find a word but I can not describe it, it was not tearing, not stinging.

149
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:44,940
I can't find an expression for it. What also was in the last days is,

150
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,210
on Sunday we went for a hike and afterwards I was very exhausted

151
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,440
and then I developed a feeling which comes again every now and then,

152
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,740
as if my heart was weak somehow.

153
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,170
Also with palpitations and I remember having something like that when I was 23.

154
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,240
At that time I went to the clinic repeatedly to have my heart checked

155
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,340
because I though something was wrong but everything was OK.

156
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,340
-You have some other symptoms?

157
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,750
-I often have a tired feeling in my head and around the eyes

158
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,990
but it did ameliorate after Ignatia.

159
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,330
-She took Gelsemium?
-No.

160
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,050
I frequently have to do with headaches, frontal headaches, pressing pain,

161
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:38,880
especially if I have grief and I cry, it gets really bad

162
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,130
but this also has got better after Ignatia.

163
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,980
-She has taken Nat. mur.?
-Yes.

164
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:52,080
-Did it help her? How much salt she takes?
-Very normal.

165
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:56,480
-The fat she likes?
-Not at the moment, I used to.

166
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,720
-Fruits?

167
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,980
-I didn't like them until the first dose of Ignatia, afterwards it was gone, now I like fruits.

168
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,550
-What fruits she likes best?
-Especially juicy fruits like peaches, mangos.

169
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:18,640
-No apples?
-Not so much.

170
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:29,200
I often have a restlessness of my legs which was especially bad during the toothache

171
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,440
and now I'm also restless, as I told you in the evening.

172
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,790
-She is not restless now. She tries to control it?

173
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,440
-Especially it comes when I lie in bed and try to fall asleep and the last days

174
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,660
was not only the legs but the entire body.

175
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,760
-Sweets she likes?
-Especially chocolate.

176
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,660
-What about milk?
-I don't like it.

177
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,680
-Her thirst is normal?

178
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,570
-Here I drink a lot, I'm more thirsty for cold drinks, at home when it's cold,

179
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,180
I have problems with cold drinks.

180
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,250
-Is she very sympathetic?
-Yes.

181
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,990
-How much underlines sympathetic?

182
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,990
-2-3 times. For example I read in the newspaper there is an earthquake in Turkey

183
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:23,420
and I read about a child and I cry.

184
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,580
-Nails are strong?
-Strong.

185
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,510
-She eats eggs?
-Yes, normally.

186
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,420
-Salt she use to desire very much?

187
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,660
-Actually never but the thirst is very strong and I know the symptom of unquenchable thirst

188
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,700
for ice cold drinks and at that time I received one dose of Phosphorus in LM potency

189
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,450
and after that it was gone.

190
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,040
-She did not take Aconitum?
-No.

191
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:03,280
-Now she is not afraid of dying?

192
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,810
-That's what I wanted to mention about the fear.

193
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,010
This nightmare I had a couple of days ago was about a dead body,

194
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:16,760
I was pulling out of the water and when I feel fine on the upper level

195
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:22,260
I can not really sense it but I feel it's there underneath.

196
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,750
It's like somewhere down there there is something waiting

197
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:31,260
and every once in a while a door opens and something comes up and then it's hidden again.

198
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:37,510
I repeatedly had a very strong feeling of abandonment and fear of being alone

199
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,860
and that runs through my entire life.

200
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,510
I have to say something. I think in my childhood I was a Stramonium child.

201
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:51,510
I can remember awakening every night with fear and panic and screaming

202
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,010
and I didn't even want to go to bed because I was so afraid.

203
00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:01,920
My parents coped with it for a while and then finally one night my father came and he bit me

204
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,770
until I shut up. And after that I got very closed.

205
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:15,220
This feeling of abandonment and combined with panic and fear of being alone

206
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,670
and all this is still down inside me, somewhere and I'm afraid in the dark

207
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:27,170
and I'm quite fearful of dogs and I have a strong fear of having an accident.

208
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,760
I can really imagine it, I can picture it in front of me.

209
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,270
-Has she ever taken Stramonium?

210
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:38,760
-Yes, I tried it in June after this incident with the man because I was feeling so bad

211
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:44,750
and I tried very carefully with Q potencies but I got a severe aggravation

212
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,100
and then I stopped it.

213
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,850
-Aggravation of what?
-The fears.

214
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,430
It was such a terrifying fear of abandonment and all my child memories came back

215
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,440
and they got so strong, I couldn't bear it.

216
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:07,100
And I also wanted to add that as a child I had an extreme fear of fire,

217
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,680
fear that the house would burn.

218
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,840
One other thing I wanted to mention which happened

219
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,760
after I have received Phosphorus 4 weeks ago...

220
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,010
-She took Phosphorus now lately?

221
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,010
-Yes after Opium, do you remember? After the incident.

222
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,010
-And this was the time when she had unquenchable thirst?

223
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,970
-That Phosphorus for the thirst was 9 years ago.

224
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:38,150
When I got the Phosphorus this time these feelings of guilt got very strong after Phosphorus.

225
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,150
And when these feelings of guilt got so strong after Phosphorus,

226
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,400
I also could make a connection again to my childhood days and I remember also suffering

227
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,720
from extreme feelings of guilt, as if I had done something so bad,

228
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,320
that if my parents ever find out, they would get rid of me, they would send me away.

229
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,980
-The parents are alive?

230
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,720
-My father has died and you must know I was raised very catholic

231
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,830
and the feeling was equivalent to doomed.

232
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:21,740
I have anticipatory anxiety, if something is approaching, I'm also very excited

233
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,730
and with cruel things I can not deal at all.

234
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:32,970
I can not see it in the TV either and as a child I was in a dream state most of the time,

235
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,660
I was living in a phantasy world from which nobody could get me out.

236
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,020
And this can still happen to me today, if I ride my motorbike

237
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,740
and I look at this beautiful landscape, it can really happen that instead of taking

238
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,090
the next curve, I just continue straight ahead.

239
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:55,740
And what I also wanted to say which is quite strong, if I am in company I feel much better,

240
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,090
if I'm alone I feel quite bad.

241
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,000
And I need this deep contact to people, I need real talks

242
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,100
and I also need physical contact tenderness.

243
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,990
-Sexual desire is strong?
-Yes.

244
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,320
If I have a relationship which is going well, then it's very strong.

245
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:18,100
And I'm scared quite easily.

246
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,100
-OK.

247
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:52,520
This is a really confused case, really confused.

248
00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:00,920
You don't know what to give, there is no indications at all of a possibility of a remedy

249
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:04,270
except if you go and just take a chance.

250
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,940
You can take a chance with Aconitum, which may give some effect.

251
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:20,580
The possibility of Stramonium is very strong, I'm not sure that this is not a good remedy,

252
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:27,230
I think it's a good remedy for her but maybe not at first.

253
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:39,910
The fact that Stramonium gave such strong fears it doesn't mean that the remedy is wrong.

254
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:48,070
On the contrary, because she has already a lot of fears and the mental-emotional picture

255
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:53,660
is on that level, you may see an aggravation first on that level.

256
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:58,550
We have spoken about that and this is most probably what was happening.

257
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:34,980
There is a remedy which I would have given, just for the cough but this remedy is ...

258
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:53,050
Dry tight cough and aching in left ear, that's interesting.

259
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:19,510
Worse from motion, from heat wet, cold weather, from pressure and touch.

260
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,020
I found out that this remedy when somebody is having a fright

261
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,740
after seeing a dead person suddenly.

262
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,250
One of the remedies is Guaiacum.

263
00:24:53,160 --> 00:25:03,310
But all these remedies that you can think, Phosphorus is a possibility but she took and...

264
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:08,070
The best reaction for me, from what she described from the remedies,

265
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:20,660
the best reaction she had was from Stramonium. What potency of Stramonium did you take?

266
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:26,410
-LM.
-High or low?

267
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:39,160
-Q1 for 1 week and Q2 also for 1 week once the day.

268
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:43,080
-And the reaction when it started?

269
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:49,580
-Immediately, even while I was taking it I found that psychologically I went down.

270
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,580
-If you touch the bottom, then you go up.

271
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,570
-I have to add something. I know you have these initials aggravations

272
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:09,990
after taking a remedy and I know it can be bad but this one was so severe, it was very bad.

273
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:18,970
Maybe after the Q2 I did feel stable for a while but then I also had problems

274
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:23,400
with my boyfriend and the relationship ended and then I felt bad again.

275
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:35,110
-When in time, when did she take the Stramonium?
-In June.

276
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,200
-Did she have the cough by that time?
-No.

277
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,700
-In time when the fright was with the boy who drowned?

278
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,020
-That was in the beginning of August.

279
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:13,370
-It means 1 month ago?
-Yes. It happened on the 7th of August.

280
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,750
-She does not have the look of Stramonium. This is not the look of Stramonium.

281
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:40,910
This is the look of somebody which something happened and has become weak

282
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:46,010
because of that fright and that has remained inside all the time.

283
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:55,080
It's not the fear, the fright but somebody who has been frightened ...

284
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,340
That's why I thought of Guaiacum.

285
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:10,480
I would suggest first you take a dose of Guaiacum just for the cough to see what happens

286
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:24,250
and the pain, you just take 1,2 doses of Guaiacum 200, then try Aconitum

287
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:34,920
and if this does not work then most probably you have to try one dose of Stramonium 200.

288
00:28:48,170 --> 00:29:00,230
You have to understand the idea of aggravation, especially with the fears,

289
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:07,980
is the idea of facing fears. You can not always keep the fears under control

290
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,670
and under the conscious in a sub-conscious level.

291
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:21,310
-I'd like to know how long I should wait for one remedy to act before I try the next.

292
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:26,920
-With Guaiacum in 1 week you should have an effect.

293
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:35,150
That means if you see a big aggravation then you can wait longer, in the cough.

294
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:39,570
So you may be coughing for a few days and to start coming out with sputum.

295
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:45,650
What I see that the bronchi are affected already and you have a difficulty

296
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:51,250
in breathing really, that's what I see.

297
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:59,750
That means there must be a kind of inflammation to take out the problem.

298
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,250
So if you get an aggravation, it's OK.

299
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:14,080
If you get an amelioration immediate of the cough, that means is not a good idea.

300
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,400
That means it's acted superficially and most probably the cough will come back

301
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,500
in one week or 10 days, you will have back the cough.

302
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:36,570
If you get a mental aggravation together with an aggravation of the cough,

303
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:39,920
this is the best. Then you wait for a long time.

304
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,810
But in any case, your case you have to be careful

305
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:59,840
because you can confuse the case totally and nobody will be able to do anything, anymore.

306
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:12,870
-George I'm confused.
-You are not the only one.

307
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:19,480
-If her case can be easily mixed up, why...

308
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:25,640
-Because we see the remedies they have an effect upon her quite strong.

309
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:32,810
She takes Phosphorus, the thirst is going away, she takes again Phosphorus all the fears,

310
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,890
she takes Stramonium the fears...

311
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:40,380
That means the organism is easily affected by homeopathic remedy.

312
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,650
Such individual should be careful not to use too many remedies.

313
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,560
-So why you prescribe 3 in a row?

314
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:53,550
-No, I'm not prescribing 3 in a row. You made a mistake.

315
00:31:53,650 --> 00:32:00,650
I prescribed one, if there is no effect, then you prescribe the second.

316
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,410
I give some ideas, I don't prescribe.

317
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,550
Actually she knows what to do when the symptoms come,

318
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:19,060
most probably she will take another remedy all together or maybe after Guaiacum

319
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,280
she develops a clear case of Bryonia.

320
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:30,820
She takes Bryonia and she is OK, it doesn't have to be the remedies sequence...

321
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:38,470
Maybe she takes Guaiacum and then the fear of dark becomes intolerant,

322
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:43,360
that is the time she takes Stramonium. Maybe she takes Guaiacum

323
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,810
and the fear of death becomes too strong,

324
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,650
I'm going to die in 2-3 weeks I'm going to die, then Aconitum.
