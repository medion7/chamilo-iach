1
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:32,830
-You can give us a follow up what happened after Ignatia 50M and CM you took last October?

2
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:40,590
-In the middle of October last year I took 3 times 50M and twice CM Ignatia.

3
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:46,620
About 3 days later I had the first reaction which was very heavy perspiration at night.

4
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:54,480
This sweating in the night which was very warm and not exhausting was going on for about 1 week.

5
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,380
Afterwards with a break of about 1 week, a sleeplessness developed.

6
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,120
The sleeplessness was such that I could fall asleep very well but I could wake about

7
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:16,720
1 or 2 hours later and then stay awake for 1 hour, sleep for 1/2 an hour, wake for 1 hour...

8
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:23,880
During this period of sleeplessness I developed an anxiety to what would come up to me

9
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,120
the next day, the events of the next day.

10
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,130
This state was going on for about 10-14 days and I was very tired throughout the day.

11
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:42,290
I had quite some problems to manage my daily affairs and to continue to do my office,

12
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,590
my practices.

13
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,490
During this time I was still smoking about 8-10 cigarettes per day.

14
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:58,810
It was quite difficult for me to manage without taking any coffee or any other things but I managed

15
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,960
After this period of sleeplessness was going on for about 10-14 days, it was practically

16
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,560
sleepless on 1 week I practically slept through, without any breaks.

17
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,540
-Day and night?

18
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:29,540
-Yes. And then this sleeplessness was over but 1 month later I developed a bronchitis.

19
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:41,890
This bronchitis was very painful, the fever would go up to 38.5 and would go on for about 10 days.

20
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,810
-You took no medication?

21
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:57,890
-No, I just put warm applications on my breast and that was the main thing. And that did me good.

22
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:04,040
About 8 days following this bronchitis, I was pretty warn out and couldn't go to work in my practices.

23
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:08,380
Then for 1 month I could do my practices without any difficulty and

24
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,380
then I got the next bronchitis and that was at the end of December, beginning January

25
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,800
and that was going on with about the same attitude like the first one.

26
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,400
I didn't do any treatment again and I have to close my practices again about 14 days.

27
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:36,370
-The bronchitis was, according to him, something stronger in the past he has experienced?

28
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,850
-I never really had bronchitis in my life. I only twice had lung infections and one was when

29
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:51,100
I was 16, I had a pneumonia and later on 1 bronchitis and that was all. Otherwise no bronchitis.

30
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:58,500
Then another month would pass by and I got my third bronchitis. Then this bronchitis

31
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,930
was very heavy, I had a hard time recovering from this bronchitis, I was very tired

32
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,600
dull in my mind, had difficulties to think.

33
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,100
-Nobody took down his symptom during that time?

34
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:20,850
-No. After that I had such a hard time to recover, I repeated in the beginning of March

35
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:28,850
50M of Ignatia. Then I recovered pretty soon, I realized that the energy was coming back.

36
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:38,180
And after this I did a hiking and fasting tour with some other people for 10 days.

37
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:46,600
This was very good for me again and after this third bronchitis I stopped smoking.

38
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:52,850
It was the first time in my life that I had the strength to stand through, work in my

39
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,030
practices and giving up smoking, without any relapse.

40
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,680
The main problem why I started smoking and why I was smoking in my past, was this

41
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:10,680
incredible pressure on my chest from the outside as well and from the inside.

42
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:17,850
And this nagging emptiness with an incredible feeling of hunger in my stomach.

43
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:27,850
And these symptoms got aggravated with a certain emotional stress situation and by

44
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,450
smoking I somehow could keep it low.

45
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:38,520
I may say so that the first remarkable improvement is that this blockage of openness

46
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,210
is starting to loosen up.

47
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:51,830
-He means in the chest?
-No, all together, mentally and emotionally.

48
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:59,610
-He felt more free?
-Yes.

49
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,950
-How is the emptiness in the stomach now?

50
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,700
-This emptiness is not very pronounced for the time being but for the time being I'm not

51
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,200
under strong emotional stress either.

52
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,700
I want to add something. When I now came to Alonissos I took a package of green tea with me

53
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:26,610
and I would take that as a substitute for the black tea and I prepared it for myself

54
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:34,960
and I realized that my energy would get low after drinking the green tea.

55
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,440
And when I left it out about 2 days ago I realized that my energy is increasing again.

56
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:54,440
I just want to bring into discussion that green tea might diminish

57
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:03,260
 the reaction of the homeopathic remedy.

58
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,010
-When he says green tea is of a special herb?
-We have the green tea and the normal tea.

59
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,760
-The normal tea is the black tea?
-Yes.

60
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,510
-And the green tea is one herb.

61
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:23,760
-The green tea is not fermented, if you take the green leaves and not fermented.

62
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,610
-It's the same.

63
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:41,440
-I asked some people and found out the caffeine content is higher in the green tea.

64
00:07:43,440 --> 00:08:00,760
-I want to ask him some questions.
He had an aversion to butter milk, is it still there?

65
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,930
-Yes, still there.
-The desire for fish?

66
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,780
-Still good.

67
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,190
-Is any change in his desires and aversions? He eats more fruits now?

68
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,940
-I eat some more fruits in the moment.
-Salt?

69
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:27,170
-Hardly but I never ate any salt to my meals.

70
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:36,430
-If he can give me a general overall view for his present state at the moment, he would I'm satisfied

71
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:43,460
or there are certain things that he would like to improve further?

72
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,460
-The important point is what I've been describing before. There is this inner pressure.

73
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,710
-The pressure in the chest which continues?

74
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,210
-It's still there but for the moment I feel so strong that even though I do my practices

75
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,460
I can fight against, I can deal with it. But it's still there without smoking.

76
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:18,960
-Still a desire to take a deep breath? This pressure is physical or emotional?

77
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,810
-In my opinion is more emotional.

78
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,660
-But he says it comes from outside and from inside also.

79
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,380
-It comes from outside and at the same time is from inside.

80
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,740
The bad part about it is that it blocks me in my thinking.

81
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:00,860
-His energy level how much he would put it at the moment?

82
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,360
-Do you mean my level of sickness or energy?
-Energy.

83
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,480
-I think energy is about half of what I feel inside.

84
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:16,860
The problem is that I feel a lot of energy inside but my physical body doesn't come

85
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,960
along with my energy and my creativity.

86
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:36,820
-When he took the last dose on March 50M, he felt an immediate effect from the remedy?

87
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:45,570
-It took about 3-4 days.
-His sleep now is good?

88
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:52,990
-I have no problems falling asleep but then I wake around 4-5 o'clock in the morning.

89
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:02,710
-And that was before or now it's a new?
-That stayed the same.

90
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:12,170
-Always 4-5 o'clock in the morning and he has to go for stool when he wakes up at that time?

91
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:17,670
-Not at that time immediately but often enough at 5.30 in the morning I have an urge to go for stool

92
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:27,230
and for years it's been the first thing in the morning that I go and have my stool.

93
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:34,560
-The temperature of the body has changed at all? Became more warm, less warm?

94
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:41,170
-Not really but like I said before heat I can't tolerate very well.

95
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,320
-There is any special desire for sweets?

96
00:11:51,420 --> 00:12:00,040
-I like sweets and it may happen that I eat a whole block of chocolate in one occasion.

97
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:07,920
And without any problems after having eaten a whole chocolate, I can eat something sour.

98
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:16,290
-Still did he try the vertigo high places? Did he have an opportunity to see whether it

99
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,790
still is there the vertigo of high places?

100
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:23,790
-I realized that this vertigo of high places got a little bit worse.

101
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,640
I realized it when I was at home and I had to repair my roof.

102
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:38,990
That was very uncomfortable for me.
-Very good.

103
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:05,220
The remedy is correct, has acted correctly for several reasons. You know now

104
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:20,130
you understand the upper 3 level how it goes to level 2. It was upper 3 goes straight

105
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:27,630
away to 2 with 1 month, acutes are severe.

106
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:33,630
Now whether we treat this acute or not, it is of great importance.

107
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:43,380
This acute, if it had a clear picture, it could be treated and should be treated.

108
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,720
Then the organism would feel even more relieved.

109
00:13:52,470 --> 00:14:01,370
If the picture was not clear but the bronchitis or the pneumonia which he may develop later on

110
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:10,780
is threatening, is severe, then we repeat the original remedy.

111
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,280
If the symptomatology is not clear.

112
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,930
In his case we are in a crossroad. Which is the crossroad?

113
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:33,350
The remedy has done certain things. We are eager to take his case further.

114
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:41,850
And usually that is the time when we jump into the picture by giving another remedy.

115
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,850
Which is the other remedy that we give in this case?

116
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,050
-Sulphur.

117
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,510
-You see how good you become, very good, Sulphur.

118
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,760
The remedy becomes clearer and clearer, would you give it?

119
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,460
-Yes.
-No.

120
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:10,450
-OK, who would give it? Who would not give it? What you will do?

121
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,950
You don't give it, that's correct. You don't give it at the moment, you have it in mind.

122
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:21,970
This is a case where Sulphur symptoms are developing, you have it in mind and then

123
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:29,050
you say, wait I want something more. What more you want?

124
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,960
An even clearer symptom of Sulphur. What is it?

125
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,950
-Feet out of covers.

126
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:45,320
-Very good. Simple things like that will save your life and mostly the life of the patient.

127
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:53,120
In this case, where you are already thinking of Sulphur, you have a keynote of Sulphur

128
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:57,330
certain moment is very strong, then you go ahead, you can give it.

129
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:07,790
In the meantime what you do? This case need more repetition of the Ignatia until he treats it more

130
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:14,240
because we still see symptoms of Ignatia and we see symptoms  of Sulphur, as well.

131
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,890
Ignatia has affected this case quite strongly, quite good.

132
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:23,590
What was the best thing you hear about this case?

133
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,020
It is sleeping for 1 week. This is beautiful.

134
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:39,260
-One weekend.
-OK I heard one week. I said my god!

135
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:49,760
I had a case with Aurum. He slept for 20 days and nights.

136
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,510
He got up, eat etc. and then fall back again and again and again.

137
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:02,920
He had to give up his job totally. During 20 days and then the whole thing recovered.

138
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:10,090
That's why when I mentioned in the middle reactions fever and sleepiness is a very

139
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:15,690
good sign to know your remedy is acting beautifully. Wait.

140
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,590
It's very interesting now he stopped smoking also why?

141
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:34,420
Because he is more strong but yet Ignatia we know has an aversion to smoking.

142
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Maybe that helped him a little bit to quit smoking.

143
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:47,950
Therefore the course of action is whenever you think the organism is going down repeat,

144
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:54,200
since himself is a homeopath, the Ignatia. One course of action.

145
00:17:54,300 --> 00:18:01,950
The other course of action could be giving 12 every day for a period of time.

146
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:11,700
See whether this slow action of Ignatia could slowly improve the situation.

147
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:19,950
You can start by taking twice the day and if there is an aggravation, you stop.

148
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:28,700
If you may see a continuous improvement, you continue and then you go to once a day.

149
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,450
After 20 days, you can go to once the day.

150
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:40,960
And as long as there is, even slight improvement, you continue especially if you can raise

151
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:48,450
the potency every 10 days, you raise the potency. 12,14,15 etc.

152
00:18:48,550 --> 00:19:02,800
These are new things, I'm just giving you my experience and don't be surprised.

153
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,810
I think this is enough.
