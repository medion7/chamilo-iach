1
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,140
-How old is the patient?
-She is 18 years old.

2
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:38,800
-You have been treating this case before?
-Yes but not just me.

3
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:47,130
-Other homeopaths as well.
-First other homeopaths and allopaths too.

4
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,420
-Can you fist give us your perspective of the case?

5
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:03,610
-In February 1997 she started having a ulcerative colitis.

6
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,930
After the first spell she went down on her weight to 42 kilos.

7
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,100
Because she was living in my neighborhood I recommended that she would see a homeopath.

8
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,750
At that time she got Ignatia and Nat mur without any success,

9
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,750
she was having relapse after relapse and then she had a real bad relapse

10
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,580
when the homeopath was on holidays and even though

11
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,580
she was getting high doses of cortisone, she was getting 15 mg of cortisone every day,

12
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,070
there was no amelioration and she was threatened that she would have to go to a hospital.

13
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,790
That would have been the third stay in hospital.

14
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,900
-She has been hospitalized another 2 times.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,820
-So I said you are doing so bad even though you are taking cortisone,

16
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,000
so immediately you have to stop cortisone and we just search for the right remedy.

17
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,560
So first I gave you Aurum and I waited for 3 days and there was no success

18
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,070
and then she got Mercury.

19
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,320
-Which Mercury, solubilis?

20
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,010
-Yes Mercury Solubilis and the next day the symptoms were much better already.

21
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,420
-What potency?
-Q1.

22
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,070
Nevertheless 3 days later she went to hospital because everything

23
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:32,390
had been initiated before and she got again 15 mg of cortisone every day

24
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,890
and then she had diarrhea again.

25
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:41,640
4 weeks after she had the Q1 Mercury Solubilis the diarrhea started all over again.

26
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:47,230
Then I told her to take it twice the day, the Q1. 3-4 weeks later it started again,

27
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:53,310
so I gave her the Q4 and a month later it started again with the diarrhea,

28
00:02:53,410 --> 00:03:00,060
so I decided to give her C30 and I gave it 3 times because there was no reaction

29
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,310
after the first dose.

30
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,880
Then she was again better for about 3-4 weeks, then it got worse again,

31
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,830
so I decided to give the C200 and no reaction.

32
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,730
-Is she taking cortisone at the moment?

33
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:31,240
-Since Thursday she stopped cortisone. 4 days.

34
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:42,550
-Give her now you mic and ask her what are the symptoms at the moment.

35
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,900
-For the time being no symptoms at all, everything is OK.

36
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,560
-So she does not take cortisone and she is free of symptoms.

37
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,570
-No cortisone orally but she takes clisma [enema] with cortisone.

38
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,130
-With bismuth together? Usually they give cortisone with bismuth together.

39
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,240
-Yes.

40
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:18,060
-She is 18 and by the time the ulcerative colitis started she was almost 16 years old.

41
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,420
What happened?

42
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,650
-She doesn't want to tell in front of the camera.

43
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:30,510
-Oh she doesn't want. Not this camera or this camera?

44
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,510
-This from television.

45
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:48,920
-OK you stop the camera, so you can continue.

46
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:54,930
-At that time I had my first boyfriend and my first sexual contact

47
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,160
and that friendship ended when he was going to America for a year

48
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,240
and that was when first the diarrhea started.

49
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:07,740
-How long after the boy left?
-The first week after he left.

50
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,490
-And before she never had any problems with her guts?

51
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,910
-Just when I was sort of excited.

52
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,660
-When she was excited she would get diarrhea?
-Yes.

53
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:27,670
-Before an examination for instance?
-Yes.

54
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,230
-Before the examination you would have to run 1 or 2 times?

55
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,840
-Once.

56
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,920
-And it was like diarrhea?
-Yes.

57
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,320
-And before that you got sick with something else? Do you remember?

58
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,170
-No, nothing.

59
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,510
-You did not have antibiotics?

60
00:05:53,260 --> 00:06:03,670
-Yes when I had a cold I got antibiotics. Not very often.

61
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,820
-How many times?
-2-3 times.

62
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:19,540
-When she took antibiotics did she have diarrhea after? And what else she had?

63
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:27,840
-Rubella, measles and chicken pox.

64
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,980
-Tell me something else. How long you had contact with this boy?

65
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,830
-Half a year.

66
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:46,640
-Did she have any cystitis immediately after she started having sex?

67
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,250
-No.

68
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,520
-Did she understand what is cystitis?
-Yes.

69
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:08,070
-Did she have menses normal?

70
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:16,160
-When this boyfriend left the menses stopped for 1 year.

71
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:27,340
-What did you feel?
-I felt lonely, not understood.

72
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:37,740
-She thinks that the boy left for America because he did not love her?

73
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,530
-Yes, somehow yes.

74
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,570
-That's what she thought.

75
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,330
-Did she try to write or talk to him?

76
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:50,330
-We wrote quite often or telephoned but finally I terminated the relationship.

77
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,570
-Because it was painful?

78
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,430
-I thought the normal feelings left after this time, after half a year.

79
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:08,380
-What did she feel in her feelings? She felt that her emotions went down,

80
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,300
less and less emotions until she felt cold inside?

81
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,390
-Yes. When I didn't see him.

82
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,900
-In the beginning she was thinking of committing suicide?

83
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,810
-Not in that time.

84
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,210
-When?
-Recently yes.

85
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:35,150
-Recently she is thinking. How recently?
-Half a year ago.

86
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,630
-She feels depressed?
-Sometimes.

87
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:51,480
-Does she feel she has emotions now?
-Yes, I do have feelings.

88
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,050
-She has brother, sister?
-One sister.

89
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,570
-She has now another boyfriend?
-No.

90
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,910
-She does not want to have one?
-Not for the time being.

91
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,540
-Why?
-For the moment I feel better being alone.

92
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,600
-She is afraid she will be hurt?
-This too.

93
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,700
-Whom she loves most? Her mother, father, sister?
-My mother.

94
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,500
-The relationship with her father is good?
-Not so much.

95
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,670
-He hits her?
-No.

96
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,340
-Shouts?
-Yes.

97
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,430
-And she is afraid?
-Yes.

98
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,470
-Her emotions for her mother are strong?
-Yes.

99
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:54,920
-So she says she is thinking of committing suicide and at the same time

100
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:01,010
she loves her mother, how does she thinks about these 2 matters?

101
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,750
-For the time being I don't think of committing suicide but then

102
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,350
when I thought about it I was not getting along so well with my mother either.

103
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,570
-Why? Because of this incident with the boyfriend?

104
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,430
-No, it had nothing to do with this.

105
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:34,070
-She has a lot of blood in the stool?
-Yes during the spell a lot of blood.

106
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,510
-The blood is red or blackish?
-Red.

107
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,260
-Is she very thirsty?
-No.

108
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:54,510
-In her body is she feeling very warm or cold?
-Warm.

109
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
-She has any fears?

110
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:12,270
-Darkness, to talk in front of public, I'm afraid to embarrass myself,

111
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,930
afraid of examinations and spiders.

112
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,160
-She it intolerant of heat?
-No I tolerate heat pretty well.

113
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,150
-Cold?
-Not so much.

114
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,490
-Because you said before she can not tolerate heat.

115
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,740
-Yes, heat I can tolerate very well.

116
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,100
-She likes heat but she does not like cold.
-No.

117
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:06,250
-What kind of food she takes? She is careful with her diet or she takes any kind of food?

118
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,960
-She is careful what she eats.

119
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,250
-What she likes to eat?

120
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:29,090
-Fruits, vegetables, noodles and sweets too.

121
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:39,490
-And she can eat vegetables and fruits or this aggravates her?

122
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:47,740
-Vegetables I can eat anything but for fruits I have to avoid oranges and lemons.

123
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,250
-She likes oranges?
-Yes.

124
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:59,920
-What fruits she likes best?
-Apples and strawberries.

125
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,820
-Her mother or father do they suffer with similar problems?

126
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,170
-No, her hands are trembling.

127
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:24,670
-Show me.
-When she is excited it is much worse.

128
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:31,070
-Now she is not excited?
-Yes, but I don't really understand.

129
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,070
-How she can keep so calm?
-Yes.

130
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,960
-Her thyroid has been examined?
-No.

131
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,010
-Do like this and then swallow.

132
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,740
Now she has menses? Her period is back?

133
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:09,100
-It came back after 1 year but since the last spell of the colitis it has been gone again.

134
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,490
-When she had menses, before menses, a day before, 2 days before

135
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:23,990
she was feeling OK or she was feeling depressed, anxious, irritable?

136
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,840
-Totally normal.

137
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:33,350
-And she had many days of blood or only 2-3 days?

138
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,200
-5-6 days.

139
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:47,000
-How much water she drinks?
-About 1 1/2 lit per day.

140
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,710
-It has to be cold the water, from the refrigerator?
-Yes.

141
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,850
-She likes ice cream a lot?
-Yes.

142
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,460
-How many ice creams she can take the day?
-One at most.

143
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,950
-How much salt she uses?
-Very little.

144
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,040
-You don't like salt?
-No.

145
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:26,440
-She must be careful in her answers, to answer if she does not remember to say

146
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:33,610
I don't remember, if she needs to think, stop and think it's better than just giving us

147
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:40,110
the wrong information or if I ask her a question that she does not want to answer,

148
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:47,130
she can say I don't want to answer. Since when this trembling is?

149
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:53,360
-Since I can remember. I've known her for 10 years and for 10 years

150
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,280
she had been having this trembling.

151
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,620
-Only on the hands. Not the feet?
-No.

152
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:16,790
-And if you take this, hold this, if she takes a cup to drink she is trembling?

153
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,620
-No.

154
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,970
-Only if you are excited?
-Yes mainly.

155
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,370
-And the excitement is when she is in front of boys?

156
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:33,300
-Too but too at school.
-When the teacher tells her to come up.

157
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,950
-You are good student?
-Yes.

158
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:44,050
-Very good?
-Very good. She is very ambitious.

159
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,160
-She wants to be first in the class.
-Yes.

160
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,790
-Are you first in your class?

161
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:04,120
-Not for the time being because I had to redouble the year because

162
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,030
I was so much absent.

163
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:14,740
-Her nails are strong or brittle?
-Very brittle.

164
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:24,160
-But does she bite the nails?
-When I'm excited yes.

165
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,040
-Does she ever stammer?
-No.

166
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:36,270
The last 2 spells of colitis appeared when she was having a lot of examinations

167
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,120
at school and too when she was doing the driving license.

168
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,020
-Can she describe her character?

169
00:17:52,120 --> 00:18:05,880
-Benevolent, loves animals more than people.

170
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,270
-She was loving these animals before or after the incident?

171
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,120
-Always.

172
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,370
-Which animals? Dogs?
-Dogs and horses.

173
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,870
-She is very fastidious? Very organized with her things?

174
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,920
-No, on the contrary.

175
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,810
-She throws things around?

176
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:43,530
-She is good friend with the niece of mine and in comparison with this niece

177
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,870
she is 100 times better.

178
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,770
What is remarkable about her is that she is very much looking for harmony

179
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:57,770
and very peaceful and she doesn't like struggles or fights

180
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:05,370
and she is always evening up the situations, equilibring.

181
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:18,600
-Peace maker. But according to her does she get anger inside?

182
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,060
-Yes.

183
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,860
-And then what she does? She keeps the anger and she holds the anger inside?

184
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,460
-She keeps it inside.

185
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,610
-She never expressed her anger?
-Never.

186
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:41,270
-This is a good job.
-At most towards my father but...

187
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,800
-But also with others.

188
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,300
She sleeps OK?
-Yes.

189
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,880
-Her feet in bed are cold or warm?
-Cold.

190
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:04,860
-There is any perspiration during sleep? Her nails actually brake easily

191
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,700
and she bites them?
-Yes both.

192
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:21,710
-Her toe nail maybe enters into the flesh?
-No, once but otherwise not.

193
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,610
-Does she ever have any perspiration?
-After doing sports.

194
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:34,110
-When she perspires she feels good or with perspiration she feels bad?

195
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:42,190
-Uneasy, dirty, when she is sweating she feels dirty.

196
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,920
-The perspiration is offensive?

197
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:52,620
-No. Not agreeable but it's not offensive.

198
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,860
-I will ask her now a difficult question but she can answer or not answer.

199
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:09,760
Sexually how she feels now? It doesn't matter, don't answer, you will tell me later.

200
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,590
-No desire.

201
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:19,930
-At all.
-Not for sexual things.

202
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,100
-She feels an aversion?
-For the time being yes.

203
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:34,350
-Does she have leucorrhea instead of menses, does she have discharge from the vagina?

204
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,180
-No.

205
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,690
-The vagina is dry?
-Yes.

206
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:14,590
-If she is in a situation, for instance on a queue waiting and somebody goes

207
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:21,090
and sit in front of her, will she tell him sir go back?

208
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,190
-She wouldn't say anything.

209
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:33,420
-If she is in a state where it needs confrontation with somebody, she will keep her anger

210
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,810
and then she will go away from this confrontation and maybe she will be trembling?

211
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:49,320
-It depends on whom it is. If I would know somebody very well, I would tell him my opinion,

212
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,170
but very reduced.

213
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,500
-She is afraid of dark very much?
-When I'm alone yes.

214
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,650
-In the house at night when she is alone, she would be afraid?

215
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:27,000
-If something would move or something would made noise, I would be afraid.

216
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,170
-Does she feel she has a lot of gas inside her abdomen?

217
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,750
The abdomen bloats?
-Yes.

218
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:46,150
-And then she has a lot of gas?
-Yes.

219
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,890
-What about burping?
-Too.

220
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:59,910
-A lot?
-No, rather gas, flatulence.

221
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:08,310
-Does she also hear the abdomen rumbling?
-Yes.

222
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:21,620
-When in the morning, when she wakes up, she feels tired or she wakes up

223
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,430
and she is ready to go?
-Tired, very tired.

224
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:34,140
-Even if she sleeps 8-9 hours?
-Yes.

225
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,040
-And how long it takes to come back?

226
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:47,890
-During the whole day I'm tired. It reduces a little bit but I'm not totally fit.

227
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,220
Since the colitis, the illness is gone no.

228
00:24:55,220 --> 00:25:03,710
-What is her best time? When she feels best?
-Afternoon and evening?

229
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,890
-In hours?
-From 3 pm to midnight.

230
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,390
-And which is the worse time?
-In the morning between 6 and 10 o'clock.

231
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,040
-Sweets she likes very much?
-Every now and then yes.

232
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,630
-She takes sweets?
-Yes.

233
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:37,050
-That means not every day.
-Just every now and then, not every day.

234
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:48,980
-Because she is aggravated by sweets or because she does not care?

235
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,560
-Because they aggravate.

236
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,960
-Does she take raw onion in the salad?

237
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:27,950
-No. Since the illness has been diagnosed, no.

238
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:34,300
-Why? What happens?
-The flatulence is much more.

239
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:44,550
-That's why she avoids. In general if she eats onion, she will feel bad?

240
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,890
-Just the gas is worse.

241
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:52,370
-She likes onions?
-No, neither.

242
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,470
-What about oysters.
-I have never eaten them.

243
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,450
-Why?

244
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:04,480
-I don't like them and just the aspect I don't like them.

245
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:17,870
-She says that if the teacher calls her to tell the lesson, she feels very anxious, right?

246
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,870
-That's true.

247
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,880
-Why? Does she know why?

248
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:28,390
-I'm just afraid to embarrass myself, to put myself in awkward situation.

249
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,790
-Why, she does not know the answer?

250
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:40,050
-This too. It has been in the foreground been in the center of attention.

251
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:55,290
-If she has to go to some Authorities, to some work, she will do it easily

252
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,990
or she will also be afraid?

253
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,060
-That will be difficult.

254
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:11,230
-In bed she takes a position to sleep?

255
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,940
She likes to sleep on the right side, on the left side, on the abdomen, on back?

256
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,380
-On my abdomen and on the side.

257
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:26,360
-Both sides and abdomen. She likes to swim in the sea?

258
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,360
-Yes, very much.

259
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,610
-But is it possible when she is in the sea, for instance last summer,

260
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:41,460
when she was suffering with colitis, if she goes to the sea she will feel good?

261
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,050
-Last year she wasn't at the sea shore.

262
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:04,950
She is just saying that she had to give her dog an injection so that he would die

263
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:12,880
and they did it together both of them and consolation aggravates.

264
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:22,280
-She likes the sun when she goes to the sea, she will lie in the sun or she avoids.

265
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,880
-She lies in the sun.

266
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:35,000
-And no other fear? Except of darkness, being embarrassed and spiders she has no other fears?

267
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,550
-Examinations.

268
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:47,200
-In the darkness sometimes she feels that they are presents like ghosts?

269
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:53,200
-No. Before the colitis started she was having recurrent herpes.

270
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:58,300
Once right on the nose and on the lips and it was coming like once the month.

271
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:05,230
-Before the colitis, that means during the time she had the affair with the boy?

272
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,130
-Before this.

273
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:15,110
-Herpes in the nose?
-On the tip of the nose.

274
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:28,220
-And then she had also other skin eruption?
-Little abscesses?

275
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,680
-Where?
-On the legs and the arms.

276
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,430
-She never had the acne?
-No.

277
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,430
-And she puts some cream here in the nose?

278
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:47,270
-No, nothing. I got a remedy from him and that worked.

279
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,530
-Mercury.

280
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:59,090
-It worked for the herpes on the lips but it didn't work for the herpes on the nose.

281
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,780
And she had it for about 2 weeks.

282
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:11,280
-Do you have any problems with your teeth?
-No.

283
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:18,770
-She has written any other things in her notes which we didn't ask?

284
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:21,770
-Everything that I have written down yes.

285
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:29,200
-We have asked. Very good.

286
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:56,100
-I would like to add something which definitely I would not have said here

287
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,070
in front of the auditorium and I also needed a long time to find out about this

288
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,410
and I think it might be important.

289
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:12,650
I kept repeating the question since the colitis started after this unhappy love affair

290
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:22,810
whether she is still very attached to this issue and finally she broke out into tears

291
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:30,570
and said no, what is much worse is my mother had told me that if I also would move out from home,

292
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,660
she would kill herself.

293
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:39,140
And I think this is very important point for the occurring of the colitis which she,

294
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,330
herself can not say.

295
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:57,920
-So her mother has actually blackmailed her, if she goes out, I will commit suicide.

296
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:16,730
-You said that the mother said, if you also would move out, so does that

297
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,980
mean somebody else has already moved out of the house? The father or the sister

298
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,090
or maybe somebody else?

299
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,840
-Shortly before her sister had moved out.

300
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:47,310
-I just want to ask you as a first impression you have.

301
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:53,670
Which group you would place her from these?

302
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:11,280
-The second group.

303
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:23,020
-Who says 3? Who says second?

304
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:32,810
She is really on the lower second or the beginning of 3.

305
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:41,940
That is the idea. You can not say this is, no.

306
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:52,930
That is the idea, you are getting the idea of what you have to deal with.

307
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:19,670
Why we say that? Because of pathology and because of another reason also.

308
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:25,670
What is the second reason that we say she belongs somewhere here?

309
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,670
-The high doses of cortisone she took?

310
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,940
-Not exactly.

311
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:43,450
-The thinking of committing suicide.

312
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:51,950
-She gives many pictures of different remedies.

313
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:10,430
-That means her remedy is not clear. The pathology is quite strong and at the same time

314
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:19,430
the general state is not good at all. When she stays without cortisone, she may go...

315
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:25,090
You see her like this now but if you take away the cortisone,

316
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,600
you may see a totally different picture.

317
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,520
In one month you may see her lying in bed totally exhausted.

318
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:48,760
So for all these reasons we say that this case belongs to the beginning of the third group

319
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,430
to the end of the second.

320
00:36:55,180 --> 00:37:07,680
We have to deal with a case most probably that will not be well with one remedy.

321
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:14,430
We have to give most probably a second remedy or repeating the remedy etc.

322
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:20,010
What is the special difficulty that we have with this case?

323
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:43,340
The fact that she gets these cortisone enemas and something else also that you have to have in mind.

324
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:52,080
Now she takes cortisone enemas and she feels quite good for I don't know how many days

325
00:37:54,020 --> 00:38:01,920
but if she continues like that, only with cortisone enemas, there is going to be a time

326
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:07,670
where these cortisone enemas will not be sufficient and she will start having a relapse,

327
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:16,490
she will be hospitalized again. The fact that she remains better is most probably because

328
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:24,090
she has been ameliorated by the remedies she took so far.

329
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:35,870
And the question that we have to ask is whether... She took Ignatia, she took Nat mur

330
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:43,250
and she took also Mercury and Aurum.

331
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,570
As far as I understand she did not take more remedies than that.

332
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:55,630
-And Carcinosin.
-Carcinosin also.

333
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:06,120
So all these remedies it might have an effect on her case, maybe not a curative effect

334
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:20,920
but still they might have made the colitis less severe. Why I say that?

335
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:29,820
If the remedy is not curing how do I say and why do I say that in spite of

336
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:38,420
not having the correct remedy, still she may have been ameliorated in her colitis?

337
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,090
Can anybody tell me?

338
00:39:54,120 --> 00:40:02,430
She said 6 months after this separation and the colitis going on,

339
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:06,280
she started having suicidal thoughts.

340
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:18,850
During that time we can say that the colitis most probably will be better.

341
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:26,340
Because some of the impact of the disease it goes to the psychological level

342
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:39,680
and the force of the disturbance is distributed to some emotional and then the physical.

343
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:53,270
When you see that it is like you have an amount of disease.

344
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:00,420
If the whole amount goes to one place, it's very strong.

345
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:08,170
But if this amount you distribute in different levels, then the local level,

346
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:12,190
the physical level can be ameliorated.

347
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:23,010
And this is something which may come from the effect of the remedies or from the conflict

348
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,150
she has with her mother.

349
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:45,180
The difficulty in this case is we have to work with this case while she is under cortisone.

350
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,170
This is very difficult always because by the time you take away the cortisone,

351
00:41:51,270 --> 00:42:00,430
you may see a totally different picture but under the circumstances OK we have to work now

352
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:07,430
with these conditions and we'll try to see if we can make out what is

353
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:10,770
the most probable remedy for her.

354
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:23,940
I would like you to comment on the taking of the case.

355
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:28,350
The taking of the case was good enough for you?

356
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:37,010
Do we cover all the areas or you feel you want some more information?

357
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,860
You would ask something else?

358
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:56,090
-I would like to have some more information on symptoms to the disease,

359
00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,440
the ulcerative colitis; maybe how is the stool and so on.

360
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:15,520
-This is a correct observation. I did not pay much attention to the quality of the stool,

361
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:22,910
the pains that she may had, only the amount of blood I was interested about.

362
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:28,350
So this was an omission on my part.

363
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:37,980
Whether this omission is important or not, maybe it's a matter of debate

364
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:41,540
but there was an omission, yes.

365
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:51,760
-I didn't feel that I got to know her enough, like she didn't talk about her dreams

366
00:43:54,610 --> 00:44:01,610
and also hobbies, like what she likes to do in her spare time, more about her thinking.

367
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:14,490
-She is a good student, she is a shy person, it is difficult to push her

368
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:24,240
under the circumstances because we understand she is sensitive and we don't...

369
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:32,470
I asked her to describe her character, she said whatever she said and information

370
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:40,010
which does not forthcoming is not usually valid.

371
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:46,370
If you push a person, you can make whatever you like finally.

372
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:53,330
What you are interested is that which comes forward which is immediate.

373
00:44:53,430 --> 00:45:07,010
That is an information which you grasp and you must have noticed in certain answers she gave,

374
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:15,100
she gave an emphasis. These are the important parts in a taking of the case.

375
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:21,100
-How about her dreams?

376
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:34,850
-Up to the time of this first love she had been a real child, very child like.

377
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:41,740
-Maybe you could inform us a bit more about her parents, I mean for example

378
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,750
for me it is very strange that when the daughter has her first boyfriend,

379
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:49,490
the mother gets so frightened that the daughter could leave the house

380
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,820
and threatens to kill herself.

381
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,660
Maybe you could give us some more information about the parents

382
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,520
and maybe also about the father.

383
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:06,650
-Looking at them from the outside they seem to be a perfect normal family.

384
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:11,480
The father works for the post office, he has a lot of Nux vomica in his picture,

385
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:18,360
he has suffered repeatedly from back pains which were always ameliorated by Nux vomica.

386
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:25,000
It's very, very difficult to get close to the mother, to approach the mother.

387
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:31,580
In my opinion she is Nat mur picture but in a very progressive state.

388
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:49,820
-When we take a case, we are interested primarily to see whether there exists

389
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,000
an exciting cause for the situation.

390
00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:02,410
What excited a chronic condition that was dormant there and brought about

391
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:11,580
the present situation. This cause is important, if we can have it.

392
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:17,980
In this case can we have the cause?
-Yes.

393
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:24,570
-Yes because it's very obvious that the girl herself says, after the boyfriend left me

394
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:27,590
I broke out with this problem.

395
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:36,740
So that is enough for us to go and use this symptom as ailments from grief or ailments

396
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:45,760
from disappointed love or ailments from whatever is the problem.

397
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:56,160
Further than that it is very difficult to use information which you try

398
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:02,010
to investigate more and more.

399
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:12,070
Sometimes you may arrive to a kind of answer which might be interesting

400
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:17,750
but most of the times you will not find more than what she says.

401
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:24,000
That the boyfriend left and she started with the colitis.

402
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:31,440
So what you can use here is ailments from disappointed love or ailments from grief.

403
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:45,420
-I think that there was a predisposition to her reaction.

404
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:51,820
So this predisposition is maybe important for us to understand and I feel that

405
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,310
I would like to know more about her early childhood

406
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:00,670
and maybe that could help us in finding the remedy.

407
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:02,670
-Why do you say there is a predisposition?

408
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:05,920
There is any reason for saying there is a predisposition?

409
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,240
-Because not every girl who is left by her boyfriend reacts in that way

410
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,980
with ulcerative colitis.

411
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:18,480
-Yes except of that, there was any other points in the history of that girl

412
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:27,570
to point out that there was actually a predisposition, there was a preparation of the organism.

413
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:32,070
-She would have had diarrhea from excitement and before examination etc.

414
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:38,900
-Because she had diarrhea on the excitement. That already shows the predisposition,

415
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,210
what we call there is a predisposition already, that's correct.

416
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:46,640
The moment she was excited, she had diarrhea.

417
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:56,050
-We heard from her homeopath saying that the mother was the reason.

418
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:00,040
I think I would have asked her exactly what happened.

419
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:04,460
Because she said it's because of the boyfriend, we didn't go in very deep

420
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,000
to see what caused the whole thing.

421
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:11,220
I don't know if the boyfriend left her, maybe she wanted to go with him and she couldn't

422
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:16,370
because of the mother and the struggle between herself, if she could stay with the mother

423
00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:21,510
and not with the boyfriend, that would make it. So we are not so clear about this point.

424
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:23,850
-This is what I said.

425
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:32,510
The fact that she is in grief or in disappointment is enough for us to  use it as a symptom.

426
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:38,510
Whether it was a combination of the mother pushing her to leave the boyfriend,

427
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:47,990
whether, whether, whether, it is still a symptom that we have to take.

428
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:55,020
Ailments from love disappointment, ailments from grief, if you want to make it more.

429
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:08,920
Combine the 2 symptoms and you have covered all the information that you may have.

430
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:17,920
That is what we have said. We have to compare what we know in the Materia Medica

431
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,690
with what we see in the patient.

432
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:39,770
Ailments from grief 3 times, diarrhea after grief 3 times, love disappointed 3 times.

433
00:51:39,870 --> 00:52:00,500
All 3 are combined into one symptom actually. Fear of dark, biting nails, cold drinks desire,

434
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:13,260
onions aggravate, trembling of hands, sexual desire wanting, brittle finger nails,

435
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:22,760
aversion to coition, suicidal disposition, hemorrhage from anus,

436
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,610
you really you can not see?

437
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:47,600
Flatulence, rumbling, sweets aggravate, unrefreshing sleep.

438
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:05,010
What is the first remedy?
-Lycopodium.

439
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:26,690
-Lycopodium, Phosphorus, Staphysagria, Ignatia, Nat mur, Calcarea carbonica, Sepia.

440
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:57,840
-Can you tell me why you haven't used the herpes symptoms?

441
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:14,170
-Why not. She does not have herpes now, she had herpes before this condition.

442
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:21,520
So it's an old symptom, it's doubtful whether you should take it now.

443
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:31,440
What you would expect is that after the remedy, you may have a break out again

444
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:35,940
of the herpes. That you may have.

445
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:41,010
-One question, how was the herpes treated?

446
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:49,850
-It was treated by Mercury which took away the herpes on the lips but not in the nose.

447
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,350
Show me columns.

448
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:05,340
Lycopodium, Sulphur, Medorrhinum, Ambra Grisea, Plumbum, Silica... Causticum.

449
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:33,250
What is against Lycopodium? Lycopodium comes as a remedy covering most of the symptoms

450
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:38,330
and also the Expert System says I can not make another decision.

451
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,930
What is against Lycopodium?

452
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:47,740
-You once said in another seminar that when Lycopodium comes up and Lycopodium

453
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:52,830
has a desire for cold water, you should thoroughly think about giving Lycopodium.

454
00:55:52,930 --> 00:56:02,590
-Correct. I said what is against Lycopodium, it is the fact that she desires cold water.

455
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:05,180
-But it's there.

456
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:17,590
-It is there, still it is the prominent remedy. The second point which is against Lycopod?

457
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:24,590
-She has an aggravation in the morning and an amelioration in the afternoon.

458
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:32,770
-No, wait a moment. The aggravation in the morning is with Lycopodium.

459
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:41,750
Lycopodium is aggravated in the morning, can not get refreshed from sleep, has unrefreshed sleep

460
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:48,420
and it's worse in the morning when it wakes up and wants to stay for a few hours before it

461
00:56:48,520 --> 00:57:07,240
can feel better but in the afternoon Lycopodium feels worse and it's better after 8 o' clock.

462
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:20,500
Now she says from 3 o'clock until 12 o'clock, this is my best time. It is a mixing.

463
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:30,480
-Lycopodium doesn't have disappointed love, it is not listed in the rubric.

464
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:45,980
-Yes, but Lycopodium has a sensitivity on the digestive system. She has a sensitivity

465
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:56,140
on the digestive system, so therefore any stress which affects the digestion

466
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:02,250
and in this way creating a colitis, it might be a Lycopodium case.

467
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:35,090
What is this? Diarrhea after grief, Phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid should be there

468
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:45,310
in a stronger degree and Lycopodium should be there also

469
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:52,160
because Lycopodium has an affinity with colitis;

470
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:58,850
so if there is an affinity, a predisposition and there is a stress and we have colitis,

471
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:01,920
the idea of Lycopodium should be there.

472
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:19,020
Ailments from grief, Lycopodium in a lower degree but it doesn't matter.

473
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:25,910
-Against Lycopodium speaks that ailments come not out, Lycopodium is famous

474
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:33,080
that it explodes when there is ailments inside. She is very kind in her character

475
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:35,440
and takes it all inside.

476
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,920
-No, this is not exactly like this.

477
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:52,660
Lycopodium will not speak their anger in front of everybody but only to those

478
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,580
who they can get away with this.

479
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:07,820
Otherwise they are afraid to express their anger in their school, their teachers, their chiefs

480
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:16,910
and only in the house where they know, the mother loves her, she can express,

481
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,600
in the father she can express.

482
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:25,170
Because they love and they know they get away, otherwise they keep the anger inside.

483
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:35,320
She appears not to be able to express her anger. Which is a main element in this case?

484
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:50,590
Not being able to express the anger and there is grief and ailments from suppressed anger.

485
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:05,070
So we have strongly here the idea of Staphysagria which does not appear

486
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:07,670
in the repertorization.

487
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:16,500
-The symptoms are not there, I did not put these ones.

488
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:23,010
-With Phosphoric acid I investigated the possibility, as you remember,

489
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:24,990
when I was asking about the feelings.

490
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:30,150
I was investigating where the feelings are dead or the feelings are alive.

491
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:38,660
If the feelings were dead, she says I'm indifferent, I don't care, I don't have feelings,

492
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:50,740
feelings are finished; then we have to investigate very seriously the possibility of Phosp.

493
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:57,150
But she said her feelings are alive. She had all that grief and all that grief

494
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:06,250
went into the guts and teared up the guts but not the feelings.

495
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,290
Therefore question mark for Phos acid.

496
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:19,610
There are two remedies, they have my name, it's not true.

497
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:26,360
The Buffo I have not said loves animals, I don't know how it got in

498
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:33,220
and also Pulsatilla has my name.

499
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:43,620
It is true for Medorrhinum and for Aethusa, it is true but Pulsatilla?

500
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:50,100
You see this also in order to be a symptom I have said many times, in order to take it

501
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:56,860
as a symptom you have to have pathology, that means collecting the animals,

502
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:03,710
sleeping with the animals, taking the animals, animals, animals. She is like that?

503
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:08,710
-If she could, she would do this.

504
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:23,280
-Even so, you can put this symptom but I will not pay much attention

505
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:36,880
because love for animals is rather what I consider a natural feeling.

506
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:46,610
If you take 3 or 4 symptoms, you chose the symptoms, you can make Staphysagria,

507
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:52,890
you can make Medorrhinum, you can make Sulphur, you can make Lycopodium.

508
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:57,290
With a few symptoms in this case, you can make anything.

509
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:09,270
So with the repertorization we get some ideas and then these ideas we have to process

510
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:22,560
and to see whether fits, what fits more, best, not completely. It's not possible

511
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:28,280
because as we said in the beginning this case is not a clear case

512
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:34,110
that we will have a clear remedy and we'll say that is a clear remedy.

513
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:38,550
So you see the struggle that we are having at the moment.

514
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:51,190
With Colocynthis how many symptoms?

515
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:55,190
-7 symptoms.

516
01:04:55,290 --> 01:05:00,600
-7 symptoms, rumbling, flatulence, hemorrhage from anus, disappointed love,

517
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:07,680
4 symptoms actually because the 3 first is one symptom.

518
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:15,230
-She says that she wants to be the best in the class and with another homeopathic teacher

519
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:19,590
I learned that Lycopodium wants to be the best.

520
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:33,940
-This again is... to want to be the best, who from this class does not want to be the best?

521
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:44,330
You don't want to be the best, wait a moment. You don't want to be the best,

522
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:52,350
that means your want is I don't want to be the best. Please don't make me the best, there is no.

523
01:05:52,450 --> 01:06:02,800
Therefore to be the best is again a natural state. When this becomes mania,

524
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:11,770
when it becomes totally engrossed with this idea I must be the best, I have to be the best

525
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:18,610
and I'm not the best and therefore I have a colitis, then it becomes a symptom.

526
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:27,610
But she wants to be the best, she is the best, it's not a symptom.

527
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:38,170
Show me the columns, Lycopodium is behind everything, show me Lycopodium,

528
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:56,600
why Lycopodium? 18 from 19? How can we get away?

529
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:07,750
-If the picture was not so clear, would you then say that we should reduce a little bit

530
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:11,360
the cortisone so to get a more clear picture?

531
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:21,260
-To reduce the cortisone is a very good idea but not in the island of Alonissos

532
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:27,670
because the moment that she gets through all that and she has to be hospitalized

533
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:34,170
and Lycopodium is not really the case and you try to find the remedy,

534
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:35,920
then you have some problems.

535
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,760
So I'm thinking another course of action.

536
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:48,680
-For 4 days she stopped taking cortisone orally.

537
01:07:54,680 --> 01:08:02,590
-4 days it is not enough because the action of cortisone is still going on

538
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:10,430
and we will see the results in a few days, in spite of the fact she takes still enema.

539
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:19,280
If we stop the enemas also within another 3-4 days, will start with the problems

540
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:25,330
and then we have to study another 3-5 days and then what happens?

541
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,450
We have to send her to the hospital.

542
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:56,770
-I don't want to speak for Lycopodium. I want a general information about this desire

543
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:05,520
for cold drinks. Could belong to a lower level and popping up?

544
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:15,360
-Yes of course, the desire for cold drinks is not totally excluding.

545
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:23,870
-The interest of the question is can you comment when is it for you a symptom

546
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:29,440
against Lycopodium and when do you see it as a popping up symptom?

547
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:41,180
-Very good question. Let's see.

548
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:48,400
Let us say we were debating on this case between Lycopodium and Phosphorus.

549
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:56,650
Is this a case of Phosphorus or is this a case of Lycopodium?

550
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:06,960
In such a case where the desire for cold water is in favor of the other remedy,

551
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:19,210
then you say that is against Lycopodium. We are debating here between Staphysagria, Sepia,

552
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:35,570
if you like, Sulphur, Nat. muriaticum and Ignatia had been given, Causticum.

553
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:47,560
Also we have the possibility of Causticum. What is in favor of Causticum in her case?

554
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:54,960
Can anybody tell me? You remember from the Materia Medica of Causticum,

555
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,810
a characteristic which she has?

556
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:08,980
-She is trying to make peace.
-It's very interesting.

557
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:22,710
He wants to say the characteristic of Causticum and I see he makes a gesture

558
01:11:22,810 --> 01:11:27,300
which has the characteristic of Causticum, so I say OK tell it.

559
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:37,550
He makes like that and I think he wants to say the Causticum has an eruption

560
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:40,230
on the tip of the nose.

561
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:48,790
I want to say the characteristic of Causticum, I say now you got it but he got the other.

562
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:52,210
The other characteristic of Causticum is of course the trembling

563
01:11:52,310 --> 01:12:05,310
and the excitement just before examination. Can you show me diarrhea before examinations?

564
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:13,030
Acidum nitricum of course is strong, Opium is strong and then from the remedies

565
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:22,610
we are thinking Lycopodium is there, Staphysagria is quite strong and she will be stronger,

566
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:30,900
Sepia, Phosphorus, Colocynthis, Bryonia, OK.

567
01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:40,550
In the beginning I also thought the possibility of Argentum nitricum because she says

568
01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:44,140
I'm worse heat, did you hear that?

569
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:49,280
And then she changed it, most probably it was a matter of misunderstanding.

570
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:57,290
Worse heat, worse with the sweets and diarrhea on examinations,

571
01:12:57,390 --> 01:13:01,040
this is case of Argentum nitricum.

572
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:08,040
The moment she says, no, no I'm worse from cold, not from heat the idea goes away.

573
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:12,880
What else I don't like for Lycopodium?

574
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:18,800
There is one more point which I don't like for Lycopodium, can anybody say?

575
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:27,710
There is one more point which is there, Lycopodium has the point

576
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:31,800
but she had to have it stronger for Lycopodium.

577
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:37,210
-She can sleep on both sides and Lycopodium ...

578
01:13:37,310 --> 01:13:44,210
-...sleeps on the right side, that's also but there is a symptom which she has

579
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:50,540
but for Lycopodium you should have it stronger.

580
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:51,900
-The desire for sweets.

581
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:02,940
-The desire for sweets for Lycopodium, the way that she describes it it's not a pathology.

582
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:09,420
Take out the desire for sweets.

583
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:10,940
-I don' have it.

584
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:16,360
-You didn't put it, very correct. You don't have to take it as a symptom.

585
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:24,830
-In the rubric aggravation from sweets you find Lycopodium in second degree

586
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:29,350
and she avoids sweets because she knows she is getting an aggravation.

587
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:38,180
-Formally before she would eat more sweets, she practically was eating just sweets.

588
01:14:38,930 --> 01:14:42,690
-Ah, that's important.

589
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:14,100
...Medorrhinum? Staphysagria? 37. Another remedy? Gelsemium?

590
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:20,850
Who has prescribed Gelsemium? No other.

591
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:28,860
Another case?
-Magnesia carbonica.

592
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:37,860
-Another case?
-Pulsatilla.

593
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,690
-Another case?
-Baryta carbonica.

594
01:15:45,690 --> 01:15:50,270
-Another case?
Argentum nitricum.

595
01:15:53,020 --> 01:15:57,230
-Another case?
-Sepia.

596
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,010
-Who has prescribed Sepia? Nobody.

597
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:09,250
Another case?
-Phosphoric acid.

598
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:31,760
-Can you show me diarrhea from anxiety? Has anybody done 3 symptoms?

599
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:41,000
Diarrhea from anxiety, diarrhea from anticipation, diarrhea from vexation.

600
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:54,420
This is a previous symptom which existed before the whole thing,

601
01:16:54,520 --> 01:17:00,510
so we'd like to get an idea which are the main remedies for doing this.

602
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:16,500
Put also anticipation. Gelsemium will be the first.

603
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:23,660
Gelsemium, Phosphoric acid, Argentum nitricum, Calcarea phosphorica, Colocynthis,

604
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:32,000
Ignatia, Opium, Phosphorus and then everything else.

605
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,260
-Position 23 is Lycopodium.

606
01:17:45,250 --> 01:18:06,830
-Put now bloody diarrhea and put rumbling 3 times and flatulence 3 times.

607
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:23,330
Put worse onions twice, Ignatia, Phosphorus, Kali phosphoricum, Lycopodium.

608
01:18:33,830 --> 01:18:38,920
Give me the Expert System.

609
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:11,370
Another important symptom for this case? Amelioration in the afternoon. Amenorrhea.

610
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:19,680
The amelioration in the afternoon can you find it? Afternoon, evening,

611
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,910
worse morning on waking.

612
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:37,580
The amenorrhea started immediately after... in the beginning before she had the cortisone

613
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:42,500
and it is a replacement, that means she loses a lot of blood,

614
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:47,220
the organism immediately says I can not lose more blood, forget this.

615
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:50,590
Now it's more important that.

616
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:58,480
Of course the repetitions now is the fact that she is losing still blood.

617
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:12,960
It is like a balancing of the organism because she is losing blood,

618
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:22,630
usually if we have strong chronic hemorrhage, the menses stop.

619
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:34,610
-I found a rubric stool bloody and with mucus and this is typical for ulcerative colitis

620
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:38,540
because we don't have any mucus.

621
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:42,450
-In her case?

622
01:20:54,630 --> 01:21:00,790
-In the beginning she had mucus and blood and I wanted to add something

623
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:02,660
concerning her menses.

624
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:20,790
Only about 3/4 of a year later, she told somebody that she was having this bloody stool

625
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:25,870
and all this time she didn't have the menses anymore.

626
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:32,450
Only 9 months later she told that she was having this diarrhea.

627
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:42,710
-Do you know what was her sexual desire before the incident?

628
01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:49,360
Was very sexual, was very strong sexual desire?

629
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:53,620
-Until she got to know this young man, she was a child.

630
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:02,800
3 months before she met this guy, she was playing with dolls.

631
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:14,020
When this boy went for staying in America, she went to get the pill,

632
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:18,520
the impression was more the pressure from the side of this boy

633
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:23,040
than she was really desiring sexual intercourse.

634
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:39,190
-Well this I have not seen it in the case, she did not appear to me

635
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:49,190
that she was really lacking in taking responsibility, it did not appear to me that

636
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:56,460
she was lacking in mental acuteness and understanding.

637
01:22:57,450 --> 01:23:06,200
Though she is short in stature and maybe later on we may be considering Baryta carbonica,

638
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:19,360
at this moment we have some pathology and we can not go away, unless we have strong indications

639
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:21,950
for Baryta carbonica.

640
01:23:22,050 --> 01:23:27,450
If she had said, I don't want to grow up, I just want to go backwards,

641
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:34,420
I just want to stay under bed cover, I just... She did not express any of this Baryta carbonica.

642
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:40,200
The rest is projection from our point of view.

643
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:48,580
She looks small yes but she is first in the class, she answers questions quite good

644
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:52,620
and she is quite intelligent.

645
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:06,020
We don't know that Baryta carbonica has this tendency to go into diarrhea,

646
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,630
it's not of the main remedies.

647
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:16,770
-But I think it's also very important to mention what Sabine said

648
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:18,850
after the interview was over.

649
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:25,030
She said her mother told her, she would commit suicide if she would leave her as

650
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:33,780
well and I think there might be a long lasting pathology in this family

651
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:41,520
and this might have a much more impact on her than that the friend was leaving.

652
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:48,870
So I think we should understand this point, to really find a good remedy.

653
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:58,680
-But even if you understand and even if you believe that this is not because

654
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:05,180
of the boyfriend leaving and it is because of some deeper pathology,

655
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:09,690
still you have to find the remedy and still you have to find the remedy based

656
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:13,290
on the symptoms that she is having.

657
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:22,050
-Aversion sex?
-Aversion sex is doubtful.

658
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:29,030
-I wanted to say one thing. Yesterday when you advised her to speak freely,

659
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:36,850
openly honestly and so on, if you remember, I saw that the tears were rolling up in her eyes

660
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:42,610
and I talked to her afterwards and she told me that during almost the entire interview,

661
01:25:42,710 --> 01:25:45,850
she was always fighting back, holding back her tears.

662
01:25:45,950 --> 01:25:51,860
She was at any moment ready to break out into tears and she really wants

663
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:55,850
to consciously precisely do everything right and she had told me

664
01:25:55,950 --> 01:26:01,960
that every answer she gave was to the best of her ability and knowledge.

665
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,850
-To add something. First of all this young girl left the young man,

666
01:26:11,950 --> 01:26:17,280
she was the one who ended the relationship, if you want to put it that way.

667
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:22,190
On the other hand she definitely does not want to hurt anybody

668
01:26:22,290 --> 01:26:26,440
and she is really paying good attention to answer precisely

669
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:31,370
and exactly, especially after you pointed it out again.

670
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:43,620
-Let me give you now my evaluation of the case.

671
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:53,200
My evaluation of the case is that I have been thinking strongly of 3 remedies.

672
01:26:54,460 --> 01:27:03,950
The one is Lycopodium, the other is Staphysagria and the third is Gelsemium.

673
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:15,630
Primarily these were the 3 remedies that I debated, which one?

674
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:21,860
And Lycopodium as we saw in the repertorization had strong points

675
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,460
according to the symptomatology.

676
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:28,710
It is a symptomatology that fits Lycopodium.

677
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:46,300
So for me two things were before the pathology. Once the pathology has developed,

678
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:52,690
we see the picture of Lycopodium quite strongly but not typically.

679
01:27:53,700 --> 01:27:57,350
She does not have the aggravation in the afternoon for instance,

680
01:27:57,450 --> 01:28:02,750
that we expect to have Lycopodium, afternoon aggravation.

681
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:08,110
On the contrary she has amelioration until midnight.

682
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:17,010
Lycopodium has an amelioration after midnight. Desires cold water.

683
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:57,140
Lycopodium also is really a coward and do not like to oppose and to go against

684
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:01,950
authorities and things like that and she is a pacifier.

685
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:06,340
Now I'm not sure Lycopodium is a pacifier.

686
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:13,910
A pacifier is Magnesias and that's why I believe somebody suggested Magnesia.

687
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:22,170
Magnesias don't like fighting, they like peace and they try to make peace.

688
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:34,500
So in this case I do not have enough symptoms finally to prescribe for a remedy.

689
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:43,500
Then I try to go backwards and see whether some of her symptoms could give me an idea.

690
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:54,580
And I see two definite symptoms that she has mentioned.

691
01:29:55,830 --> 01:30:01,140
One is the diarrhea with the excitement or with the anticipation

692
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:06,800
and the second is the trembling of the hands.

693
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:14,060
These are pathology symptoms which are definite, together with the character

694
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:27,550
which has not changed, that means a character who is weak in that confronting violence,

695
01:30:27,650 --> 01:30:30,570
confronting rudeness.

696
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:49,240
So I say to myself, if I had prescribed for this girl before, what remedy I would have given.

697
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:54,820
Now the remedy is Magn, what remedy I would have given during that time?

698
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:03,470
I would have given Staphysagria? Staphysagria is really suppressing her anger etc.

699
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:13,560
but is this enough? Staphysagria is also from anticipation we don't know it.

700
01:31:13,660 --> 01:31:20,410
On the contrary we know that Gelsemium is a person who is weak and trembling.

701
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:34,970
She said something else which continues until now, which is the general weakness.

702
01:31:35,070 --> 01:31:37,370
She says, I'm very weak.

703
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:49,130
And Gelsemium is of the main remedies with weakness, general weakness and trembling,

704
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:54,480
ailments from anticipation, ailments from anxiety.

705
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:01,750
-Timidity appearing in the public.

706
01:32:03,730 --> 01:32:08,140
-Timidity appearing in the public of course, the examination, it is an exam remedy.

707
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:13,230
If she has to take examination, then we give Gelsemium.

708
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:29,880
So in despair, because I can not find enough substantiated information at this moment

709
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:42,810
to prescribe on the pathology, Gelsemium is not very well known for ulcerative colitis, right?

710
01:32:43,550 --> 01:32:52,960
But, as we all know, pathology can be in any remedy but she gave me the impression

711
01:32:53,060 --> 01:33:02,130
from her symptoms, the trembling, the anticipation and the weakness, physical weakness

712
01:33:02,230 --> 01:33:10,120
and weakness in facing the public that the best remedy I would have prescribed

713
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:13,720
before this condition, would be Gelsemium.

714
01:33:19,730 --> 01:33:30,990
There is another rubric which says hearing bad news, just find me this.

715
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:46,540
Hearing bad news, that means suddenly without expecting, that is the idea of that rubric.

716
01:33:46,640 --> 01:33:56,120
Without expecting, you suddenly hear and immediately there is a reaction.

717
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:10,040
Somebody calls you on the telephone and says, I'm leaving tomorrow for America.

718
01:34:12,470 --> 01:34:22,330
In a case like this where she has been so naive, with the good meaning of the word,

719
01:34:22,430 --> 01:34:34,630
she is a nice, pure human being which does not understand of the intrigues of the human mind,

720
01:34:35,390 --> 01:34:40,870
that it may work on this way and that way and that way, she knows only one way.

721
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:57,040
Ailments from hearing bad news.

722
01:35:09,290 --> 01:35:12,710
-Gelsemium.

723
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:23,860
-Calcarea phosphorica should be there, higher than this but anyhow.

724
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:32,360
Gelsemium we know it is a remedy that because of that weakness she has in the organism,

725
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:41,610
she can not support hearing something very bad and immediately there is a reaction.

726
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:51,450
Where is the reaction? Mostly in trembling but in this case we have the immediate beginning

727
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:55,320
of the symptoms of the ulcerative colitis, why?

728
01:35:55,420 --> 01:36:02,320
Because she has a predisposition on the colon, irritation of the colon,

729
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:05,910
the colon gets irritated very easily.

730
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:58,010
Put it 4 times, see what happens. It doesn't matter, it imitates my thinking.

731
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:17,150
-George, all this was before the pathology. There are features which are still there,

732
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:24,400
she is still suffering from anticipation and anxiety but all this is before the pathology.

733
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:31,010
So do you think this is a Gelsemium layer now or it is underlined layer and she needs something?

734
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:42,060
-This is a good question. We might have given another remedy and we say most

735
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:47,560
probably Gelsemium is underneath, give this remedy and then wait and give Gelsemium.

736
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:58,400
If I was satisfied with another remedy, I would have given first this and then Gelsemium.

737
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:04,390
But as I'm not satisfied with another remedy, I will first try Gelsemium

738
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:15,240
which may fail but the most logical thing for me at this moment is to try Gelsemium for that girl.

739
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:32,740
-If you look at the symptoms, all the symptoms she has now, they are not from before.

740
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:39,380
It's all Gelsemium symptoms, also that she is getting better in the afternoon.

741
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:43,740
Here are all the Gelsemium symptoms.

742
01:38:58,730 --> 01:39:07,640
-So Gelsemium actually covers quite a lot of her symptomatology and the peculiarities

743
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:13,480
of the symptomatology though it does not cover the bloody stool.

744
01:39:31,990 --> 01:39:47,870
So Gelsemium 200 every day and with the idea to start reducing the enemas

745
01:39:47,970 --> 01:40:05,720
and see what happens. We give her every day 200, dilute in water and take it 3 times.

746
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:18,370
You give it to her and then tomorrow again 3 times and after a few days we'll try

747
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:23,220
to reduce the enemas or to stop the enemas.
