1
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:30,690
-And apart from that you had a psychological state which you described?

2
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:42,440
-After the remedy in the first week I was very nervous and at the end

3
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:51,040
of the first week all the physical symptoms had stopped, they are gone.

4
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:07,440
After a week I was calm, I had to sustain an exam and I was surprised how calm I was

5
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:20,540
and I felt well until January when I developed a fear of robbers.

6
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:46,940
I stay alone at my house and I wasn't afraid at all but since January I'm afraid,

7
00:01:47,040 --> 00:02:00,790
especially in the night because I think that they can come in my house and kill me.

8
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:13,440
I go to bed late 12-1 o'clock, I pay attention to all the sounds in the house

9
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:22,690
and in the morning I wake up very scared to see if not somebody comes in the house

10
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:32,270
and to see if I'm still alive. If I come late in the evening,

11
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:53,370
not too late 8-9 o'clock I'm looking all the house to see if there is somebody in.

12
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,370
And if I come later 11 o'clock I never come alone.

13
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:07,050
I make somehow that the person which I come with, to come with me in the house,

14
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:14,150
inside and after I look everywhere the person can go.

15
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:27,050
-Tell me was any reason for you to think that maybe...

16
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,800
you had in the neighborhood some robbers who got in?

17
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,900
-No.

18
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,900
-With no reason. It just developed this.

19
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:55,300
-Yes and in the day when I'm walking to work or somewhere else I have all the time

20
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:03,100
the feeling that something wrong will happen to me and I will die.

21
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,660
-Somebody is going to kill you?

22
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:17,380
-Not necessarily. If I cross the street I just start to create by imagination what

23
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:26,260
could happen if that car would crush me and die or descending stairs.

24
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:41,150
So because at the moment I thought that it is madness to have all the time this feeling

25
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:51,950
and I started to keep my mind occupied and to work intellectually much more

26
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:59,460
and it's very difficult because the day I must be busy all the time

27
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,800
and the night I couldn't sleep because I was afraid for robbers.

28
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:18,740
After 3,4 days if I don't go to my parents house to have a quiet night

29
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,130
and to rest I couldn't go on.

30
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:30,040
-That means if you have company or if you have somebody then it's OK.

31
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,390
-Yes it's OK, no problem.

32
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:58,300
-Something else?
-In April I had a conflict.

33
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:09,990
I was very nervous and I stayed in a draft and I took a cold and

34
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:17,130
the first symptom appeared, this was for the first time that I lost my voice.

35
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:30,100
Then it started a cough, it was between 4-6 in the morning without stopping

36
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:36,450
and 7-11 in the evening without stopping, four weeks.

37
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,140
-And in the meantime your voice was lost?

38
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,990
-No, the first week was lost and then coughing started.

39
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:54,100
-First week it was lost without coughing and then coughing started.

40
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,600
-Then in the 5th week I couldn't resist anymore because it was too much

41
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,850
and I took two allopathic pills.

42
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,190
-What it was?

43
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:19,790
-I don't know the word in English, a medicine against cough, not very strong

44
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:33,290
and Tussilago mother tincture. After a week cough stops.

45
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:56,190
Another thing is that I'm nervous and irritated more easily and I say what I have to say

46
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,040
and then in 5 minutes I calm again.

47
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:10,540
It's no so rare as it was, it's more often but it passes very quickly.

48
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,320
Another thing is that I forgot what I've just done.

49
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:26,970
I lock the door, I arrive in the street, I come back, I go to work, I arrive to work

50
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:35,360
and I say, did I close the door or not? And the gas, the light, everything.

51
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,360
-You have to check again and again.
-Yes.

52
00:08:51,150 --> 00:09:07,010
In February and March I ate a lot. I eat, after an hour I eat again, it's like

53
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:13,060
I never eat and after an hour I eat again and so on for two months.

54
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:22,180
-Then what you wanted to eat during that time? Anything?

55
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,230
-Anything.

56
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,280
-Not especially this or that or sweets?
-No.

57
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:38,530
-What about thirst?
-I'm very thirsty. I drink a lot.

58
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,180
-You want to drink constantly?

59
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:52,180
-Yes. Here in the class I drink 1 lit, maybe more , when I arrive at the hotel

60
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,280
I drink again the night I drink again.

61
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,680
-Do you drink little by little?

62
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:08,030
-No, large quantities. I have at home a glass of half kilo and if I'm very thirsty I drink it all.

63
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:17,310
-And it must be cold?
-Very cold, ice cold.

64
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:25,290
-You, yourself you feel the cold or not so much?

65
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:43,180
-Since April when I had that cold, I can say I'm a little more cold than usual,

66
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,790
I need to put more clothes.

67
00:10:54,530 --> 00:11:01,680
-This fear of robbers is only in the night or it can be in the day time?

68
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:17,710
-In the day is less because almost all the time somebody is with me and I'm secure.

69
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,280
I stay quiet.

70
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:37,680
-Are you concerned about your parents especially? You worry about them?

71
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,560
-Not especially.

72
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,180
-You have brothers, sisters?
-No.

73
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:58,030
-You are alone. And did you develop any relationship all this time?

74
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:07,110
-It was something in December but I couldn't. I tried and I just couldn't.

75
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,390
-You tried, what do you mean?

76
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:23,610
-I tried to not be so cold and to accept him but I just couldn't.

77
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:34,350
-What was the feeling?
-No feeling.

78
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,350
-No attraction?
-No.

79
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:48,300
-But do you have an attraction for somebody else? You look somebody who is in the office,

80
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:56,260
a patient or in the neighborhood where you look somebody and you say, I like him.

81
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
-No.

82
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:11,010
-The menses are regular?
-Yes but they are too long, 7-10 days.

83
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,950
-A lot of blood?
-Yes, the first six days yes.

84
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:40,350
-During the time when you were eating a lot... but you lost weight from the last time.

85
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:51,700
-No, I put 10 kilos. I tried to keep in diet but it was impossible, I just couldn't.

86
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:59,850
-Now after two months the appetite is less or still is the same?

87
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,280
-Definitely is less.

88
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,810
-And you start losing now weight?
-No.

89
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:20,670
-And you like to eat something which is more sweet or salty?

90
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:28,500
-I can't say that I like something special but I like at the end of the meal

91
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,850
to eat something sweet but not all the time.

92
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,750
-That something that has to be sweet, it has to be chocolate or anything?

93
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,950
-Anything, it doesn't matter.

94
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:43,250
-What about ice cream?

95
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:55,850
-I don't like so much as I liked it before. I can pass near ice cream and not take it.

96
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,350
But in the past it was impossible.

97
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,550
-What do you mean in the past?

98
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:10,640
-Before I take the remedy, if I see ice cream, I take it.

99
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,840
-Tell me as a child you had this fear of robbers?

100
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:31,190
-No. 2-3 years ago they took my bag and tried to steal something but I was in a bus.

101
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:56,590
-You sleep well, right through or you wake up in the night?

102
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:03,190
-No, I sleep very lightly and I wake up with every sound.

103
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,080
-So in the morning you are unrefreshed when you wake up?

104
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:22,430
-Yes, I have an hour or half an hour headache and I have an edema here in the eyes.

105
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,680
-In the morning?
-Yes.

106
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,320
-Only in the right side?
-No, both sides.

107
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,630
-And eventually it goes away?
-After 2-3 hours yes.

108
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:57,240
-You are working for yourself as a doctor or you work in the hospital?

109
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:11,090
-No, I work at a factory, I'm a doctor at a factory but I don 't know if I will stay there or not.

110
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:28,930
-What about other fear? You fear the dark?
-No. Now no.

111
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,080
-Before?
-Before yes.

112
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,930
-Strong fear of dark?
-When I was a child yes.

113
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:43,360
-Do you remember if you were afraid of thunderstorms?

114
00:17:43,460 --> 00:18:08,510
-No never. I have fear of earthquakes because I had the experience in Hungary.

115
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,760
-You have earthquakes in Hungary?
-Yes.

116
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,250
-How do you feel near the sea?

117
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:41,320
-Now I'm feeling well and I like the sun and since I'm here I feel well because

118
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:50,920
I have company but I like the sea and I like very much travelling.

119
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:11,320
-When you had this incident, when they took away your bag you were afraid at the moment,

120
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,800
you reacted or you did not react?

121
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:24,880
-No for the moment I couldn't do anything, I was paralyzed and then after a few seconds

122
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:38,890
I had a reaction, I shouted very strong, I started to tremble and then I had the courage to

123
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,480
look in my bag to see if they stole me something or not.

124
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:51,040
-So you manage to hold the bag or they took the bag?

125
00:19:51,140 --> 00:20:03,730
-No they cut it but they didn't manage to take it.

126
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,960
-In what position do you sleep?
-On the abdomen.

127
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,210
-Always?
-Always.

128
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,560
-All your life?
-Yes.

129
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:35,210
-Do you take fruits?
-Yes, not especially.

130
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:39,210
-You like fruits which are ripe?

131
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:52,460
-Before the remedy I liked sour fruits but now it can be all.

132
00:20:52,560 --> 00:21:05,010
-What symptoms you had that went away?
-My bag pains are gone.

133
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,310
-You had a lumbago by that time?

134
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:21,910
-Yes. It's still the problem with my eyes which now is worse.

135
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,960
-What is the problem?

136
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:33,960
-The problem is that from time to time when there is light, I see like a dark window.

137
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:46,060
Some spots, like dark hair and when I read I'm not sure if the book is clean.

138
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,960
-Did you see an ophthalmogist?
-Yes.

139
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,460
-What did he say?

140
00:21:52,560 --> 00:22:08,460
-He said to take vitamins. He said that I have something like wool in vitrus corpus.

141
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:43,320
I don't know how to say it. The sheep has wool. Something like that in the eye.

142
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:06,340
-Between menses do you have any leucorrhea?
-Yes.

143
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,290
-Strong?

144
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:17,790
-Not so strong after Sepia but it is still. It had stopped for one month and then it reappeared.

145
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:25,500
-The menses became more protracted, you have more blood?

146
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,750
-Yes.

147
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:36,330
-Was any desire for sexual contact?
-Not at all.

148
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,090
-If it doesn't exist, it doesn't matter.

149
00:23:49,190 --> 00:24:01,190
-Yes but I want so much to have children and this is not possible if I have no desire.

150
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:10,270
-But the desire for children, not the desire for sex.
-Yes desire for children.

151
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:19,020
-Would you like to have children even if you are not married?

152
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:39,500
-I thought this problem but I think it's no good for them. In our society is not good for

153
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:48,600
children without family and they will be hurt any moment and I don't want.

154
00:24:53,100 --> 00:25:00,850
-You have to be married in your society, Balkan society.

155
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,800
-The gums are bleeding more easy.

156
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,630
-With company you feel...

157
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:12,930
-But when I'm sad I must be alone, I don't want to be with nobody.

158
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:19,100
-You don't want to be seen being sad?
-Yes.

159
00:26:50,350 --> 00:27:05,500
-Would you say you have fear of death?
-Yes. All the fear that something will happen and ...

160
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:30,490
-Fear of death 3 times. If you eat something salty, you will have a reaction?

161
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:38,390
-No. I can't eat very salty.

162
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:46,070
-If it's something salty you feel bad?
-No, I just don't need it.

163
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:55,320
-The salt that you take is normal?
-Yes.

164
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,320
-It's not that you have aversion to salt.
-No.

165
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:20,340
-And the sweets that you want to take after food it is something very sweet or a cake?

166
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,480
-It doesn't matter. It must be something sweet.

167
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,830
-But very sweet? Like sugar, syrup?
-It can be.

168
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,080
-You still like it?
-Yes.

169
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,280
-Any perspiration during night?

170
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:47,380
-No, I do not perspire and I do not make fever if I take an influenza.

171
00:28:48,580 --> 00:29:03,830
-Do you have any kind of to be fastidious, you need order very much.

172
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:19,580
-Yes, very. And if I start to make a thing, it must be like I want.

173
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,830
If it isn't I start again and again and again until I make it perfect.

174
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:36,830
-The way that it will satisfy yourself.
-Yes and I must do it in the shortest time possible.

175
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:44,330
-So you are in a hurry, you feel it inside you?
-Yes, in a great hurry.

176
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:58,830
-And your things, your clothes is in order?
-No, this not.

177
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,730
-Only you need order in your work.

178
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:18,320
-Yes, order in my work and in the house but with clothes sometimes I put them here and there.

179
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:29,430
-But are you particular with what you are wearing? You want to be fit in colors and to be nice?

180
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,270
-Yes.

181
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:14,490
-You say if you have company, you are not afraid.
-Yes.

182
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,140
-And you said you feel more cold than before?

183
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:13,140
-Yes it's about a week or two because I just finished the (?).

184
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,350
My colleagues observed that I'm much colder than before.

185
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:33,450
-Did you take any other medication during that time?

186
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,040
-No, I was afraid to take anything.

187
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,050
-OK very good.

188
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,170
I don't want to marry but I'm very happy because of that.

189
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:57,590
I don't want to have a relationship but I'm happy.

190
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:10,730
So the problem you come to be treated is not to find a husband or the problem is not that

191
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,600
I want to have a relationship.

192
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:21,980
So he comes to you to be treated for something, that something what it is?

193
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,830
How you will define it?

194
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:42,830
When she was rejected by this particular man because he left her, she was happy or unhappy?

195
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,730
-Unhappy.

196
00:33:51,580 --> 00:34:02,580
-She was unhappy. She is so unhappy that in the scale in which we saw here...

197
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:19,330
I'm very impatient for these machines.

198
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:33,830
So why she came to be treated?

199
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:44,730
You will say she came to be treated mostly because on an emotional level she has

200
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:48,580
a depression which has gone almost to apathy.

201
00:34:49,830 --> 00:35:01,080
This is why she came to be treated because she came depressed after this incident.

202
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:19,230
Before this incident she was a happy girl. After that incident she went into a deep depression

203
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:28,420
to the extend that went further than depression in an apathy state, no emotions.

204
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:39,170
This is what you are treating when you try to prescribe on this case.

205
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:46,480
So you have to have this idea where is the problem and what is the problem you are treating

206
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:54,170
and that's why she was given perhaps Nat. mur. and Ignatia and things like that.

207
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,670
Then we analyzed the case and then we gave a dose of Sepia.

208
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:21,500
What happened after Sepia according to what she said yesterday, this everybody remembers.

209
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:39,670
A week later she felt great calmness, she felt actually very good, correct? Correct.

210
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:55,670
She is feeling good and suddenly 4 months later there are some phobias, fears arising.

211
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:06,170
Where are the phobias? Can you see there?

212
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:23,160
I did not write this down, I've written it 20-30 years ago.

213
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:45,410
This is a photocopy from the page of the book the Science of Homeopathy written in 1976

214
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:57,560
and published for the first time in 1978. The observation by that time was that

215
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:05,660
this is how you attain a cure by treating several...

216
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:15,160
And I have said before we have to treat sometimes with 2,3,4 remedies.

217
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:34,220
You have 2,3,4 remedies that you have to treat the case and it comes like this.

218
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:47,870
It is not that you give the 5 remedies and you are on this level. No.

219
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:58,130
You are treating and as one level goes away, then the other, you are going towards a cure,

220
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,310
a general balance.

221
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:31,940
In this 3-dimensional , she comes to be treated for the emotional level mostly

222
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:46,610
with a deep depression, a shock that the organism could not handle it and said, stop the emotions

223
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,960
because they are so painful that I can not handle it.

224
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,200
This is the reaction of the organism.

225
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:04,620
That means her organism decided that if I keep on having emotions, I'm not going to be alive,

226
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:14,100
I'm going to die, I can not stand. The organism makes this decision

227
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:26,020
and brings the problem on this level, this is not unusual story what happened to her.

228
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:33,020
I have heard the story many times, that I was ready to get married.

229
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:37,770
Sometimes women are left in the church.

230
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:42,500
They have gone to the church, everything is OK, they go to the church and the man

231
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,880
does not appear, this is even worse.

232
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:54,430
I don't think this was your case, your case was similar but not so...

233
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:04,520
But for her it doesn't matter, for her it is a matter of life or death.

234
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:12,850
Therefore she goes into depression. What we are treating? We are treating a deep depression

235
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:24,340
and we have to understand that this is what we are treating.

236
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:37,250
Otherwise we may be thinking we're giving a remedy for her so she can have a boyfriend

237
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,850
or something like this, this is not the case.

238
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:52,350
Whether she will have a boyfriend or not it's a lot of other things, coincidence, environment etc.

239
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:05,160
Now you have given this remedy and the remedy has produced certain changes and the changes

240
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:22,520
that produce is on the first level, it is a feeling that I now feel better in my emotional condition.

241
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:36,520
Then some fears arise. Did you hear these fears in the first interview?

242
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:42,260
-Yes, fear of death and then her next fear was to remain alone.

243
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,660
And she was afraid of earthquakes and then she was also afraid of robbers

244
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,090
because they had broken into her house.

245
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:18,840
-What happens? As I have said many times, we gave Sepia.

246
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:42,160
This is Sepia and this is thenext remedy we're going to decide and the next remedy had a few symptoms,

247
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:56,910
just from the underline level, a few symptoms popping up because the fears which she mentions

248
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:04,510
were not appearing to us, at the moment of the first interview that this was the main issue. Right?

249
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:14,240
Did you get the impression from the first interview that the fears were the main issue to be treated?

250
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,240
-No.

251
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,590
-You agree all in that?
-Yes.

252
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:28,240
-So the fears were not the main issues because there was something else more important

253
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:41,590
and that something else was the depression. Once the depression is lifted then the fears appear.

254
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:50,740
The question that we have to deal with in this case, if we want to proceed with the correct treatment

255
00:44:50,840 --> 00:45:03,590
is a big question. The next remedy is it clear?

256
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:17,990
If it clear there is big hope that we can improve her health very much and you may be seen

257
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,950
in another interview the third remedy appear.

258
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:35,470
But at this stage those who studied her case as a follow up, have you seen a clear remedy coming?

259
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:49,720
This is the question that you have to ask yourself. Is the next remedy clear?

260
00:45:51,970 --> 00:46:00,140
If it clear there is big hope that the health can improve dramatically.

261
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:11,380
The moment it is unclear, we have to wait, we have this, we have that.

262
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:23,370
Now the picture of the problem that she presented is a totally different picture which has

263
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:25,970
another picture, another remedy.

264
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:32,220
Who says the remedy is clear now?

265
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:48,720
Do you all agree that this is the same remedy you're talking?

266
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:13,220
In order to do that we have to study again her symptomatology. You have it there?

267
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:23,960
Put the symptoms now, in order to study her symptomatology at this level.

268
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:32,050
The case is a case of phobias at this moment, correct? You agree.

269
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:43,110
-I have a question because there is something I don't understand because I thought that

270
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:48,210
normally the emotional level should be better at the first time and then...

271
00:47:49,410 --> 00:48:00,870
-You thought? That is why in 1973 I said, watch out, it's not like this.

272
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:14,270
Sometimes you will have to go through the hierarchy and go from one system to another

273
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:18,120
and then you have a direction of cure.

274
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:28,020
In the same way you think almost everybody else was thinking by 1976 and that's why I said,

275
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:39,020
in order to have a cure we have to have a step by step system by system,

276
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,960
more and more towards health.

277
00:48:47,990 --> 00:49:00,110
So this is what you are learning here. Otherwise if what you knew was correct,

278
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,460
you don't have to be here.

279
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:17,190
So what you are saying is correct for a case which is much more mild in which case we will see that

280
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:22,370
the emotional goes well and the physical goes worse.

281
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:34,860
There is another even more mild case again with some mental-emotional symptoms in

282
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:45,450
which mental-emotional and physical all go away and everything appears in the skin

283
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:54,310
and there is another more mild case that everything mental-emotional and physical just

284
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:57,990
vanish without any further problem.

285
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:06,890
So it depends on the depth of the case whether it is possible to do the first,

286
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,740
the second or the third possibility.

287
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:17,640
-Sorry but how can you explain that the fear of robbers which has been before...

288
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:27,140
-I don't have to explain. I said in 1976 when I wrote this book, which I presented to you

289
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:35,220
I said that it is deeper that the apathy and the sadness and the suicidal depression is

290
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:38,570
deeper than a state of phobia, why?

291
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:48,470
Because I have seen in treating thousands of cases that before you make a cure, you

292
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:54,410
have to go through these steps, unfortunately.

293
00:50:55,410 --> 00:51:01,060
-I have a question. I have looked at this model and I appreciate that she has gone in the direction

294
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,810
that you are describing but in her recent case she spoke of being forgetful and

295
00:51:05,910 --> 00:51:09,810
I couldn't reconcile that with improvement.

296
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:19,660
-Forgetful you go onto the mental level. Forgetfulness is very low in the...

297
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:37,760
See the mental level. Absent mindness is the mildest and then forgetfulness is very mild.

298
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:43,310
And as you go lack of concentration, dullness, lethargy, delusion, paranoid ideas,

299
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:49,640
destructive delirium, complete mental confusion etc. and then you have the schizophrenia

300
00:51:49,740 --> 00:52:04,640
of course. So what is important in this case is, as I said, to find whether the next remedy

301
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:10,490
which appears, has the symptoms that she describes.

302
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:24,070
And the symptoms, just put them down. Can you all read the symptoms?

303
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:34,910
Copious menses, fear of death of course, which is the main issue, the fear of death which

304
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:40,010
underlines her symptoms as she described them.

305
00:52:49,510 --> 00:53:00,160
What is the remedy? Some people put up their hands for knowing the remedy.

306
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,160
Which is the remedy?
-Arsenicum.

307
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,410
-Arsenicum.
-Arsenicum.

308
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:19,660
-The majority wins. It is true that I was vacillating between Phosphorus and Arsenicum.

309
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:28,250
Arsenicum and Phos. actually they are very close, it has first Arsenicum, then Phos.

310
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:49,320
Mama mia! We agree. If you remember I asked her whether she likes order and she said

311
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:59,920
yes but not in my clothes. Arsenicum really is orderly even in the clothes.

312
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:13,080
The feeling of coldness is both for Phosphorus and for Arsenicum, the fear of death is for

313
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:23,320
both and the fear for robbers is more strong with the Arsenicum.

314
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:35,000
Arsenicum, as we have said in the lectures, he is searching to find the robbers.

315
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,390
How is the thirst, I don't remember.

316
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,890
-Ice cold water.

317
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:57,860
-Ice cold water is in favor of Phos. and not in favor of Arsenicum.

318
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:08,060
-I want to add that she has a great deal of thirst for cold drinks in big sips and as far as

319
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:16,610
I know, Arsenicum has got thirst for little sips for water and this speaks rather for Phosh.

320
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:38,010
Find thirst and show them. For the lady that said that I know that Arsen. has thirst for

321
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:49,760
small quantities frequently, which is true, also true is that Arsen. also has great thirst

322
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,510
for large quantities, equally true.

323
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:59,310
So you are learning now that Arsen. has strong thirst equally for big quantities.

324
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,360
One by one.

325
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:25,840
The desire for child or no child etc. can not be a big issue here. If somebody will say

326
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:40,190
that I don't want children and states a reason why, it is not an aversion to children

327
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:47,030
because some choice is there.

328
00:56:56,510 --> 00:57:03,920
Platina for instance. They don't want children or they don't want to get married or

329
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:12,270
they are afraid of getting married, therefore they say I will not marry.

330
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:29,610
This is Nux vomica but if they say, I will not marry because I can not support a

331
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:38,110
family, I feel I'm not well educated, I can not earn enough and I can not support a family.

332
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:39,990
This is not a Nux vomica case.

333
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:48,860
-This is a sure case of Arsenicum for 3 reasons. There is no fear of thunderstorms,

334
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:58,710
she cares for her parents and she wants everybody work really well and precise, as she does.

335
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:02,810
-Of course I said it.

336
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:09,810
-You said it but he forgot. Then it's my problem.

337
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:19,910
Yes I agree. These are the points on which also I was vacillating

338
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,840
between Phosphorus and Arsenicum.

339
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:30,820
She could be Phosphorus, there is no question and especially with the

340
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:33,170
bleeding which has increased.

341
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:38,420
This is a strong point in favor of Phosphorus.

342
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:49,920
There is no question and if Arsenicum fails, then definitely we go to Phosphorus.

343
00:58:51,670 --> 00:59:01,570
But for the reasons that mentioned also first I would try... It was a difficult decision

344
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:13,250
because of the cold water and the increase in menses with a lot, much more blood

345
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:27,460
this is big change pointing to Phosphorus. And I was going for Phosphorus

346
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,760
but then I could not confirm it.

347
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:37,730
On the other hand the Arsenicum idea was coming up more and more clear.

348
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,880
-Aversion to sex?

349
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:54,980
-Still about the aversion to sex I feel that she needs time to digest.

350
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:09,130
You change the chemistry of the system but the system still needs to digest a traumatic experience

351
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:14,880
which took place so deep and created such a deep problem.

352
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:22,150
When she came, she was in despair. Today I don't think she was in despair so much.

353
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:29,050
-She says no, I was not in despair. She may not even have come for a second interview

354
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:40,630
and the third interview will say, we will say, will you please come? OK, what can I do?

355
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:48,380
I will come. But when the problem really is pushing, forget about it.

356
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:57,630
She was having big problems to appear in front of the class, it's not easy. Do you understand?

357
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:02,300
I hope you understand these things and you evaluate these things

358
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,970
and in your evaluation of the case,

359
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:09,570
these things have to be taken into consideration.

360
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:34,650
After the Arsenicum, when then she will think out things, she will try maybe once again

361
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:46,310
the experiment but under different circumstances because I believe by the time she had

362
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:57,220
the first affair with this man, she was not really in a healthy condition and that's why the

363
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:02,570
depression went so deep as to destroy the feelings totally.

364
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:15,570
Now once she will feel more strong, she will try and she will handle the situation.

365
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:29,970
-I want to say something. I think she is still very reserved she is not that open as Phos. is

366
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:35,220
and I think that the children, you asked her if she would have children without being married,

367
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:40,220
is a totally different thing and she said that she would not dare in this society

368
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,800
to bring children without being married.

369
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:52,550
-Exactly, if you have a reason... For instance the Greek society also is very conservative.

370
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:58,550
So you can not do outrageous things that you can do in USA.

371
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:09,320
She was just telling me what outrageous things are going on with the young generation in America.

372
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:21,070
For us here in Greece, they do crazy things but not that craziness.

373
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:30,230
-George, as you said, fear of death is the issue here, the closeness between these two

374
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:36,720
remedies is, the difference is only in degree and in her case we don't see the hypochondriasis

375
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:38,550
as in Arsenicum.

376
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:44,390
She was sick for 4 weeks with that terrible cough and she never prescribed for herself that

377
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:48,880
she could have all sorts of help, she went all alone and then she took a small remedy which

378
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:55,310
just helped her and the anxiety and the fear of death is more frequent, it's not just death.

379
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:58,250
Crossing the street I might have an accident.

380
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:05,360
Something might happen, so could it be Phosphorus?

381
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:11,100
-I thought you were saying all that in favor of Arsenicum.

382
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:26,670
You said exactly the opposite. I will tell you something, the difference between Phos. and

383
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:30,020
Arsenicum... Show anxiety about health.

384
01:04:41,770 --> 01:04:51,420
Both remedies have fear of death but Phos. is much more anxious and hypochondriac

385
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:59,750
than Arsenicum. Arsenicum is not so much hypochondriac as Phos. is.

386
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:08,250
Phos. is more hypochondriac, has more anxiety about health where Arsenicum in spite of the fact

387
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:16,850
that appears capital in the fear of death, does not appear capital in the anxiety about health.

388
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,370
Is it correct what I said?

389
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:52,990
In the Synthesis Arsenicum is on the first degree in anxiety about health and then Phosp.

390
01:05:53,090 --> 01:06:06,260
is in the second degree. That means in any case Arsenicum is less anxious than Phos.

391
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:17,920
You got it? Very simple. This is the idea where the fear of death is equal,

392
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:29,590
the anxiety about health is less in Arsenicum than Phos.

393
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:56,240
The Arsen. here should have been risen to the second degree from the first degree and

394
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:03,320
the Phos. should raise to the third degree instead of the second. This is the correction

395
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:04,670
if you want to do it.

396
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:16,090
But they have done it out of my lectures and things like that, they have added symptoms.

397
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:37,090
But those who said Phosphorus is a possibility it's very close, they might be correct.

398
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:52,090
We don't know yet. I will start with Arsenicum, what potency? 10M? 50M? CM?

399
01:07:57,590 --> 01:08:15,240
It doesn't matter. 200. Arsenicum 200 will be good. Also these fears are not really deep.

400
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:25,070
You see, when I'm with company, I have no fears. I see her color. The color is very good.

401
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:29,820
The circulation has started. Now the emotions will start, don't worry.

402
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,670
The emotions will also come quite...

403
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:51,590
I will tell you a secret. If somebody is embarrassed and is becoming red, it's a good sign.

404
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:59,820
If he is embarrassed or fearful and becomes white it's not a good sign for the health.

405
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:10,940
Hippocrates used to do this. This is not Hippocrates, since it is my observation.

406
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:19,320
Also people who blush will tell you the truth more easily, people who become white while

407
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:25,440
you examine them, they will not tell you the truth, they will tell you what they like.

408
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:42,620
They are driven by the head, the head dictates everything. So if you can blush, it is a very good

409
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:50,110
thing, for men and for women, especially for women because women usually tell lies.

410
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:51,660
Oh my god!

411
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:19,880
I take it back. Actually my wife has never lied. Don't laugh because it is true.

412
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:43,060
The remedy is clear in this case?
-No.

413
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:55,700
-You see we have some difficulties. We said, if the remedy is clear then there is great hope.

414
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:59,630
Is this remedy clear, yes or no?

415
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:01,110
-No.

416
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:03,210
-Almost.

417
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:07,040
-Both are clear.

418
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:22,350
-In this case you say either this or that is going to work. That is clear enough for Homeopathy.

419
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:29,090
We have so many problems, so many troubles. Many times you see...

420
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:36,590
this and that but when it comes to the point where you say Arsen.

421
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:41,740
is quite strong or Phos. then it's clear.

422
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:49,590
So actually she is, I could say, quite clear for the situation.
