1
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,070
This case it was between small remedies, remedies that are unknown.

2
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,480
No known remedy we had to differentiate about.

3
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,710
They were rather small remedies all of them.

4
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:56,540
In such case the differentiating point is going to be only one point which may be quite strong.

5
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:13,090
We had an aggravation from heat which had to be in the remedy.

6
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:22,600
Amelioration by cool. That was a strong symptom that was not only said in the case.

7
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,430
This man was after me every day in Alonissos.

8
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:33,670
He would come and say yesterday when I gave you the case I was feeling very good after all

9
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,030
but today... and he would cry.

10
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:46,190
Because it's too hot... A Pulsatilla kind but not Pulsatilla.

11
00:01:47,690 --> 00:02:03,700
This element of heat was not possible for me to fit it so strongly to one of these remedies.

12
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:11,200
There is also some information about Secale before.

13
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:17,700
Otherwise your mind can not go but this is how the Materia Medica has developed.

14
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,010
And this is what I try to do, to show you.

15
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:31,860
There was an element also in him, which is common in Secale...

16
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,360
Do you remember the expression I used about his anxiety about health?

17
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:52,090
-Intensity.
-Yes.

18
00:02:52,190 --> 00:03:02,010
There is an intensity in complaining about their health

19
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,350
but they will never say I have anxiety about health.

20
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:14,250
But they complain in such concern about themselves

21
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,020
that then this becomes a  characteristic symptom of the remedy.

22
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:30,100
Secale has an anxiety about health, which is not said like that. I'm afraid I have cancer.

23
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:38,010
But there is an intensity in stating the symptoms, which behind this intensity

24
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:47,850
you perceive the anxiety, while at the same time you see stagnation.

25
00:03:53,100 --> 00:04:04,350
There is a very easy swelling of the legs, the legs are painfully burning

26
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:10,690
and many times they have to put a fan all night to cool down the feet.

27
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,180
The masturbation?

28
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,940
We can ask him.

29
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:47,250
What I think it will happen even without asking is the power  of control for masturbation

30
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:54,100
will be much greater. He will not give in to masturbation so easily.

31
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,750
I have seen this again and again and you will see it also in your practices.

32
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:11,150
When the hormones are leveled, the driving is not so strong and we know that from the Platinas

33
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,750
especially because after all sex is enjoyable.

34
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:29,150
When a Platina has desire for sex 6 times a day and enjoys that and you give a remedy

35
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:36,510
and it's only becoming once the day or once every 3 days, then she is very disturbed.

36
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:44,400
Platinas will not like to change that particular portion of their activities

37
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,250
but when you give it they will change and then they complain.

38
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:57,510
Never mind how much they want, the organism does not anymore demands that.

39
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,750
So there is a balance.

40
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,500
In this way, in his case it's going to be a balance. That was a kind of release for him.

41
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,650
There is an element which I have seen in at least 2 Secales,

42
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:36,700
there is an element of out of the reality element with a kind of naivety, in this case.

43
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,000
It's a boy of 13-14 years old.

44
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:51,400
Actually Peter was telling me that one of the reports he has sent me about him,

45
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,000
he was writing he is crying like 14 years old girl.

46
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:06,000
There is a kind of immaturity in this man.

47
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:13,820
In another case we'll see that as an element of idealism.

48
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,030
It is presented as an element of idealism.

49
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:27,990
I have to have ideal situations in order to... Idealism is quite prominent.

50
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:38,240
I can't do this, it's not right. This is not a symptom.

51
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:49,810
When somebody says I cannot do this, it's not right but this is the only thing

52
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,660
that will save his life or somebody else's life, then it's kuku.

53
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,410
This you have to do it, it's not so big.

54
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,660
No, I can't do it. That is pathology.

55
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:09,300
Pathology is not when somebody proposes to you to do something really immoral

56
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,410
and you say I cannot do it. This is natural, this is healthy.

57
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,310
-Do you think Lycopodium could be underline here?

58
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,150
-It can be.

59
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:38,550
But if you touch him now...

60
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:51,000
You say let's see if Lycopodium can improve him much more, we will destroy him.

61
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:59,280
I do not have the follow up after Gelsemium to show you how he became

62
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:08,880
and how he was totally destroyed by a remedy which was close.

63
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:17,120
When I did the original analysis of the case, I mentioned Gelsemium like I mention it here.

64
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,120
I can't remember by that time what I have mentioned.

65
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,110
Peter told me you mentioned Gelsemium and the practitioner preferred to give Gelsemium

66
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,450
than Secale because they did not understand Secale and also I said in the class

67
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,200
that I can not explain to you with the information that you have in hand.

68
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,220
So they gave him Gelsemium and they told him this is what George has said

69
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,450
which was not exactly the truth

70
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:53,550
because George also mentioned other remedies, Selenium, Mercurialis...

71
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,700
If you had seen the whole case, we did not go through the whole case originally I think.

72
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,700
There are more questions but sometimes they tell me you don't want to see the whole case

73
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,950
and it is better if we stop at a certain point.

74
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:19,450
You may see even in the very end differentiating the possibility

75
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:22,320
and asking questions for a remedy.

76
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,370
He cannot be Lachesis, why? Can anybody tell me?

77
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:44,110
He is not full of energy, Lachesis has a vital...

78
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,790
I would say the opposite of what he has in circulation.

79
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,770
Lachesis has a strong circulation and that's why we see high blood pressure with Lachesis,

80
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:02,270
there is a very vital circulation, which gives a lot of energy.

81
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:08,190
Here we have a stagnation of circulation which gives no energy at all.

82
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,600
What is their blocking we do not have the possibility.

83
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:21,850
Is that the arteries are closed, the circulation is disturbed?

84
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:27,680
It is the cerebrospinal fluid that may have created such a situation obstruct

85
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:33,180
and we do not have a flow of the cerebrospinal fluid? That is another possibility.

86
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:41,850
What happens in the encephalomyelitis cases? We don't know yet all the pathology.

87
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:51,340
That is why we are left here with the desire to cure the person and not to explain everything

88
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,690
which is taking place, it's not possible.

89
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,340
-What about Staphysagria?

90
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:11,440
-Staphysagria will not say I have no feelings at all. It is difficult to destroy her feelings.

91
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:21,180
There are feelings there in Staphysagria but suppressed and in spite of being suppressed

92
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,250
they are nice feelings.

93
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:34,680
They don't become feelings with spikes, Staphysagria has round feelings

94
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,880
that do not hurt others, like Pulsatilla.

95
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:56,600
There is going to come out one way or another, in mucus membranes, the skin...

96
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,500
-In the rubric coldness of head...

97
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,490
-Coldness of head, which is the well-known symptom of Carbo vegetabilis

98
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:23,580
when it's ready to pass out, when most probably the circulation has stopped

99
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,330
and it becomes cool.

100
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:35,670
There is slight perspiration. It's a disturbance on the circulatory system of...

101
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:44,270
while he is heated, suddenly the blood stops going to the head and there is a fainting.

102
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:49,510
This is coldness of forehead, this is another thing.

103
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:57,190
It's a peculiarity, I've never seen it again. If we find it 2-3 times,

104
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,260
we can add it to Secale symptomatology.

105
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,660
What is interesting to see is that type of anxiety and the feeling

106
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,410
that something terrible is going to happen.

107
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:19,510
In the other two cases it was a feeling as if they will go crazy.

108
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:26,660
It was not the description of this blockage; nothing goes out, nothing goes in.

109
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,260
It was a feeling as if they will go crazy but they will not say it.

110
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:40,920
They will hardly admit it to themselves but the intensity for

111
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:46,420
which they presented the symptomatology indicated an underline anxiety,

112
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,760
which if you enquire they will admit, they will say a few things about it.

113
00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:02,490
-After all his last remedy was Mercurialis...

114
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:10,900
-It interfered for some time, he was not feeling well.

115
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:20,320
I think it interfered but not decisively, to spoil the case.

116
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,160
What it's interesting in this case it is this curve.

117
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,750
I have told you many times, there is a curve going up and then suddenly it goes down.

118
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,400
Then if you wait, you will see it coming up again and then suddenly it will go down

119
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,990
and it will go up and will go down and will go up.

120
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:58,060
That is the time when you go down that we have to be strong enough not to be misled

121
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,660
to prescribe another remedy.

122
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:07,410
That is the time where you need most of your reasoning and understanding of the Theory.

123
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,660
-Which other remedies belong to this family?

124
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:31,070
-I don't know. What is the family of Secale?
-Ustilago.

125
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:47,570
-Ustilago also has definitely action on the uterus and on the women genitalia.

126
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,520
-Sexual excitement?
-No.

127
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,120
-But you said that.

128
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,880
-No, I said similar with idealistic situation.

129
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:24,110
What I meant is that they need a kind of idealistic situation to express their sexual energies

130
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,880
and maybe they go to masturbation.

131
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:38,030
I don't see promiscuity, in order to express sexuality, they need an environment

132
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,400
which is idealistic.

133
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:53,540
But this does not exclude the possibility that they may be excited.

134
00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:01,120
What we have to understand mostly and what is interesting it to understand

135
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,970
that the circulation...

136
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,520
The circulation is stagnated like we speak in Sepia.

137
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:39,870
Fantasy? Yes, strong fantasy but the element I have seen is that

138
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,060
these people will not talk about their sexual things, as he talked.

139
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:56,140
Maybe the sexual desire is strong but they need a condition, a circumstance

140
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,190
which is idealistic kind.

141
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:07,300
Like true love, like we meet and there is a strong romantic element

142
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,230
and then they may get involved.

143
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:20,300
Fantasy you mean by masturbation? I do not know. I cannot say at this moment.

144
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:34,220
But if the assumption is correct that the circulation is lower, it is not strong,

145
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:48,450
the functions are lower. There is no strong vital force and there is no sexual urge.

146
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:53,050
But you will say he is having a strong sexual urge. He is not.

147
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,130
For me it is a release of the condition.

148
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:07,530
It's like something which is going on is suddenly stagnated and you try to push it

149
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:13,030
somewhat to keep on going. The excitement of masturbation.

150
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,860
This is how I feel in this case is the masturbation.

151
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,280
It's not a real pleasure, desire to masturbate.

152
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:29,050
It's a kind of an excitement that has to have to get out of that stagnant situation.

153
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,780
Can you imagine if you enter this man, nothing comes in, nothing comes out.

154
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,590
It's a dead man.

155
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:43,220
The only thing he can be sure about that he is alive, is when he masturbates.

156
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,440
That's how I perceive it. He is a dead person.

157
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:53,440
When you are in a healthy situation, you are not living that situation and you are outside

158
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:59,200
and you are looking but just imagine that nothing will come in.

159
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:07,690
He says I have here a wall inside, nothing comes in, nothing goes out.

160
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:16,880
So he lives in a dead situation, he just walks but somewhere he feels

161
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:24,100
that is absolutely bad and he has to have an outlet.

162
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:33,940
He has to have a release of that constant sense of death which is inside him

163
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,440
and he masturbates. This is how I feel the masturbation.

164
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,550
It's not a strong urge to masturbate.

165
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:53,950
I'll tell you something else which I found through the remedy.

166
00:21:54,050 --> 00:22:00,190
If the remedy has really strong sexual desire, they will go and have sex.

167
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,380
They cannot avoid it.

168
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:08,620
He had a girlfriend, everybody else was going with her except of him.

169
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,620
What is that? We have to understand the situation.

170
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,850
You say strong sexual desire but it is not strong sexual desire.

171
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:28,200
It is a hypotonic desire.

172
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,860
A person who has strong sexual desire, never mind what.

173
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,610
Forget the morals, forget the upbringing, forget the family situations,

174
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:48,310
he will go and have sex. Can you stop a Platina, a Lachesis, an Origanum, it's difficult.

175
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:56,020
Here why you are not impressed by the fact that even his uncle goes with the girl

176
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,270
and he cannot. What is this?

177
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:05,020
It is a desire which is not strong.

178
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,120
This is how I perceive the situation.

179
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,280
-What about Staphysagria in that concept?

180
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:33,270
-Staphysagria is stronger than the situation. Staphysagria also wants idealistic situation.

181
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,620
You know what I mean?

182
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:42,850
I mean a situation where you don't meet a girl in a coffee shop and say, let's go

183
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:49,870
and have sex. This is not an idealistic situation, right? Or it is? Maybe it is.

184
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,280
Idealistic for the Platina but in general it is not.

185
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:06,240
You have to meet somebody, discuss, find out that you like him or like her,

186
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,740
then this can go on for a certain period of time,

187
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,500
for a few months before you know the person, before...

188
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,100
What is sex?

189
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,510
You like these topics?

190
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,600
-Let's go back to the original question.

191
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,850
-Very good.

192
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:47,960
-What are the core elements for prescribing Onosmodium?

193
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:56,750
-Onosmodium, I would prescribe to somebody who is irritable and nervous,

194
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:03,090
who will complain that he cannot have sex, that he was trying to have sex

195
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,170
and he was not able to have an erection.

196
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:23,910
He will try this way and that way, the sex is in his mind but it's much more... trying.

197
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:30,910
Much more realistic in his attitude towards sex.

198
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:43,420
He is somebody who is either too hysterical, too neurasthenic, somebody

199
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,890
who complains for little things, who tries to have sex and he cannot.

200
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:57,140
And then he is fixed in his mind, I must have sex. It is very important to have sex

201
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,780
and he tries again and has no erection. This is a whole situation all together.

202
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:13,330
-What about the question?
-What is sex?

203
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:33,080
When I teach I have to give some standards of what is natural, what is physiological.

204
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:43,980
Here sex is one of the instincts that produce disease and therefore it's important.

205
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,490
Frustration on sexual matters is one of the main causes of producing disease.

206
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:59,070
Frustration on the instinct of survival produces disease.

207
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,560
In order to survive, I need that space. If I don't have it, I'm stressed

208
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:12,290
and therefore I need some space, I need some basic food and some basic water to drink.

209
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,740
This is the instinct of survival. If this in conflict...

210
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,730
I lost my job, my boss told me you can not anymore have a job

211
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:25,980
and I have three children to feed. This is a frustration on instinct of survival.

212
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,480
Frustration on this instinct is going to produce disease.

213
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,070
Frustration on sex and emotional matters is going to produce disease.

214
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:43,900
And I have said now, in our days frustration on spiritual matters it's going to produce disease.

215
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:51,560
For past societies frustration on sexual matters and frustration on instinctual matters...

216
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,160
First on survival matters was very important.

217
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,310
Survival matters was on the older periods. Then we could see diseases

218
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:13,630
because of that frustration and diseases were coming mostly on the physical body.

219
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:20,810
Then as the sexual pleasure took over...

220
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:48,510
As we were satisfied with what we had to eat and we had a lot of sex

221
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:58,250
and any sex we like etc., then the question of spiritual survival came into being.

222
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:03,270
Spiritual survival is now for our society one of the main reasons

223
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:09,750
for bringing up symptomatology, for bringing up diseases.

224
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:14,110
The subtler we do, the subtler diseases are produced.

225
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:24,340
Subtle we say into mental-emotional pictures, so frustration on spiritual levels

226
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,690
produce very deep diseases.

227
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,090
But in all these matters we have to know what is normal.

228
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:38,170
What is normal, how much space you want?

229
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:43,570
I want one factory. All right have one factory.

230
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:48,070
I want two factories, I want a chain of factories, I want... It goes on.

231
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,910
This is disease, it's going towards disease.

232
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,010
How much sex you want?

233
00:29:54,510 --> 00:30:00,410
Once the week, once every two days, once the day, twice the day, three times the day...

234
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:07,320
Where is the natural? There are some spaces of what is natural.

235
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:15,660
Within that context grossly speaking, we have to understand what is sex.

236
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:24,250
What is the normal condition of sex. The doctor has to understand these issues.

237
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:33,910
This is my question. Under these circumstances I ask what is sex.

238
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:47,650
Sex is the urge of the human being, because they represent one pole, to unite with another

239
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,770
and become a unity, become one.

240
00:30:52,260 --> 00:31:02,260
It is the idea of becoming from something which is not whole, to become whole.

241
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,410
That is why the satisfaction comes. The satisfaction does not come

242
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:07,070
because you have an orgasm.

243
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:12,330
The satisfaction comes in sex when you feel really united with the other person.

244
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:17,660
How to feel that? If you are not feeling that, the pleasure is very little.

245
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,500
You feel that unification, the pleasure is great.

246
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:30,000
That's the urge, the urge to become one. Not to be separated, not to be alone.

247
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:39,500
Unless we create that situation, it's very difficult to have this feeling.

248
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:46,620
Never mind how beautiful a woman is, when she lies in bed she is the same like every other woman.

249
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,980
Men know that. It's exactly the same.

250
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,650
So what makes the difference? You say I want this woman?

251
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:03,900
But she is the same with another, she left you, it doesn't matter. Find another one and...

252
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,570
What is this? It is because he felt with this woman this kind of unification,

253
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:17,410
this kind of tremendous losing yourself into somebody else.

254
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:28,660
This circumstance is the natural state of things.

255
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:36,170
I state very crudely these issues, I understand. But I do not have time.

256
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:47,680
We could discuss this matter for five weeks but I want to give you my perspective in a nutshell.

257
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,230
When this is frustrated, then you go to sex and Platina goes to sex.

258
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:59,750
It's not Platina only, it's all the remedies. Nux vomica is worse, I'm telling you.

259
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:05,140
If you go to this kind, you frustrate this element.

260
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,750
By frustration you create a disease.

261
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,650
A man or a woman will say, especially a woman, even when they are 24-25,

262
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,090
they will say still I have not found the right man.

263
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:39,570
And you have to pass a judgment whether this is a frustration or whether this is a natural feeling.

264
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,230
A woman cannot just go to bed and open her legs and have sex.

265
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:49,730
This is not natural for a woman. The woman is more sensitive to perception

266
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:59,970
because she receives inside her, she receives the other person, so she is more sensitive than men.

267
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:05,060
And therefore she resists more, she says I don't want to have sex with you, forget it.

268
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:13,720
Once she is in good health, if she loses her health, then she can do anything

269
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:20,060
and then why do we find all these Sepias and...

270
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:28,070
...and the uterus of Sepia is in atony.

271
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:38,050
She goes to labor and the uterus makes the spasm but it does not bring out the child

272
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,420
and then she collapses.

273
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:50,660
Why? Because there is a frustration, maybe.

274
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,850
When I look upon a case, I look upon a case with a background.

275
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:17,050
I don't look at a case and I don't know anything.

276
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,860
I know certain things and according to these things I understand what is happening.

277
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:31,210
I do not criticize, I do not say, you are frustrated...

278
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:39,350
No, I try to help them. I understand first where is the problem and then I try to help.

279
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:44,600
I understand this man totally, what is the problem with him?

280
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,180
He is a human being who also tries in the scale of evolution

281
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,180
and he is going to evolve according to his...

282
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,120
and I'm called upon certain historical moment in his life to help.

283
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:04,940
Really to help, not to make upside downs and this is the idea with Homeopathy.

284
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,780
We have the possibility to help, help him correctly.

285
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,120
That is the whole idea behind it.

286
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:28,100
So in order the sex to be really enjoyable it has to have that element, mentally,

287
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:39,850
emotionally and spiritually and physically there is no resistance, one is merged in other.

288
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:48,350
If there is no resistance only physically but spiritually or mentally...

289
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:53,350
you can still have an orgasm and remember yesterday you were having an orgasm

290
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:59,950
with the other one and you compare, which is the better. She was better.

291
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:06,850
You are not there, you are not merging because you are able to think other things

292
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:12,860
while you are having sex. That means emotionally or mentally you are not in tune.

293
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,180
The pleasure is going to be much, much less.

294
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,690
The more in tune you are, the more you let yourself.

295
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:23,680
Therefore you are not afraid, you let yourself to merge with the other person,

296
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:32,370
the more you manifest the idea of one and the more pleasure you have.

297
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,600
And that is natural sex.

298
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,530
But what especially the American society is doing...

299
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:49,430
The child is 14 years old and it does not have a boyfriend or a girlfriend. What is wrong?

300
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:55,490
What is wrong in the head of the parents? Not in the child.

301
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,190
The wrong is in the parents head, not in the child.

302
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:06,020
The child is natural, it says I don't want that yet.

303
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:31,220
If children were educated to understand these meanings and to understand

304
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,570
that it's going to be a day that they will enjoy really, they would wait.

305
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:45,220
There are some children who say I can't wait. You say OK, come here, discuss the matter,

306
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:52,810
take Lachesis and then he waits, take Platina and then he waits.

307
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:58,640
And then it becomes a society, which is sane society.

308
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:05,140
Our societies are insane societies and that's why insanity

309
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:13,130
is coming into our beings more and more and more and more.

310
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:29,610
You will say I'm a weak man, a weak woman, I have problems.

311
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:35,610
It's OK, as long as you know that you are a weak man and you have this particular weakness

312
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:40,210
but don't present your weakness as your main point of reference.
