1
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:32,160
-You took Nat. mur. 50M on Friday afternoon.

2
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:44,640
-And about 20 min. afterwards my back pain was about 60-70% better and the back was

3
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:52,640
getting better on Saturday before noon it was getting better hour by hour...

4
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:02,150
Then it was stable and on Monday morning it got better again so that after Monday

5
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,890
it was being like 95% better.

6
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:13,750
Yesterday it was a slight aggravation again but together with some grief coming up.

7
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:27,650
Saturday I realized that I was much more sensitive to the sun and also to salt.

8
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,500
I had aversion to the salt of the sea, I got nausea.

9
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,400
-From going to the sea?
-Yes, I was swimming.

10
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:48,140
After swimming the back was a little bit worse and my hands smell so much salty,

11
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,990
although I had showered and it made me nauseous.

12
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:07,900
Saturday morning I was really angry. Not towards a person or circumstance

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,500
but just it was coming out.

14
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,180
-Anger which was against yourself or against anybody?

15
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:25,150
-No, just anger towards anybody. I realized that I was starting to allow myself

16
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,990
to have a bad mood which I didn't before, I was always trying to be nice.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,730
Yesterday it was interesting because during these days I had talked with several people

18
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:49,680
and they asked how I was doing on psychological level also and I told them what I said

19
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,680
now also and they said, it's good for you and it's good for your marriage also.

20
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:02,030
And I had this same talk in German, in English and yesterday in Swedish.

21
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:12,930
I was born in Sweden and after this talk in Swedish I was really angry again.

22
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:21,930
It was coming up very much anger, so I was astonished why? I had exactly the same talk

23
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,980
just the language was different.

24
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,200
-What was your conclusion? Why the anger came?

25
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:46,640
-I found out after that, grief came up, that I didn't think before it was a grief situation.

26
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:53,500
That was the fact that when I was 13 years old, I had to move from Sweden to Austria.

27
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:01,390
My family was moving down to Austria, which was a hard time for me, it was a terrible

28
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:06,490
situation for me; I didn't like it. I didn't like the language also.

29
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,650
-The German language you mean?
-Yes, in some way I still don't.

30
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:18,530
I like the Swedish language much more but I'm still astonished, a lot of grief and pain

31
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:26,630
came up from this situation and I'm still astonished that this has such an impact.

32
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:39,280
But this age at 13 was the time when I had a major outbreak, I had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis

33
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,880
since 8 years of age.

34
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:50,860
When I was 13 there was a major outbreak with an infection and I was 3 1/2 months in hospital

35
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,710
and got a lot of cortisone, masses of cortisone.

36
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:02,970
After that, what I told you, the shaking, the stiffness of neck got really started.

37
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:15,120
My insecurity and timidity was there before and so this night I wake up again and

38
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:26,330
I was thinking further back to a point when I was 6 years old.

39
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:37,650
I had a bicycle accident when I was 6 years old and I always thought that this was kind of

40
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:44,500
the beginning of my social phobia, this insecurity in public.

41
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,350
I was going downhill with the bicycle and something came towards me and I was going

42
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,420
away with the head...

43
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:11,630
I had a brain concussion, I was unconscious and after that incident I started, when I would go to

44
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:21,290
children's parties, I would get strong nausea whenever we were beginning to eat.

45
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,040
At that point I would say, I feel so bad, I want to go home.

46
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:39,190
After that I started to avoid the parties and my parents told me that I was timid before that

47
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,280
but I'm not sure about it.

48
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:54,170
For me this was starting point and then tonight there was another thing coming up,

49
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,520
which is rather strange.

50
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:09,210
When I was in hospital with this knee infection, in the time of recovery, I had two dreams

51
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,810
which were in awakening state.

52
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:20,360
I wasn't sleeping but I was awake and those were really terrible dreams.

53
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,610
And I've been thinking about those dreams for a while and also during the treatment

54
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:34,790
that I have now, since 1995, after one remedy these dreams came back.

55
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:43,190
I was drinking tea in the evening and couldn't sleep and after work the next day

56
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:49,190
I went to sleep for 1 hour and waking up I was in this dream state again.

57
00:07:51,320 --> 00:08:02,440
This state is so terrible that I know if it wouldn't have stopped, I would have shoot myself.

58
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,540
If I had a revolver in my home.

59
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:18,700
-During that dream state you feel so bad that you can not tolerate it for more than few minutes?

60
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:28,440
-I woke up and I was in that dream state and I run out to the kitchen and put water on my face

61
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,040
and ate an apple and got out of it.

62
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,710
Maybe I will tell you those 2 dreams.

63
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,900
-Originally was the same dream as the one that you are going to say?

64
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,860
-Yes. It was one of those two dreams.

65
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:56,860
When I was in hospital, when I was 13 years old, I had the feeling that I was a big

66
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:10,290
balloon and I was floating towards the city. And the buildings were like peaks...

67
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,270
-To break the balloon?

68
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,370
-Yes, and it was like threatening that if I go down there...

69
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,630
This was the first dream.

70
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:30,280
-That is when you were 13 in Sweden or in Austria?

71
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:40,520
-That was first or second  year in Austria. I was awake and I wanted to call the nurse

72
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,120
but I couldn't call.

73
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:59,470
The other dream doesn't have sequence of action. It's just a state or feeling that I always try to

74
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:08,720
describe it to myself and the best way I can describe it is this:

75
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,570
If you have a mathematical equation and you can't solve it, it's unsolvable.

76
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,410
That's how I can describe it in another way.

77
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:31,560
But that was the state that came back and this is so terrible and even when I was telling this

78
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:38,910
to my homeopath, when at first was trying to think about it, I would come back to that state again.

79
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,160
Now I think something happened tonight.

80
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,990
Maybe I'm not affected so much by it.

81
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,140
-That is the last time that you see it.

82
00:10:48,240 --> 00:11:00,890
-Yes and what I tried to reason up, what is this about, one explanation that I came up with,

83
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,990
which I don't know if it's true or not, is that it has to do maybe with the accident.

84
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:15,390
Maybe these two dreams have to do with what I experienced in this accident going down

85
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,740
with the head and then with the state, I don't know, maybe.

86
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:34,640
-Well, I can give you my idea as somebody who is looking from outside, which is really you felt

87
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:43,390
by going into the new city that this city was so inimical to you that could kill you actually

88
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:50,140
and the moment that you have no protection, you are just alone and you are in that city,

89
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,740
which is full of spikes can just blow the balloon.

90
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:05,810
This is very characteristic of the state, of the sensitivity on which you were and the feelings

91
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:12,560
that you had when you were in the new city and also the second dream is a dead end,

92
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,660
you can not solve.

93
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,570
You are in a new city, you can do nothing.

94
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:23,220
You are going to stay there, you don't like it but you are going to stay there, it's a dead end.

95
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,280
But what I wanted to know is, did you cry at all these days?

96
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:38,420
-No. There was all the time very slight sadness coming up but I didn't cry.

97
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:48,950
-In the near future you will have an opportunity, something will touch you

98
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,020
and you may have to cry and ...

99
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:04,170
But it is very interesting what you are saying, especially the dreams and the state which

100
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,770
comes back as a pathology.

101
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:13,520
It is like a pathology which happened during that time and came back as an old symptom returning.

102
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:27,600
Anything more that you noticed?

103
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:38,700
-Maybe a slight more perspiration all over the body. Maybe it's also because of the heat.

104
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,670
-What about the eruptions around the genitals?

105
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:56,830
-I have noticed no change and I don't even know if these tissues are going to recover ever

106
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,180
because this is also wide.

107
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,020
-OK, thank you.

108
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:37,190
-This is an example of a case where we have an acute which fits also the chronic state.

109
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,690
The same remedy is indicated in both acute and chronic states.

110
00:14:49,190 --> 00:15:00,450
The idea is now that he has to allow this remedy to go on without further interference.

111
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:16,590
That's the one. The second is concerning what we have been talking already that in his case,

112
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:32,680
there are certain psychological states which can be described in different ways.

113
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:39,930
If, for instance, you take down his case and you look for the symptoms, what symptoms

114
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,250
you are going to write down?

115
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:55,530
It is important to see whether you describe well, correctly the feelings that he has.

116
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:06,250
You see the difficulty already, if you want to describe a symptom. It's not easy.

117
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:19,940
Another dilemma that we will have is this.

118
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:36,940
The dreams, which he has, do they belong to Nat. mur. or belong to a general idea?

119
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:49,510
Can you say that dreams of being a balloon is a dream of Nat. mur. or can you say that

120
00:16:49,610 --> 00:17:01,760
the dreams which depict that the individual is in a very sensitive state, dreams of being in danger,

121
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,760
of being killed perhaps, that would be better?

122
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:15,360
You see the difference when you want to write down his symptoms?

123
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,110
What are you going to write down?

124
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,340
If you write dreams of being a balloon is not enough.

125
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:41,680
Dreams of being in danger is not enough. What actually said is, I felt threatened by this new town

126
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:50,850
in which they put me and that was a terrifying experience, that this town was so inimical

127
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:56,690
that all the buildings have spikes that could blow me up.

128
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:07,860
But there is another new symptom which is much more easy to describe.

129
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:19,530
When we took his case, do you like salt? He says, no. I don't like salt. Why?

130
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:30,010
Because his organism receives salt with every substance he takes.

131
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,760
Anything, any food contains some salt, the organism absorbs it.

132
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:43,260
The moment you give more, then the organism is overwhelmed and he feels a salty taste

133
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,110
in his hands.

134
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:56,500
That is a symptom definitely, the way he described it exactly, you can write it down

135
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,350
as a new symptom for Nat. mur.

136
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:07,640
Because that is why we have in Nat. mur. desire but also aversion to salt.

137
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:20,610
And that one time, maybe not now, we talk about the primary and secondary action of the remedies.

138
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:30,360
This is a condition in which we have a secondary action of the remedy.

139
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:51,180
If he allows and does not interfere with any other remedy, then the real benefit of this remedy

140
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,520
will be shown in 6 months.

141
00:19:55,030 --> 00:20:03,320
That is why it is important for you to understand that you have to wait, wait and observe

142
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,670
the changes.

143
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:16,330
He is going to cry because he did not cry most probably at the age of 6, of 13.

144
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:24,870
Now what was happening? All this grief was changing the chemistry of the body.

145
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:32,090
And grief always is a matter of chemistry.

146
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:46,980
It has an initiation because of a psychological event but this initiation brought about

147
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:54,390
chemical change in the body and the body keeps on the wrong chemistry

148
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,580
and keeps up the depression.

149
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:06,570
So depression and all the symptoms they have their equivalent into the body.

150
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:27,830
-Last September you took Nat. mur. 50M. What happened?

151
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:40,430
-I had the first follow up, a few days after, where I told you that a grief had come up from

152
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:51,990
the past and I had quite strong emotional pain for 3 days, after that, I felt it very strong.

153
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,910
-Mostly on the solar plexus?

154
00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:10,140
-Yes and then one night I was crying out to know, because I still couldn't understand why I'm moving

155
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,910
from one country to the other, which was the cause of the grief.

156
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:23,890
Why that would affect me so much? So one night I was just crying out to know what happened

157
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:33,090
and in the moment I cried it was like a curtain was rolling down and the whole thing closed down.

158
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:43,410
After that the pain vanished which was strange because the pain was quite strong.

159
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:53,090
-If I understand well because I have a problem with your English pronunciation, you had

160
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,410
this grief in the past?

161
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:08,810
-The situation was that after the Nat. mur. I had a conversation in Swedish, I grew up in Sweden,

162
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:28,560
I was born there and after that I felt a lot of anger and grief coming up and somehow I realized that

163
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:36,060
this grief was about the fact that I had to move from Sweden to Austria with my family when

164
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:46,160
I was 13 years old and I told you 2 dreams and you interpreted those dreams.

165
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:55,660
But still I didn't understand why moving from one country to another would be so painful?

166
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,410
After that I didn't have much emotional pain.

167
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:12,160
-Which after that? After that night when you spoke and you cried?

168
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:19,730
-I just cried up to god to know why this would cause so much grief and

169
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,810
what this grief was all about?

170
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:30,810
I didn't understand why moving from Sweden to Austria would affect my life so much

171
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:37,810
and then it was like a curtain rolled down and the whole thing closed down.

172
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:46,160
So I didn't see anything. The pain vanished so it was OK for me.

173
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,660
Maybe I will tell you the main things.

174
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:03,260
When I was going back to Austria there wasn't a clear aggravation, there was a symptom

175
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,910
that I haven't told you yet.

176
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:12,230
-For you back pain you mean?
-No, back pain was OK.

177
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:21,580
-It was gone already by the time you left Alonissos?

178
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,920
-Yes, it took 3 days and then everything was OK.

179
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:37,330
I had aggravation symptom. I used to have for some years before that, cramps in the esophagus

180
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:43,830
which would be very peristaltic cramps when I would eat certain foods

181
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:54,530
especially when I was starting eating very fast and be very tense and the foods are

182
00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:05,990
mostly like sour pears, sour apple, red wine, maybe pasta food, spicy food

183
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,340
but not all spicy food.

184
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,180
I'm not really sure what's the common thing with these foods, mostly sour and spicy.

185
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,530
-Will cause a spasm?

186
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:27,890
-I think as if the food gets stuck. I would sit on the table, I would eat, start eating normally,

187
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:36,460
maybe too fast and then the pain will come. I feel the peristaltic movements down here,

188
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:42,990
it's very painful, extremely painful and often I would have to get up from the table

189
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:48,990
and go to the toilet and spit it out because it is very strong pain and then the food

190
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:51,060
would come out with a lot of mucus.

191
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:57,960
There was a strong aggravation of that symptom in the beginning.

192
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:05,460
In the following months that symptom continued in the same frequency and the same intensity

193
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:11,710
but afterwards - I will tell that later - I had a fasting period where it disappeared

194
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:14,640
and since then I haven't had it.

195
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,290
There was a.. which ameliorated it.

196
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:27,530
I had a major dental work done the summer before I took Nat. mur. and after that

197
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:36,280
I had chronic pulpitis in all those teeth which they worked on and I couldn't chew with them

198
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,380
without pain.

199
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:02,290
There was a real amelioration of that, it's still there but I have been taking aspirin

200
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:07,130
for a month and it had become a little bit better.

201
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:17,620
In middle November I've told you about the collagen disease

202
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,470
I have lichen sclerosus e atrophicus.

203
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:24,220
That is a Latin name we use.

204
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,860
-What was the disease?

205
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:45,100
-It is a wide eruption of the glands of the penis where the tissue becomes fibrous

206
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,700
and it shrinks, there is atrophy.

207
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:55,950
As a result of that I had very strong pain when I had erection and coition.

208
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,450
In middle November I looked at my penis and it was gone.

209
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,520
-Just like that?

210
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,520
-Yes, the tissue was back to normal which I wouldn't have thought that it would ever be

211
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:22,620
but after 2-3 weeks it was back to where it was and still is. So it was gone for short time.

212
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:33,370
But it has not been painful since then. I have been able to have coition without pain.

213
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,870
Just maybe a little bit of sourness but not much.

214
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:46,580
Before that the mucus membrane would crack and would have to wait for 1 week to be able to

215
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,760
have coition again because it was so painful.

216
00:29:52,260 --> 00:30:00,160
-Before, you had to wait for a week before you can have again because of the pain?

217
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:09,000
-There was pain during coition but the tissue was shrunk, so with the erection would crack

218
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,090
and would be wounds.

219
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,850
-But not anymore?
-No, no just a little bit sourness.

220
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:29,500
Since the end of the year I discovered white spots here on the forehead between the eyebrows

221
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:41,910
which I still have some of them and then in December and January I developed strong craving

222
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,340
for chocolate.

223
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,850
I was waking up in the morning and the first thought I had was how do I get a chocolate today?

224
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,630
And at the same time a craving for sex.

225
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,640
-In the morning?
-No, any time.

226
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:17,760
It was pretty strong. In February I started a fasting period where I was for the first 3 days

227
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:25,110
just with water and then 40 days with partial fast, leaving out one meal the day

228
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:31,510
and of course then I didn't concentrate on sex and chocolate because I didn't eat

229
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,140
chocolate at that time.

230
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,510
What was really striking to me was how well I felt during this fasting period.

231
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,860
It was like first time in my life that I felt that I had energy to do things.

232
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:58,590
Before I always knew I wanted to do things but I always knew I had very little energy

233
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:02,850
to do things, I was living on reserve energy.

234
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,690
But this was incredible, I knew I can do it.

235
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
-Very good.

236
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:20,430
-Also in that time the esophagus cramps vanished and after that I haven't really had them.

237
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:22,200
Maybe a little bit only.

238
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:36,700
What happened after the fasting in May, I had two episodes of hiccup for 1 1/2 day.

239
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,090
First time I've been in a Chinese restaurant with spicy food.

240
00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:51,090
Second time it was in a Turkish restaurant also with spicy food and there would be

241
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:54,440
a constant hiccup.

242
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:02,940
It would be for 2 1/2 days and it would merely stopped for little while

243
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:11,700
and then it would come again and it was connected with the food I ate.

244
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:36,850
Especially the second time there were some eructations also and I would have an eructation

245
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,200
and the hiccup would start.

246
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:44,450
Also when the hiccup was there, the acid would thrown up to the esophagus.

247
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:53,850
First time it was connected with a cough, when I would cough, it would start also but

248
00:33:53,950 --> 00:34:00,200
it was pretty strong hiccup, I don't know if I should describe this more in details.

249
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,230
I've never had it since then.

250
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:17,940
My main complains have always been and still is my inability to move in company

251
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,290
and in public.

252
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,270
-Still aversion to company?

253
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:28,350
-I don't really have aversion company. I don't have aversion to people or company but

254
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:35,770
there is a great fear and cramping in company, especially in front of people when

255
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:42,850
attention is directing towards me, which I had since my childhood?

256
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:52,100
-Yes, but how is that in comparison? Do you see any changes, 10 or 20%?

257
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:56,600
-Yes, I would say before I came to Alonissos it was 10% better.

258
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:04,190
Being here in Alonissos is even better, maybe 20% but how can I evaluate it?

259
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:09,040
People have told me that I have changed and I think so.

260
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:24,600
-Your timidity, you would say is 20% better, something like that?

261
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:35,350
-Maybe 20%. I'm a little bit more relaxed in company. Maybe I should tell you

262
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:43,940
the way I would describe it before Nat. mur. I read what you said about Nat. mur.

263
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:54,600
You said fear of being hurt, that fits very well. Sometimes I thought I don't go into

264
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,700
company because I want to avoid of getting hurt.

265
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:11,220
And also this constant self awareness you say. Maybe I can describe it like if I would

266
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:18,470
be sitting in a café and reading a book on a table and several people sitting around

267
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:25,470
when I would turn the page in the book, I would be thinking that I'd had to turn this page

268
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:33,220
in a way that none around can say I did it in the wrong way. One woman would be looking probably.

269
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:39,420
That was very strong and also like if I would cross a place with other people

270
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:48,150
I would think I have to put this page in a way that none can say I did it wrong.

271
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:53,710
That was very strong and was very sick and tormenting also.

272
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,280
-How is that?
-It's better.

273
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:03,780
-How much?
-I'm not sure.

274
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,710
It's more than 15%, maybe 18%.

275
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:25,860
What has become stronger is the emotional pain. What happened after the Nat. mur.

276
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,610
when I was sitting in the class and they were follow ups, I could hardly stand it because

277
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,110
people when talking about the sufferings, I think especially those who are talking about

278
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:45,610
emotional sufferings, I could hardly stand listening not because of sympathy but

279
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,960
because it reminded me my own pain.

280
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,460
And this happened now again since last Monday.

281
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:02,450
When I came to Alonissos I was perfectly well and happy and optimistic and I'm most of the time.

282
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:08,940
But when the follow up started, I started to feel this pain again and I had a full week

283
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,630
of very strong emotional pain, last week.

284
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:23,310
And I realized that what I mostly do when I get an emotional heat, the way I know how

285
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:29,810
to handle this is to just forget it, don't think about it and as long as I don't think about it

286
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:30,990
I'm perfectly well.

287
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:46,670
But this time I didn't, try to appear nice or happy. So I think maybe that's a good development

288
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:50,670
because I'm getting more in touch with emotions and maybe the mental symptoms

289
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,570
are a little bit better.

290
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:09,720
I have maybe two symptoms that I haven't told you of, yet. I have warts on my sole.

291
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,840
-Many warts?
-Yes.

292
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,310
-Painful?
-No.

293
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:32,310
There are only some left here.
-They were gone by Nat. mur.?

294
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:41,520
-No, I got Thuja before. I got for 1 1/2 year I got Thuja 3 times.

295
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,890
They were gone completely from Thuja and then they came back after Thuja.

296
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,690
Even before the Natrum.

297
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:56,210
-Now after the Natrum came even more or they are the same?

298
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,310
-I think they stayed the same. Maybe a little bit more.

299
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,240
Another strange symptom is that I don't eat sweets after 6 o'clock in the evening

300
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,590
because if I do, I can not sleep.

301
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:26,060
-The aversion to milk is still there?

302
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:40,210
-I don't drink it. There are some minor symptoms which only took a few days which

303
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,960
I can tell you if you need more information.

304
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,310
-Yes.

305
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:51,960
-I had directly after Nat. mur. still here in Alonissos, I had periods of bad hearing

306
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:59,140
especially on the left ear, which I have had in the treatment previous years also very shortly.

307
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:07,910
Then in the beginning of November I had a very short period of an old symptom,

308
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:17,760
which for many years had gone and also during the treatment getting hungry just before going to bed.

309
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:23,340
I would go to bed and get hungry and then I would get up and eat something.

310
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,440
But that was very short.

311
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:33,410
In January I had a period of forgetting what I wanted to say in the process of

312
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,750
concentrating upon something.

313
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:50,160
My memory has been bad since a cannabis indica experience that I had on 87

314
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:59,160
where I drunk a beer which was drugged. I guess it was. I drunk a beer which was dragged

315
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:03,760
and for two weeks afterwards I had Cannabis indica symptoms.

316
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:13,110
I don't know what was in the beer but I had also my memory got worse and the

317
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:18,170
memory is the only symptom that had remained from this experience.

318
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,860
-How much cannabis you took?

319
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:32,250
-I don't know. It was in Athens, I took a beer, I think there was something in there.

320
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,070
-Ah, you think there was something in the beer. You mean in a party?

321
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:56,070
-No. I didn't take voluntarily. It was someone who cheated me, I sat down in Athens

322
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:59,420
to drink a beer with a person I didn't know.

323
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,660
-And he put most probably cannabis and he told you afterwards?

324
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:17,570
-No, no. Then he asked me to go for another beer and actually I didn't want to but

325
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:24,570
somehow I was very strong bond to this person, I thought I have to be polite and I went

326
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:34,570
with him to drink a beer and there when I said I wanted to leave, someone very quickly

327
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:41,830
came and with a new kind of beer and they filled up my glass, which was almost full

328
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,170
and then I took one sip and I was almost gone.

329
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,070
-Unconscious?

330
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:54,910
-Yes, I really had to fight to stay awake after just one sip. So I got out there and

331
00:43:55,010 --> 00:44:05,410
the effect of the second sip of beer of this strong effect stopped after 15 min. but

332
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:15,410
the effect of the first drug took the next day and the day after, on the train from Vienna

333
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:21,410
to Gratz, I realized that I was coming back into myself. I had been away and I was

334
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,010
coming back into myself.

335
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:31,660
The following two weeks when driving to work, I would go out of myself and I would

336
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,260
have to pull myself back again and I have fear of insanity.

337
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:41,500
-With panic state?

338
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:48,330
-No, it was not so strong, I had never had fear of insanity in my life but I know since then

339
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:54,940
how it is and I had fear of going to sleep and also my memory ...

340
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,190
-You lost your memory?
-Yes.

341
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,580
Before I would never had to write anything down, even if you tell me to bring yourself in a year,

342
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,010
I wouldn't write it down but since then I have to.

343
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:27,910
This period with the memory was for one week. That was in January but generally my memory

344
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:31,460
is not as good as it was since this experience.

345
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:36,660
-The Nat. mur. had any effect on your memory?

346
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:47,010
-No, I don't think so but it isn't really strong problem, it's just something that I realize.

347
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:53,610
-Have you finished? I want to ask you some questions.

348
00:45:55,010 --> 00:46:04,410
-I just had a minor flu in December for two days where I had nausea, headaches and vertigo

349
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:07,260
when getting up, which I've never had before.

350
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,010
-Getting up from bed?
-No, from the chair.

351
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,010
-I would like to know about your thirst, how is your thirst?

352
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,350
-My thirst hasn't change.

353
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,660
-Salt?
-No.

354
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:37,380
-Still you don't like salt?
-I don't need it, I don't care much for salt.

355
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:43,510
-The sun how you react?
-I'm still sensitive, the same as before.

356
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,010
-And sweets?

357
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,000
-I think it's still more than before Nat. mur. a little bit more.

358
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:09,750
-Was the position for sleep did it change? You sleep in a different position now?

359
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,510
-No.

360
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:15,480
-Do you sleep right through the night or you wake up?

361
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,870
-My sleep is better.

362
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:23,830
-And it's more refreshing now?
-Yes, I guess so.

363
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:28,830
Mostly my sleep problems would be when I was nervous that I wouldn't

364
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:32,350
sleep well. I think that's a little bit better.

365
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:46,100
-The remedy from which pharmacy you took?
-The Nat. mur. I got from here.

366
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:57,750
-OK, what we have to do is just to wait.

367
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:06,500
Don't drink coffee of course and take other medication and I believe you may see

368
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:11,680
in the long run complete change, in a year.
