1
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,950
-What is the problem?

2
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:38,590
-My problem is very much tiredness and often sleeplessness during the night.

3
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:44,210
In some periods I sleep quite well but never really well.

4
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:52,890
When I go to bed I need at least an hour awake or maybe half an hour before and so on.

5
00:00:52,990 --> 00:01:00,140
Sometimes I sleep until I get up, sometimes I wake up at 4 in the morning

6
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:11,920
and for sure if I haven't slept during the night, I'm very tired during the day.

7
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:20,390
Especially when I'm at work, working as a homeopath, I get very easily tired,

8
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,480
I find it difficult to consult, especially new consultation.

9
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:42,230
I feel deeply exhausted, I would say more physically in that case, more tired.

10
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:49,300
And I don't find I have problems in thinking, reading but I just feel tired

11
00:01:53,910 --> 00:02:03,050
and also I realize that if I eat, I get very tired afterwards.

12
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:08,300
Sometimes if I eat my lunch and I have a consultation afterwards,

13
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,900
especially if it is a difficult patient, where I don't see any remedy,

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,640
because if I see something, then I get excited and then it's OK because I'm more alert.

15
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:26,140
But if I find it difficult, sometimes I get so tired.

16
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:39,150
Especially at 3-4 o'clock in the afternoon I hate to have new patients

17
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,980
after let's say 2 o'clock because I feel so tired.

18
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:52,140
So I try to put my patients, the new ones, earlier in the day like at 10 o'clock

19
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,990
and not later than 2 o'clock.

20
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:05,990
When I go home I feel the need for at least half an hour sleep but very often

21
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:15,390
when I want to sleep during the day, it takes me some time until I fall asleep

22
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,990
and then I wake up after 15-20 minutes.

23
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,380
If I sleep well, I take a cup of coffee and then I'm OK usually

24
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,490
but sometimes I can get tired after that.

25
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,880
Especially those nights that I have problems to fall asleep like last spring,

26
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:51,390
my feet get very hot and sometimes I find it hard to spread my feet with cold

27
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:57,890
because it's so hot but that's not usual because right now it hasn't been like that at all

28
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:04,740
but for some periods of time my feet get very hot during night. I'm very restless.

29
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:15,300
I can't stand still, I have to move constantly all the time and I always have...

30
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,800
I can't stop doing it, except if I know about it, when I'm aware of it.

31
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,150
So I'm very restless in body.

32
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,160
-He needs Zinc.
-I thought about that.

33
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:43,060
I always had a lumbago which usually I don't have sciatica things but sometimes,

34
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:49,550
especially now because I got an acute lumbago and I don't want to go in the weekend

35
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:56,300
and I go to the chiropractic and I had three treatments, now it's getting better now.

36
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,800
But now I have this sciatic thing down my leg.

37
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,770
-Which side, left side?

38
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,540
-Now it is the left but I think that's because of the chiropractic treatment.

39
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:37,320
Also I find a pain up here, I get very tight up here but I think that doesn't bother me usually

40
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:44,140
and sometimes I wonder if that actually has been more often after I've been to the chiropractic.

41
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,760
I went to the chiropractic first time in 82.

42
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:55,790
I always had bad migrains that disappeared when I was aware until 82

43
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,900
because it was the autumn you were here the first time.

44
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:29,380
I've been driving a lot of taxi during my studies and I think my back is from the taxi driving.

45
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:46,380
I can't think of anything special except that I can get some background if you want.

46
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,040
I have a fear when I was doing quite a bit of drugs.

47
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,210
-What drugs?

48
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:12,860
-A little bit of amphetamine, cocaine a few times but not many times, maybe 5-6-7 times.

49
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,110
When I was at 20 I used to get a lot of barbiturates.

50
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:39,550
I think I wanted contact but I was very closed person and then I used these barbiturates

51
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,700
because they gave me a kind of self-confidence.

52
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:52,690
When I did that, I did quite a bit for a year, one and a half year but when I finished that

53
00:07:52,790 --> 00:08:02,670
I took LSD once, some marihuana but not very much because also I had a lot of anxiety,

54
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,690
so I didn't want it.

55
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,940
-Marihuana is the cannabis indica?
-Yes.

56
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:23,950
-Except that LSD experience it was very good the first 5-6 hours, then I had 6 hours of nothing,

57
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,580
it was very bad and I think I had some kind of shock after it.

58
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:35,840
Since then I've been in very good care, I've been travelling a bit after that

59
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,670
and I've been feeling very good until I think it started in 1983.

60
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,170
Like I said I was very insecure and I didn't know what to do.

61
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,510
I went to University to study but I wasn't very sure what I wanted to do,

62
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,010
I have no motivation of going there.

63
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:07,000
I started travelling a bit and I got to a religious group, a Christian group in 1977

64
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:18,120
and when I came back, when I finished that I felt that it wasn't what I believed or hoped it could be.

65
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:27,330
I was looking to a religious experience or at least something to hold on

66
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,580
and I couldn't find anything.

67
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,340
When I came home I was really depressed and I was seriously thinking of committing suicide

68
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,680
and I think for about half a year I was very depressed.

69
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:53,340
At the end I came to a point where I had either to commit suicide or I had to do something

70
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,780
with my life and I decided I had to do something with my life.

71
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,960
I went to the University, I studied philosophy and I then I went into contact

72
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:09,340
with one of the people here, studying natural medicine, and I think from that point I decided

73
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,190
that I'm going to do something with my life...

74
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:25,580
I think I always have had had some mental energy, not that it bothered me

75
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:34,850
but when I got very weak especially if it was very warm in the summer but nothing very much

76
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:41,200
until when I studied Homeopathy.

77
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:57,270
Then I was driving a lot of bus which was very exhausting

78
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,110
and I had a lot of tension in my stomach.

79
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:13,090
I had anxiety about health because when I had all the stomach pains in the driving

80
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,440
I was wondering of this.

81
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:29,890
I can get it sometimes these years when I'm very depressed; also I can get it here

82
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:44,410
when I have pressure and I'm very tensed in the solar plexus.

83
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:54,570
If you want to know my desire, I desire sweets, especially in the evening

84
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,310
but during the day I don't have any desire for chocolate but very often in the evening

85
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,220
I got anything in there.

86
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,300
Also one thing I forgot to mention I have a tendency to low blood sugar.

87
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,800
I've been taking this 6 hours blood test and that was quite normal but I find that

88
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:20,050
if I drink coffee and I drink not much coffee but not more than a couple of cups the day,

89
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,050
that gives me energy at least for a little while.

90
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:31,970
But I found that if I drink coffee, especially if I have lunch, before 4 o'clock

91
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:44,720
I start to feel very weak and trembling, not very much and I feel very weak and low in energy.

92
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:55,560
My blood sugar when I feel that it's been very low around 2.5.

93
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:03,310
But like I told if I'm fasting, if I go a day and not getting breakfast,

94
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,790
I can go the whole day without eating.

95
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:15,640
This doesn't do me anything but if I drink coffee, then I think it's low blood sugar.

96
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,150
I was quite irritable but I don't think I'm that much irritable anymore.

97
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:49,300
But we had a discussion the other day, the things I don't like is when people contradict me

98
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,230
or they disagree with me, I can get quite tensed from that.

99
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:05,130
-You are not supposed to react in this way. You are observers, we are not criticizing

100
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,740
what we are seeing.

101
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,160
If you are taking a case and you are going to prescribe,

102
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:19,130
so you will have the responsibility with somebody else, so if you observe

103
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,880
and you don't know what is going on, you don't laugh so easily.

104
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:33,650
Also if you laugh, it means that you take a critical attitude towards what you hear.

105
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:46,560
Now of course you are doing it because you are not really responsible but never mind

106
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:57,630
how much something seems to you it's not right or it is different etc. still you observe

107
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:04,630
and you wait until you find really what is going on.

108
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,880
What he is saying is important information if you say, I used to be irritable, now I'm not.

109
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,730
For me it's very important information that tells me a lot of things, a lot of stories.

110
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:27,230
-Also I sigh a lot, my girlfriend tells me I do it all the time.

111
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,210
-What remedies have you taken?

112
00:15:52,980 --> 00:16:34,240
-I have taken Lycopodium, Hydrophobinum that was two years ago, I took Medorrhinum...

113
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:08,000
-I was very Christian and I took Staphysagria, it didn't have an effect

114
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:28,840
and I took Ignatia 200, I took Tuberculinum and I feel quite confident that it did something.

115
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:44,540
Then another homeopath gave me Cannabis indica and Ambra grisea, then also Arsenicum

116
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:57,840
and then on thinking myself I took Natrum sulphuricum 1M.

117
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:14,420
Sometimes I thought about Aurum because I feel I'm too much Aurum the way you described Aurum

118
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,520
and I have some tendency to think about suicide.

119
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,850
-Why?

120
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:46,240
-Sometimes I feel not so much anymore but earlier I felt that life is heavy.

121
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,420
-Why life is heavy?

122
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:59,660
-You have to fight all the time, very many times I'm thinking that life is a fight.

123
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:08,770
-But you fight for what reason?
-How can I explain that?

124
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:24,190
-Life is a fight because... tell me what it is in you that makes life seems so heavy for you?

125
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:29,520
-Not anymore because I feel I have found...

126
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,270
If you ask me now if I'm thinking of committing suicide,

127
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:41,960
I would say no because was thinking very long to do it and I had that depression

128
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:49,460
but I don't think that way, like before.

129
00:19:53,210 --> 00:20:03,020
-Which area is the most difficult for you? It's the area of your work, finances,

130
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:09,530
your relationship with your parents, your relationship with the girls, the relationship?

131
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:19,610
-It's vague I would say, work is difficult but I know it is and I have difficult finance

132
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:38,270
and it worries me a lot because we have problems and... we manage but it's like, it's difficult.

133
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:49,120
I think it's all in the back of my mind but I don't have that kind of attitude anymore.

134
00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:04,520
I think it can be all this tiredness and I told you back in 82 I had some fears,

135
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,520
where I just felt...

136
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:23,600
If I had that, I would be 100% because I felt what I was doing was right, I was happy.

137
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,440
-What remedy you have taken then?
-Nothing.

138
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:41,220
-You had not started with Homeopathy?
-No, I started in 80.

139
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:50,290
-Are you sure it was not because of the remedy that you were feeling...?

140
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,280
Do you remember when did you take Sulphur?

141
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,540
-I took Sulphur afterwards, I took Sulphur that summer that I was working in a tourist shop.

142
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,790
I was very weak because of the heat and I couldn't believe it's so hot,

143
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:13,120
it was down to 40-44.

144
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,120
Also my blood pressure was down, I think it was tested the other day

145
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,570
and it was 6-9 or something quite low.

146
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:43,560
That was the summer in 83. Also that summer I hit a person on the road, it was killed.

147
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:50,710
That was before taking Sulphur. I was driving and then he went out to the red light

148
00:22:50,810 --> 00:23:00,960
and she was hit by the car and she died the same night. That was a shock but in a way...

149
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:08,720
for three days I felt terrible but after that I was surprised how I recovered.

150
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:18,350
I thought it must be something wrong because I didn't reacted more.

151
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:29,880
It doesn't hurt me but then I know that it wasn't my fault either.

152
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:41,810
I was driving fast but the police didn't find any reason to condemn me.

153
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:05,560
But these problems started before this, so I don't think there was a connection.

154
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,290
-How old are you now?
-32.

155
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,890
-Have you been married before?
-No.

156
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,300
-Why you didn't marry yet?

157
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:42,230
-Probably next year. My girlfriend is sitting up there.

158
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:56,820
-She will owe me something, I will make you confess publically that you marry her.

159
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:13,810
Where is your girlfriend? She will give some information about you.

160
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,460
20 years you know him?
-Yes.

161
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:26,890
-Tell us about his character.

162
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:59,290
-Personally I think he is very tensed, he has developed some ticks,

163
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:05,790
especially when he is in a stress position, he is doing with his fingers like that.

164
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:36,890
Like he said he is also in some discussions, he can be very hard on the others,

165
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,890
sometimes, in some special discussions.

166
00:26:44,400 --> 00:27:04,140
I think also his relationship with his father, he has always been hard in discussions,

167
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,730
he is always been the one who says I'm right.

168
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,230
Perhaps sometimes he can tolerate...

169
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:41,880
-Do you develop fever sometimes?
-Not very often.

170
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,380
-What is your normal temperature?

171
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:56,550
-36.6 but that was a long time since I measure it but I had an infection not this spring,

172
00:27:56,650 --> 00:28:09,480
the spring before and I had 39 but then I didn't have any colds.

173
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:22,960
This summer when I worked as a tourist guide, I developed quite a severe cold with some sinusitis.

174
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:31,360
Last winter I had a cold and I started getting a sore throat and it seemed to me

175
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:43,870
that this will never finish and also if I talk a lot, I feel so tired in my voice

176
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:52,210
and also I feel a tension in my bronchi.

177
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,210
-So you have said everything?

178
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:41,220
-No, the desire, the sexual drive was very high before. That was two or three years ago.

179
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,530
-It was after the accident?
-No, before.

180
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,780
-You were happy before the accident.

181
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:11,370
-I felt in harmony. That's the way I felt.
-Yes but you were taking drugs, amphetamines...

182
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:16,350
-That was in 1977.
-After 77 you didn't take anything?

183
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:20,120
-No.
-But 82 you felt the best.

184
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:30,610
-Yes, very good.
-The first remedy that you took was Medorrhinum?

185
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:49,050
-Yes I think that was the first remedy I took. We had a clinic and we agreed to Lycopodium.

186
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:55,370
Then I took Lycopodium but I also thought about Lycopodium now.

187
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:03,870
I think I took Medorrhinum sometime afterwards but I cannot say exactly when.

188
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:15,020
But I don't think that changed my condition then. Then I was happy.

189
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:28,030
After I got in Homeopathy because I found something to live for and I was very motivated

190
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:33,870
and very interested and I felt that the more I spend in this, the more I can become.

191
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:40,860
I think that was the main motor why I felt so happy because for 10 years I didn't know

192
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,790
what I wanted to do.

193
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,440
-You said that your energy comes up in the evening again?

194
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:54,680
-No, only after sleep and a cup of coffee but if I don't sleep or I don't drink coffee

195
00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:00,790
or even if I drink coffee but I don't sleep, the coffee doesn't seem to help me in anything.

196
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:15,680
-Are you fastidious?
-Yes I'm fastidious.

197
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:24,760
I can get very angry with my girlfriend when we work in the house.

198
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:32,020
It's an old house and we fix it up and I wanted to do it very properly

199
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:40,030
and so on and we got in some argument because she is sloppy when she works on the house

200
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:46,270
and I'm very fastidious on things like that.

201
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:55,350
-But she can fix the house very quickly because she is young.

202
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:04,450
-Sorry I'm so fastidious in this, I get so fed up sometimes because I want it to finish.

203
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,610
-So you took Arsenicum for that?
-Yes.

204
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,840
-Which remedy actually has helped you?

205
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:30,700
-As far as I can see, I hardly notice anything. I mean if someone else observes me...

206
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,950
I cannot say for sure.

207
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:48,100
-You never drank coffee before?

208
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:57,190
-I started drinking coffee only last year, I was drinking quite a bit of tea, a lot of tea before.

209
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:05,780
Now I don't drink that much of tea, then I didn't know anything about tea and Homeopathy.

210
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:18,680
-Do you feel the cold very much?
-To say it that way.

211
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:29,190
I don't freeze that easily, as much as my girlfriend does, but I think I feel the heat more.

212
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:32,190
I don't have tolerance in the heat anymore.

213
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:44,440
It seems to me that I have a tendency to get very weak, if it's hot but then

214
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:50,200
I can't swim in cold water, I don't go to swim anymore

215
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,680
and even in Greece the water is a bit cold.

216
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:01,540
If I stay more than five minutes in the water, I freeze very much.

217
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:15,120
If I sit in a room with more than 25 degrees, I don't like it, I feel awful.

218
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:44,510
-How is your pulse now?
-Now I'm drinking coffee.

219
00:35:44,610 --> 00:36:03,460
-Yes because you are slightly trembling.
-Around 60-65.

220
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:30,660
Sometimes I get pains or I can get chronic pains.

221
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,240
-When you drive the bus? You still drive the bus?

222
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:47,430
-No, I won't do that again because I get very tensed when I drive the bus.

223
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:53,170
I think then it was when the tiredness got so much.

224
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,830
-You lost your voice when you talk much?

225
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:16,510
-Yes, it feels exhausting, if I can say it that way.

226
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:21,270
-You sweat?
-No, I don't sweat.

227
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:45,090
I get headaches but not that much anymore. When I was 20 I had some headaches. I'm not very thirsty.

228
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,500
-Any constipation/diarrhea?

229
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:54,840
-Yes I have the tendency to be constipated, especially last year.

230
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:04,100
When I'm away of home I got constipated.

231
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:10,850
-This is characteristic of Nux vomica, going away from being constipated.

232
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:26,580
-Also it seems that if I'm at home alone, then I relax and I can get desire for stool.

233
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,760
But if there is people around, than I don't.

234
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,010
I have tendency to be constipated.

235
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,930
-How do you sleep, on which position?

236
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:01,000
-Usually on my stomach but lately I started sleeping on my side too. I can't fall asleep on my back.

237
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,840
-Never?

238
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:17,760
-No, my girlfriend told me the other day that I was sleeping on my back but as far as I know, never.

239
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:27,660
At the time I had salivation during sleep. I had it once very rarely

240
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,440
and once in a while I grind my teeth.

241
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:44,210
-Do you have easily hemorrhages or open your nose?

242
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:52,100
-Yes, I often have nose bleeding especially if I have a cold.

243
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,750
-Have you taken Phosphorus?
-Yes.

244
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,470
-When?

245
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:22,970
-I think before the Nat mur, I took first 10M and then I tried 1M.

246
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:35,800
I'm always excited about a remedy, I take a remedy and I think that something is happening.

247
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,310
-I think he is an open person.

248
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:48,810
-If I talk with people I'm open but at the same time I can feel insecure.

249
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,700
-At years at school he would be the one who would stand up and talk

250
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:02,800
and he would be the one in the Committee and anything like that.

251
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:20,630
-Do you like cold drinks or warm drinks?
-Warm drinks.

252
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,420
-Cold drinks bother you?

253
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:32,450
-I would never drink a cold drink in the morning at least but if I'm in Greece...

254
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,560
But I don't have much desire for cold drinks.

255
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:43,700
One thing I didn't mention is during the periods of sleeplessness, a few times I noticed

256
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,620
that I have a kind of...

257
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:58,370
I can't explain, especially in my arms, a kind of aching but it's not pain.

258
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:11,140
I try to stretch. That's something I noticed when I lived in Cyprus for a year.

259
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,710
I was waking up with a kind of aching in my legs.

260
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,140
I always had this kind of restlessness in my body.

261
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:05,290
-When you had the pains in the back, how they were ameliorated?

262
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:08,140
-Mainly by lying down.

263
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:18,870
-Which position?
-It seems that... I don't think any specific.

264
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,870
If I lie down for a while, it gets better because

265
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:31,120
once I lie down that's when I have it acute. I find that if I lie on my back,

266
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:37,300
it's difficult to relax because I'm afraid of the pain when I start to relax.

267
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:54,800
-Mainly where is mostly the weakness? It is mostly on the mental level you would say or physical?

268
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:07,470
-It's not in my thoughts or anything, it's a kind of sleepiness maybe.

269
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:17,730
It's not so much physical. It's a difficult question to answer.

270
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:36,620
I don't find that my thoughts are confused or anything like that, especially if it's very late at

271
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:46,800
night. I want to say something and the other person talks, I suddenly forget what I was going to say.

272
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:55,310
-Was it anytime that you had anemia?
-Not as far as I know.

273
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:20,590
-The picture that he presents is not clear at all. What you feel is weakness, weakness.

274
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:36,740
This case is very difficult when they just feel weak generally without clear cut symptom.

275
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:46,090
We didn't get any symptom actually. What symptom did we get to say this is a symptom?

276
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:55,220
-Weakness especially after 2 o'clock.

277
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:09,230
-Weakness 2-3 o'clock you would say?
-I think at work.

278
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:14,120
-If you don't work, you would have weakness at that time?

279
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,730
-I don't think so, I can't say for sure.

280
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:24,970
-You see? The symptom is not clear, he cannot say for sure.

281
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:39,980
He appears to have some symptoms of Sulphur to my understanding, not confirmed.

282
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:58,230
2-3 is Sulphur and the afternoon is Sulphur but...he is too fastidious for Sulphur.

283
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:05,380
-And cold.

284
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:14,480
-Not extroverted, rather introverted but yet argumentative and intellectual.

285
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:33,300
We could have started with Sulphur, it is an easy solution but he doesn't like it.

286
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:50,300
There is a remedy which has depressed state Acetalinidum acid that lowers temperature,

287
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:57,790
it brings the whole organism very low, the pulse is low, the blood pressure is low, the energy is low.

288
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:20,940
We don't have much information but I have used this remedy once in a similar case,

289
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:28,530
where he described that the pulse is so low and the blood pressure is low

290
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:35,960
and everything has lowered down and with this kind of attitude which looks like Sepia.

291
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:50,290
Or you can think of Sepia mostly, the argumentative kind also

292
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:58,710
and also another possibility is Acetic acid.

293
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:13,200
With the debility and the hemorrhages that he has, the impossibility to sleep on his back.

294
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:19,600
-What about his indifference for the accident?

295
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:28,360
-It is not indifference. He thought he was not responsible.

296
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:37,040
I don't know. He says that he is not affected.

297
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:55,830
He says that his state started before that. If that is true..

298
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:19,280
-I don't think I had that kind of weakness or this tiredness that I had after the accident,

299
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:24,860
that is one thing but it's the firsts time I experienced such...

300
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,130
-After the accident?
-Yes.

301
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:47,080
-I'll tell you what is my problem. What I see here he is a person who has disciplined himself

302
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,440
to behave in this way.

303
00:50:51,420 --> 00:51:01,500
Behind that I see a strong mental attitude, argumentative.

304
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,750
He sits in this way like Staphysagria but he does not have to do with Staphysagria.

305
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:19,160
He talks in a way which is weak but when there is an argument he might be very excited

306
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:26,900
in the argument and also when you talk in certain things, then he comes and says

307
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:34,340
it's not like that. He is not a person that will accept...

308
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,330
It's not what he appears to be finally, that is the problem.

309
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:50,220
There is a strength behind the weakness.

310
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:55,880
He presents a weakness and behind there is a strength.

311
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:05,200
Which remedy is that?
-What about Causticum?

312
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:10,780
-Why?
-To open half.

313
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,880
-Yes but you have to have reasons for giving a remedy. Causticum has what?

314
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:36,780
I don't understand because he has made himself in a way,

315
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,380
he is not with what was naturally growing there.

316
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:55,380
What has happened is that because of the conflict in very big level, he lost his energy.

317
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,540
There is some kind of conflict. Where is the conflict?

318
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:11,450
The conflict is because he feels very argumentative and very aggressive and he says to

319
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:18,200
himself this is not good, you have to be calm and very positive and you have to listen to people.

320
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,560
Is that the conflict? Maybe.

321
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:45,110
Then I'm thinking of what is the remedy. Also what I feel is completely trembling inside,

322
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:53,760
almost like an alcoholic. He is not an alcoholic but bzzz...

323
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,510
-I'm very nervous.

324
00:53:55,610 --> 00:54:04,450
-You are very nervous, you get like that, trembling almost.

325
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:17,280
Maybe this case for instance it can be Tarentula, presenting himself in a completely different way.

326
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:32,010
Do you like arguments? Do you like discussion?

327
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:41,600
-Yes but sometimes I feel that maybe I speak in a complicated way so people

328
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:51,190
don't understand me and I get this tremendous pressure inside but I like an argument.

329
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:57,760
-You like the argument because you think that your ideas are very interesting?

330
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:01,010
-No, no.

331
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:02,610
-Why you like the argument?

332
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:28,370
-If in something I'm right and people contradict me, I feel that they don't...

333
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:43,610
I want an argument like that. I want...

334
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:12,450
-Do you get irritable sometimes? Out of control?
-Yes.

335
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:20,930
-What do you do then?
-If I get angry, I can feel like crying.

336
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:43,110
It's not really crying and at the same time I feel like a hypocrite.

337
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:52,850
I can't get easily angry but I'm very controlling at the same time.

338
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:06,190
When I throw something if I'm angry, I still have much control, I don't throw things out of the window.

339
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:09,790
I throw where I know it will not hurt.

340
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:33,190
-You get more answers. More real answers. He is intellectual with a conflict inside

341
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:37,030
but now where is the conflict?

342
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:55,870
The organism should be going towards a particular direction but he does not allow that.

343
00:57:56,370 --> 00:58:01,690
Yes I would throw the plate but not exactly that, I will throw it to the left side, not to the right.

344
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:10,940
All this is mentalised reaction. Reactions which try to control it.

345
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:21,850
-He does not like the summer.

346
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:27,940
-I like the summer but I don't feel well because of the heat.

347
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:44,700
-It's a symptom. But why?

348
00:58:50,440 --> 00:59:06,340
-I think the reason why he is doing like that is because he is he felt inferior

349
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:14,080
because he was never allowed to express I'm right and therefore often he gets into these arguments.

350
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:20,090
It has been a couple of times where he can be furious over a small thing

351
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:30,140
and I feel that he is never able to say I'm right in my arguments and I'm wrong.

352
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:56,930
-I think you picked him because you wanted a demonstration of intellectual dropping.

353
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:09,600
-No. Actually he came in to take the case and when he told me about a few things,

354
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:13,700
I said this is not a good case, let's see it individually.

355
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:29,700
So I said OK come because I understood immediately this is going to be a difficult case.

356
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:48,830
Also if you have somebody saying weakness, it's very difficult to hit the remedy.

357
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:58,920
What is the blockage here? Is it and aggressiveness that has been disguised,

358
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:10,510
is it some traumatic experience in early stage of his life, is it the suppression of his father

359
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:22,850
and the authority of his father that has produced this kind? I can't say.

360
01:01:35,850 --> 01:01:39,110
What you were saying? Give us some help.

361
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:52,530
I was going to predict that you are not going to give any information.

362
01:01:54,020 --> 01:02:00,420
Tell us your own observations, you don't need to agree with him.

363
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:07,670
Tell me something that comes to your mind. What is the first thing

364
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:16,020
that comes to your mind about him?
-He is always thinking.

365
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:24,610
-Intellectual.
-Very restless.

366
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:31,690
-A restless intellectual, which is tired as well, Picric acid.

367
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:45,770
-Much anger inside and anxiety about health.

368
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,270
-Do you think you have anxiety about health?
-Yes.

369
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:57,960
-What do you think that you are going to develop cancer or something like that?

370
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:00,100
What do you think will break down first?

371
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:06,310
-What worries me is my weakness, nothing more. I don't think about heart or cancer

372
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:09,410
or anything like that. I did that before.

373
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:17,240
When I had always pain in my stomach, sometimes I thought that maybe it is cancer

374
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:27,830
but now I don't do that anymore. Now I worry about this weakness.

375
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:42,560
-The pressure in your abdomen comes when you drive a taxi or you drive a long time?

376
01:03:42,660 --> 01:04:00,510
-Not just walking... the traffic... people in the bus...

377
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:06,310
-When you see all this traffic or when you are in the traffic?

378
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:09,160
-When I'm in the traffic.

379
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:13,410
-And you are afraid that you may have an accident? You worry about that?

380
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:20,750
-Yes, I had several accidents.

381
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:35,990
-Why do you think you have accidents?
-I had an accident where I nearly killed myself.

382
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:47,830
-When you drive so fast...
-No, I enjoy it.

383
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:10,100
In the night when I was sleeping it was like I was still in the driving and I couldn't relax.

384
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:14,600
I had this tension all the time.

385
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,750
-Do you like eating fat?
-Yes.

386
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:25,570
-You enjoy?

387
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:31,330
-Much more than before. Before I had an aversion to it, now not.

388
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:36,260
Especially what we eat at Christmas, this pork.

389
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:47,850
I like butter very much, I like the sour cream.

390
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:12,250
-You said before when you are really angry, you may be bursting into weeping finally.

391
01:06:12,350 --> 01:06:13,930
-Yes.

392
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:24,500
-That's the only thing he said yes. You don't want to change that? It is a fact?

393
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:27,590
Can we rely upon that?

394
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:42,830
-When I get to that point, at first I'm very angry, I explode and then I have some kind of weeping.

395
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:48,330
-It was a period of time that you liked drinking wine, brandy?

396
01:06:52,180 --> 01:07:03,930
-Not so much. I like to drink very much but I get very tired from it, so I avoid it.

397
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:20,170
-The remedy at this moment is Nux vomica because there is actually an aggressiveness

398
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:25,670
behind all that which he is presenting, because of the sleeplessness,

399
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:40,500
because of the tendency to cry finally after a great fit of anger and irritability

400
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:46,260
and because he feels tired and wants stimulants.

401
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:52,660
Since one year he wants to drink coffee, he must stimulate himself

402
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:57,430
and because his energy goes down.

403
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,930
You see how nice he presented it and covered up?

404
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:12,330
-Coffee would harm him very much...

405
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:19,750
-Also the fact that he drinks coffee and brings up his system,

406
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:29,580
it means that coffee will definitely antidote his remedy. He has to take a Nux vomica,

407
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:37,600
just be absent for a week from his house during the aggravation period.

408
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:54,460
The only remedy that I feel most close at this moment is Nux vomica 1M or 10M even

409
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:02,820
and leave it to act. Stop drinking coffee.

410
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:10,960
If Nux vomica is drinking coffee, the remedy is finished.

411
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:21,150
They desire coffee, they drink and they get high and then they cannot sleep.

412
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:36,830
The symptom which we rely at the mostly is weeping after anger. See in your Repertories.

413
01:09:43,310 --> 01:09:52,460
Read the remedies. We have Arnica, Belladonna, Nux vomica and Platina

414
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,900
are the main remedies for that.

415
01:09:56,890 --> 01:10:02,540
There were other symptoms to imply but Nux vomica was better

416
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:10,300
where there was an aggression inside, and irritability that was held back,

417
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:15,640
there was a sleeplessness, as a main symptomatology.

418
01:10:16,350 --> 01:10:24,300
So irritability held back and sleeplessness gives Nux vomica, with a keynote weeping after anger,

419
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:30,800
when they go very nervous and then they break in crying.

420
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,570
This is characteristic of Nux vomica.

421
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:45,810
Then the fastidiousness, the fat and the stimulants.

422
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:57,130
He said since last year if I can drink 10 coffees, I will drink.

423
01:10:57,230 --> 01:11:01,150
I'm afraid that my health will go down but there is a desire for stimulants.

424
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:05,630
This is what we say in our Materia Medica desires stimulants.

425
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:09,130
Don't see the Materia Medica as something flat.

426
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:17,210
Imagine it in a person drinking, drinking coffee and whatever can stimulate his body.

427
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:22,800
He is from a health kind of line, therefore he does not allow himself to drink

428
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:25,550
so much coffee or to drink alcohol but he needs that.

429
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:37,460
You see a case who does not drink coffee and suddenly he need coffee, he needs stimulants.

430
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:41,720
This is a time where he has been into a state of Nux vomica.

431
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:51,210
Why? Because of that reason, that reason also. Not only because he needs stimulants.

432
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:57,390
If you say, I had been drinking coffee since I was a baby, instead of milk,

433
01:11:57,490 --> 01:12:02,380
my mother gave me coffee, I would not take it into consideration.

434
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:11,880
But if he says since last year I need a coffee, what I hear is since one year he needs stimulants.

435
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:14,730
Since one year he is Nux vomica.

436
01:12:16,730 --> 01:12:23,870
Nux vomica with a possibility of -later- as a complementary, of Sulphur.

437
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:34,120
Maybe after Nux vomica Sulphur will be indicated. Just have it in mind and if the symptoms arise...

438
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:42,260
If he will notice that the desire for sugar or for sweets will increase, he will notice

439
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:56,100
that his feet are warm and he must take them out of covers, perhaps that he is not

440
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:02,340
so fastidious anymore, he will notice that he would become lazy

441
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:07,190
and I don't want to study or to work...

442
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:16,090
These kind of things he will notice and the aggression will be less, maybe after a Nux vomica

443
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:22,230
he will have a quarrel one day.

444
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:34,480
OK, I think we went through.
