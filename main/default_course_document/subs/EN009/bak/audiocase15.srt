1
00:00:31,860 --> 00:01:09,980
-This is somebody whom I saw in October 1990 and I haven't given her any remedies for

2
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,430
at least one year but in the beginning I gave her Lycopodium 30C and then I gave her

3
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:37,560
Kali silica 6C, Phosphorus 200C one dose, Calcarea carbonica 30C

4
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,260
-That made me sick.

5
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:50,060
-That made her worse, Tuberculinum 30C. That was March 11th 1991, when she had the

6
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:57,390
Tuberculinum and that was her last remedy.

7
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,970
-Is there a diagnosis?

8
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:07,140
-She has many symptoms, maybe just wait to see the interview and then we can decide

9
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:27,210
the diagnosis.

10
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,630
-You are photogenic I see.

11
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,390
-Thank you.

12
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:36,460
-What is your problem?

13
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,220
-I have a lot of different symptoms. My main complaint is fatigue, I'm tired most of the time

14
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:54,960
and dizzy almost all of the time, poor concentration, loss of balance, feeling spaced

15
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:14,320
out, nausea, when I'm very tired I feel very nauseous. I think I have to look in my book.

16
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,400
-These are the main things that you remembered immediately.

17
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:30,650
-Yes, those are the main things. Feeling tired most of the time, I get energy I feel very

18
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:36,940
energetic and then all of a sudden my energy drops down.

19
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,320
I wake up feeling tired most of the time, sometimes I wake up feeling depressed.

20
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:49,900
I have mood swings where I feel great and then I get depressed and I can be that way for

21
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,400
a couple of hours and then I come up again and I feel OK.

22
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:04,070
Everything that I do every day I'm always judging whether I can handle it.

23
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:10,240
It's always like a fine balancing between what I can do and what I can't do.

24
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:15,070
Where I should hold back and take it easy and rest  and where I can push myself and see

25
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,270
how far I can go.

26
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,980
-Since when you are having these problems?

27
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,320
-Ten years.

28
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,320
-From age of 19 you are fatigue.

29
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,560
-Yes.

30
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,480
-Why? Do you know why?

31
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:44,480
-I have ideas. When I was 16 I started antibiotic treatments for three years.

32
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,990
-Three years?

33
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,090
-For three solid years.

34
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,370
-For what?

35
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:59,080
-For my face, acne. I didn't know anything about it then, now I know a lot about antibiotics.

36
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:05,450
And I react now when I take antibiotics, like flu symptoms, I get very sick for a couple of

37
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:12,370
weeks and stay in bed.

38
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:19,700
I was worse about five years ago. There were times when I couldn't get out of bed,

39
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,250
I would go to bed sometimes 8-9 o'clock in the evening and I would have so little energy,

40
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:30,120
I couldn't even talk to anybody, I was just lying in bed and watch TV.

41
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,000
From that time I got a little better, so I'm definitely better than I used to be.

42
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,670
There were times when I couldn't get out of bed.

43
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:45,660
-Who gave you this treatment? It was a doctor or yourself?

44
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:56,690
-I started with a chiropractor. He would do body work on me and he gave me Airborne

45
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:02,270
remedies and tinctures and things like that.

46
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,940
-But what about the antibiotics? Who gave you?

47
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,430
-That was the dermatologist.

48
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,800
-He, himself said for three years you have to take it?

49
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,390
-Yes, I was going back and say I need a refill and he just

50
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,190
-He wrote another prescription.

51
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:31,270
-He would do a drawing of my face every time I went to see him, how many pimples I still

52
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:37,050
have on my face.

53
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:53,720
-Now you have very nice skin but behind the skin things are not...so great

54
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:00,360
-What will happen if we give you a remedy and your acne comes back?

55
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,940
-That's OK. If I feel better and I have acne that's OK.

56
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,690
-That's OK. Are you sure?

57
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:09,120
-Yes, I'm sure.

58
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:17,010
-I understand how much you suffer from that.

59
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:31,210
Other symptoms that you have?

60
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,710
-Do you have anemia?

61
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,380
-She is ready to cry.

62
00:07:53,900 --> 00:08:02,120
-It's been difficult.

63
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:09,960
-What you thought now and brought you tears? What was in your mind?

64
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,330
-Thinking about the symptoms.

65
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:20,960
-You thought some symptoms that you wanted to relate and that brought you tears?

66
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:30,800
-I think just talking about it. I think most of the time that I'm OK, that I'm not sick.

67
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,540
-You try to persuade yourself, you say you are not sick?

68
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:42,710
-Yes, I think I'm OK and I get up and just keep pushing on. Every day I just keep going.

69
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:49,210
I have good days also and I have some days where I feel really good but those days are

70
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:55,880
far and few.

71
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,130
-Are you married?

72
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,160
-No.

73
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,420
-Do you have children?

74
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,240
-No.

75
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,130
-You live with your family or by yourself?

76
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,380
-With a roommate.

77
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,540
-How do you feel emotionally?

78
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,630
-I feel stronger than I used to. I used to feel depressed most of the time.

79
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:31,800
I used to cry a lot, I used to feel not very strong, I feel much stronger now.

80
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:40,880
I've worked out some of the emotional things.

81
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,960
In the beginning it was more difficult because I would see medical doctors and

82
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,750
they couldn't help and they would say there is nothing wrong with you.

83
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,210
You just need a psychiatrist. That was difficult.

84
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,990
When doctors kept telling me there is nothing wrong with you and they still say that.

85
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:06,710
From time to time I go back and tell them that I don't feel great.

86
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:13,160
They do blood tests and they say everything is normal, you are fine.

87
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,210
-Very good.

88
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:42,720
So far the case looks like Pulsatilla.

89
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:49,830
-I have more symptoms, a lot more.

90
00:10:49,930 --> 00:11:02,540
-We will talk about it, don't worry but we make an analysis until this time and we say

91
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:20,550
that she looks like Pulsatilla; she used to cry a lot and she has changing moods.

92
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:26,210
-Lot of headaches, very often.

93
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,630
-When are  the headaches?

94
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,010
-I wake up in the morning with a headache sometimes, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter.

95
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,910
-There is no special time when you usually have a headache?

96
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:48,040
-No.

97
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:55,460
It's more often towards the end of the day rather than waking up with a headache.

98
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,660
-The fatigue, the dizziness, the poor concentration and loss of balance, all these

99
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:12,380
symptoms that she related in the beginning fit to a remedy, which is called Gelsemium.

100
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:25,210
And then eventually we have the changing moods and the weeping which went into Pulsatilla.

101
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:35,880
Now headaches without real modalities. What else do we have?

102
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:44,720
-It's hard to describe but I think you know how horses have the blinders on the sides?

103
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:55,050
Sometimes I feel that I could do this because I have a hard time focusing,

104
00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:02,110
not so much the concentration but if I'm walking down the street, I feel that it is easier for me

105
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,630
to look and to focus more in a smaller space rather than in a big space.

106
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:20,710
It is almost as if it is too much for me to take in. I can't focus. It's almost like a visual thing.

107
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:30,380
I get spaced out in Malls, so I avoid Malls, shopping Malls.

108
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:39,470
I get very late headed when I'm in a room that's really huge, where the ceiling is really high.

109
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:46,710
And the lighting affects me sometimes too.

110
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:53,130
I don't like neon lights, I just become aware of the fact that I'm in neon lights and I don't

111
00:13:53,230 --> 00:14:06,630
know somehow it seems to do something to my focus.

112
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,490
-She has 16 pages of symptoms.

113
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,710
-No 25.

114
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:23,550
-25 pages of symptoms, can you imagine? Again the same problem.

115
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:32,130
The immune system that has been harassed by three years of antibiotic treatment and all

116
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:38,540
kinds of chemicals that you inserted in your body.

117
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,880
-I started taking Gaviscon which is an anti-acid.

118
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:51,380
I took that every single day for a couple of years because of heartburn.

119
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:03,550
That was the beginning. When I was 16, I started to have this problem but I was taking

120
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,880
antibiotics at the same time.

121
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,720
-You were taking already antibiotics and then your stomach started having heartburns and

122
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,380
then you took anti-acids.

123
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,490
-Yes.

124
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,550
-Do you still take anti-acids now?

125
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:22,880
-Very rarely. Every once in a while I do.

126
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:31,130
-Also in this case we see the different steps that the disturbance followed.

127
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:39,720
First it is on the skin, then it goes to the stomach, to the mucus membranes of the

128
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:54,210
stomach and now it is deeper causing generalized problems, a fatigue syndrome almost.

129
00:15:54,310 --> 00:16:07,630
It is not a fatigue syndrome, it is an indescribable

130
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:18,720
Thats why they cannot find through the laboratory tests and pin down the disturbance.

131
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:33,380
Can you give us what is bothering you? Give us more information.

132
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,460
-I have bowel problems.

133
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,160
-Constipation or diarrhea?

134
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:50,040
-More severe than that. Sometimes cramping, a lot of mucus in the stool.

135
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:56,210
I was in a hospital about two years ago, my stomach was really bloated out and I had a lot

136
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,720
of cramping.

137
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,990
And I had a fever, so I went into emergency and they kept me for a week.

138
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:10,710
They thought at first I had an appendicitis but after three days they ruled that out and

139
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:18,220
they did some endoscopy tests, they do a lot of tests, ultra sound, blood tests,  lots of different things.

140
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:30,000
They couldn't find anything except to say that they felt that I had irritable bowel syndrome.

141
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:39,130
So everyone my bowels act up and then I just rest a bit more and I'm careful

142
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:44,130
of what I eat, I don't eat any meat, I don't eat breads and things like that.

143
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:52,430
I just eat soups and cooked vegetables until it clears up, then I go back to my normal diet.

144
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:59,600
I had it last week for about five or six days and sometimes it gets to the point where I'm

145
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:10,870
lying in bed for a couple of hours and that seems to just make me feel a bit better.

146
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:25,100
-At this moment we can go to the Repertory and see if we use fatigue, dizziness, we look

147
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:37,280
through this poor concentration, nausea, unrefreshed sleep.

148
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:43,440
-You still have this bloatedness?

149
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,650
-Not all the time, sometimes.

150
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,610
-Mucus in stool frequently?

151
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,400
-No, when I start to feel the cramping.

152
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,490
-How frequently?

153
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:09,520
-It's very mild for a couple of days. It's mild when it's bothering and then I know that I have to be careful.

154
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,350
-How frequently?

155
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:19,570
-Once the month, sometimes twice the month.

156
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:24,850
-The headache how frequently?

157
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:31,770
-3-4 times the week.

158
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:39,100
-The headache, the most frequent time that comes is morning, evening?

159
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,350
-Middle day to evening.

160
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:49,480
-Specify the time, if you can.

161
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:59,080
-Early afternoon, two o'clock.
-Until?

162
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:09,590
-It depends. Sometimes it lasts for two days, sometimes I go to bed still with a headache.

163
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:20,530
-Because her symptoms are not peculiar and are not defined and are not with modalities,

164
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:28,920
we can only get an idea by looking what is most prominent in these general symptoms.

165
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,080
How many symptoms you put already in, 5-6?

166
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:47,160
Can you give me the symptoms? Let me see the symptoms.

167
00:20:47,260 --> 00:21:00,330
Suppressed eruptions, weakness, weeping in telling her symptoms, changeable mood,

168
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:09,870
mucus in stool, unrefreshing sleep and stomach nausea.

169
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:15,070
It's very difficult to make a decision with these symptoms and

170
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:30,970
if we go to the flat repertorization, it will show?

171
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:38,900
Flat repertorization gives Pulsatilla as a first possibility and Sepia as a second

172
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,150
and Kali carbonicum as a third.

173
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:54,430
So the Expert System most probably will give Pulsatilla as well.

174
00:21:54,530 --> 00:22:06,650
No. Psorinum, Petroleum, Sepia, Sulphur, Baryta carbonica, Staphysagria, Alumina,

175
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:12,750
Ammonium carbonicum.

176
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,180
Do you feel in general better in cold weather?

177
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,730
-No, worse.

178
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,650
-Very much worse? Cold really affects you?

179
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:34,240
-Yes, very cold weather does.

180
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,740
As you saw in the Expert System, it cannot make a decision.

181
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,380
So it gave underneath, interrogate about these remedies.

182
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:05,280
So the first thing in order to discriminate between the Pulsatilla that has most of the symptoms

183
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:24,500
and the Psorinum is the feeling of cold or warm. She is a chilly person aggravated by cold.

184
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:47,320
Can you give me what symptoms has the Psorinum?

185
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:56,770
The suppressed eruption, strong weakness, the changeable mood, mucus,

186
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:02,410
the unrefreshed sleep and the nausea.

187
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:13,820
-I should add also one more thing that I have sore throat a lot, chronic.

188
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:31,250
-So she had an aggravation after Calcarea carbonica, she became worse?

189
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:35,770
-Yes it made me quite sick.

190
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:41,080
-Without improving the situation?

191
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:51,450
-No. The only thing that helped was Phosphorus but it didn't help for very long.

192
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:04,480
-It doesn't matter. Would you give some of the symptoms that you have underlined

193
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,890
or do you want to continue with your symptoms or you finished?

194
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:15,140
-I have others but the ones that I gave you are the important ones.

195
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,980
-Do you have fears?

196
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,800
-Yes.

197
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,310
-What kind?

198
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:30,060
-Fear of running out of time.

199
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,550
-Which means you do not have enough time to do the work?

200
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,980
There is a feeling of hurried inside?

201
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,060
-Yes.

202
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:50,800
-Another?

203
00:25:54,530 --> 00:26:00,890
-Fear of losing control.

204
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,640
-Losing control of your mental faculties?

205
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:11,640
-Yes.

206
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:16,980
-That's a strong fear, very strong? It bothers you really or it's just in the background and

207
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,560
sometimes it comes as an idea?

208
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,880
-In the background, sometimes.

209
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:29,980
-Another one?

210
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:40,970
-I think not reaching my potential.

211
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:46,230
-You are afraid you will just drift through life without really doing something creative?

212
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,180
-Yes.

213
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,420
-What are you doing at this moment as a profession?

214
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:09,470
-I paint, I make jewelry also.

215
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,340
-Do you have a relationship? A boyfriend?

216
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,720
-Yes.

217
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,640
-How you are with him?

218
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,810
-Good.

219
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:30,830
-You have no problems with your sexual behavior with him?

220
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:34,750
-Sometimes.

221
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,720
-Can you describe?

222
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:45,420
-I guess a lack of drive from my part sometimes.

223
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,630
-But when you have drive, you have desire, then you can reach orgasm?

224
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,390
-Yes, no problem.

225
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:02,970
-You see this is the possibility of Sepia that was coming up as a second possibility,

226
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:08,500
which seemed to be for a moment a possibility.

227
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:17,560
It might be because Sepia has all that fatigue and difficult concentration and the nausea.

228
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:24,810
Can you show me Sepia how many of the symptoms covers?

229
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:39,500
Sepia is a second possibility and it covers suppressed eruption, weakness, weeping,

230
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:48,140
telling of her sickness, changeable mood, slimy mucus, unrefreshing sleep, nausea,

231
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,560
inflammation of tonsils.

232
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:20,520
Did you put worse cold? Did you enter it?

233
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:30,850
-I feel better in the summer, much better. In the dryness and the sun.

234
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:46,020
-Better warm. Baryta carbonica, Tuberculinum, Sepia, Carbo animalis, Petroleum,

235
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,270
Digitalis, Aconitum, Sulphuric acid and Alumina.

236
00:29:52,370 --> 00:30:02,100
Baryta carbonica, that gives us another idea and Sepia possibilities, with Carbo animalis,

237
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,470
with the sluggish circulation.

238
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:16,910
-Do you perspire at all?

239
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,520
-Yes.

240
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,240
-Is your perspiration offensive?

241
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,490
-No.

242
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,480
-You do not use this deodorant?

243
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:30,330
-Yes I do.

244
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,650
-That's why it is not. You don't know.

245
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:39,020
-I do most of the time, not all the time.

246
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,370
-Why you do it? Just in case?

247
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:50,810
-Just in case.

248
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,370
-When you are in bed your feet are cold?

249
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:04,050
-Yes.

250
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,790
-You have to wear socks?

251
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,000
-Not in the summertime.

252
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,830
-In winter?

253
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:18,540
-Yes. My nose and my hands are usually cold.

254
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,790
-In winter do you have to cover your head?

255
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:23,960
-A lot.

256
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,210
-Do you have to wear something warm?

257
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:33,790
-Yes I'm covered up to here, I wear lots of layers, 4,5,6 layers.

258
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:37,800
-My god.

259
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:43,050
-Sometimes two pairs of socks and boots that are lined.

260
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,960
-If your head is exposed to cold, will you get a headache?

261
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:54,630
-Yes. If my room is too cold, then I wake up with a headache.

262
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:58,040
-So do you have in sleep to wear something on your head as well?

263
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,160
-No.

264
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,170
-But you have to warm your room quite a lot?

265
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:10,970
-Yes.

266
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:26,060
You will see that Psorinum, I was not thinking at all about Psorinum but I got the hint from

267
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:41,890
the repertorization and the hint seems to be maybe a good one to start with this case.

268
00:32:53,420 --> 00:33:02,210
-Tell me did you have a lot of boyfriends? You were hurt during these relationships?

269
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,220
-Sure.

270
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,720
-A lot?

271
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,470
-Sometimes, not always.

272
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:19,800
-Tell me when it was the time when your skin finally became clean, as it is now?

273
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:24,750
At what age? 19 or 20?

274
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:31,060
-It got better in early twenties but it still breaks out.

275
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,080
-But a little?

276
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,800
-Less.

277
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:44,550
-But it got much better already by the age of 19?

278
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:51,800
-No, when I stopped the antibiotics it got really bad.

279
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,880
-Then what you did? You took some more?

280
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,720
-No, at 19 I stopped.

281
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:04,470
-Then how the acne disappeared?

282
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:13,500
-Just slowly over the years.

283
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,050
-When did you start having sexual relationship?

284
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,800
-16.

285
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:19,550
-16 already?

286
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:27,710
-Yes, don't tell my mother.

287
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:36,800
-We don't tell anybody. Actually everybody here who is in the class is under oath that will

288
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:46,970
not discuss anything outside of the class. Otherwise it would be very difficult.

289
00:34:47,070 --> 00:35:01,000
Here we can discuss everything but outside of the class there is a code of secrecy.

290
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,640
Sexually you were awaken strongly?

291
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:09,470
-No.

292
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:17,220
-The acne broke out at the age of 15 or 16?

293
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:26,550
-No, it started at 13.

294
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,800
-You started having sexual intercourse at the age of 16 regularly?

295
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,750
-No.

296
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,800
-It was accidental?

297
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,810
-Yes a couple of times.

298
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:48,050
-When did you start having normal sexual intercourse, at what age?

299
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,390
-I would say about 20, 21.

300
00:35:52,490 --> 00:36:01,470
-Do you think that there is a kind of relation between having sexual normal intercourse

301
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,560
and the diminishing of the acne?

302
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:09,000
-No.

303
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,600
-Are you the only person in the family? Do you have a sister?

304
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,760
-I have two sisters and two brothers.

305
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,720
-Did they have the same problem with the acne?

306
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:27,520
-My sister does but it came out much later, in her twenties.

307
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:37,510
-Do you have strong finger nails or they are weak? They break easily?

308
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:44,050
-When they are long, they break after a couple of weeks, they split.

309
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:50,440
They are a bit stronger than they used to be. They used to be very weak.

310
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:57,770
-Usually they split or they crack?

311
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:05,390
-They split and crack, both.

312
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,120
-This one is strong.

313
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:24,870
-Only one finger is strong. So you keep it longer a bit. I see it's the only finger nail that is a bit longer.

314
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,200
We have that symptom? No.

315
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,120
-Only one never breaks.

316
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:40,760
Here we have brittle finger nails, we have Graphites and Psorinum which are capitals.

317
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:52,180
-They are always drying around the nails, always.

318
00:37:52,280 --> 00:38:00,030
Dryness of fingers around nails, do we have? No.

319
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,120
-Are you jealous?

320
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,370
-No although I can be.

321
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:19,200
-Can you wear something which is tight here?

322
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:27,200
-Never. I never wear anything really tight.

323
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,040
-Why?

324
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,620
-I just like my neck open.

325
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,620
-Why? Because you have a nice neck and you want to show it?

326
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:46,530
-No because I just feel uncomfortable when there is something around my neck.

327
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,820
-Around your waist you can put a belt?

328
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:54,380
-Yes.

329
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,870
-Around your breast you can wear a bras?

330
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:01,780
-Yes.

331
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,370
-You can wear, you don't feel restricted by that?

332
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,280
-No, just around my neck.

333
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:17,070
Can you show me that symptom?

334
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:34,960
Silica is another possibility for her. She is cold, she looks mild. We don't know whether she is mild.

335
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:39,890
We have to ask her boyfriend to tell us how mild she is.

336
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:48,330
-He won't say this.

337
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:20,720
Clothing aggravates. Crotalus horridus, Sancris, Lachesis, Crotalus cascavella.

338
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:41,710
Put that also, put it three times, she is definite about that. You don't want...

339
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,090
-I hate it.

340
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:54,120
Let me see the analysis.

341
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:08,290
Still Psorinum and you see the Lachesis it was a thought.

342
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:14,290
It has come up with Sepia and Silica. Silica also is there.

343
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,620
Now we have different possibilities to think about. Give me the columns.

344
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:32,280
Here you see the Psorinum, Sepia, Lachesis, Silica, Kali carbonicum, Tuberculinum, Arsenicum,

345
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,040
Carbo animalis, Nitric acid, Kali bichromicum etc.

346
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:42,650
The most interesting possibilities for her are Psorinum and then Silica

347
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:56,240
and then I would say Lachesis. There is a possibility for Lachesis but as a second prescription perhaps.

348
00:41:56,340 --> 00:42:02,900
When the body is more warm. There are any flashes of heat?

349
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,150
-Sometimes yes.

350
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:13,520
-You were never jealous?

351
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:24,900
-I can be but I don't consider myself a jealous person in general but I can be of course.

352
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,400
-Yes of course, sure.

353
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:38,070
-Is there severe anemia her whole life?

354
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:43,150
-Can you give us some more information from what you have underlined?

355
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:47,220
-Not severe so much anymore.

356
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,560
-Since 17 years old she had anemia.

357
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:59,520
-You often wake up with cramps in your abdomen?

358
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,350
-In the mornings, almost every morning.

359
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:09,560
-Waking up with cramps every morning, can you give me cramps in abdomen?

360
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:17,640
Just show me that symptom. Cramps in the abdomen on waking in the morning,

361
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:22,480
morning in bed on waking.

362
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:30,890
Agaricus, Cobaltum, Colchicum, Lycopodium, Manganum, Menyanthes, Nat. muriaticum,

363
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,470
Rheum and Xanthoxylum.

364
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:00,220
-Lots of back pain.

365
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:06,980
-With the bowel problems comes the back ache.

366
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:13,720
-Higher in the back or low back?

367
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:25,720
-Low. When my bowels are acting, cramping and bloating and all that, then I get back ache with it.

368
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,230
-Her memory is very bad.

369
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,230
-The short term.

370
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:32,890
-You remember past things?

371
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:34,890
-Yes.

372
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:40,310
-What you will forget? You want to get something from the other room and you will forget?

373
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,480
-Yes sometimes.

374
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,400
-Or you want to say something and you forget or you forget the name of your friends?

375
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,480
-Yes.

376
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:51,900
-All that?

377
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,920
-Yes. It's up and down.

378
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:13,180
-Her muscles can burn with fatigue when she climbs upstairs, her muscles are burning

379
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:23,390
and she can't sustain regular exercise. She feels better if she eats every few hours.

380
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:25,180
-Better eating?

381
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,150
-Better eating every few hours but not too much.

382
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:37,590
-But you may feel bad in general and then you eat and you feel better or especially the

383
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:41,470
stomach feels better after eating?

384
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:51,890
-After I eat I feel better, if I haven't eaten too much but sometimes I feel nauseous after I eat.

385
00:45:51,990 --> 00:46:02,980
-Again we have a symptom of Sepia here. This is a strong symptom for Sepia.

386
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:20,480
-She is describing herself as having an open nature and sympathetic.

387
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:31,580
-I feel that I'm shy but I'm bold also. It depends. I can be very shy and I can be very bold.

388
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,370
-Are you sympathetic?

389
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:38,450
-Yes definitely.

390
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,160
-What example would you give for sympathetic?

391
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:44,540
-I feel open and warm towards people and I feel sympathetic to people.

392
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:46,800
-But do you feel it to a pathological degree?

393
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:52,240
-No.

394
00:46:52,340 --> 00:47:05,740
-She likes salt and sweets. One after the other, she said.

395
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:12,360
-But would you take and put extra salt in your food before tasting it?

396
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:16,380
-Sometimes, I try not to.

397
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,070
-Do you have to have sweets every day?

398
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:28,570
-Almost. If I don't,
it's a conscious decision not to.

399
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:40,790
-Thirsty all the time for warm and cold drinks. She is quite thirsty.

400
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:43,710
-How much you drink in total?

401
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:46,040
-A day?

402
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:50,950
-Yes.

403
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:56,540
-Eight glasses the day or more.

404
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:03,540
-A little by little or you drink half a glass?

405
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:10,990
-A little by little, usually it's slowly but sometimes I drink the whole glass in one shot.

406
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:15,860
-What else do you have underlined?

407
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:22,860
-Fear of closed in spaces.

408
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,490
-Like the elevator?

409
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:30,740
-No.

410
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,160
-Can you give us an example?

411
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:42,830
-A really long narrow room, if I have to stay in a long, narrow room.

412
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:47,860
-Not that you go to the cinema for instance and you feel claustrophobic?

413
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,740
-Not anymore. I used to have panic attacks for one year.

414
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:58,030
-Which year?

415
00:49:03,470 --> 00:49:06,740
-At 20 to 21.

416
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,170
-She had a fear of death at that time.

417
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:12,580
-Yes very strong fear of death.

418
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,580
-Not now?

419
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,160
-No.

420
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:18,310
-It's gone totally?

421
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:19,560
-No.

422
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:22,620
-Would you say it's better if I die? No.

423
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,980
Do you say to yourself what a life and I'm struggling and it's better if I die?

424
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,880
-Sometimes but not most of the time.

425
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:38,360
-Neither you contemplate ever suicide?

426
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:48,170
-Maybe for a fleeting moment I have the thought but there is always enough hope in me to continue.

427
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:52,170
-Fear of spiders.

428
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:58,500
-Not so strong.

429
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:12,120
-Stomach bloating of Ovarian cysts on the right side.

430
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:17,170
-Show me the right side. How did they find?

431
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:21,840
-Ultra sound.

432
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:24,450
-Because you had pains or accidentally?

433
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:30,840
-Accidentally, just a routine examination but now sometimes it bothers me.

434
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,620
-How big is that cyst, did they tell you?

435
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:41,260
-It's in my file but I don't know.

436
00:50:44,290 --> 00:51:00,940
-Cysts on right side. Apis, Floric acid, Iodine.

437
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:13,350
What is the capital? Lycopodium. Palladium, Podophyllum, Rhododendron.

438
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:19,970
-There was one here that we wrote down before, that when I'm really tired, when I'm

439
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:38,490
reading something the words just fly off. They fly off my page and I lose my balance for a second.

440
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:54,150
-Anything else?

441
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:13,960
Words jump when reading, give me that. Only Senega?

442
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:39,050
Words jump when reading, Senega, Belladonna and Lyssinum.

443
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:51,410
-I feel guilty about being sick.

444
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:59,720
-Why do you think you feel guilty? You feel you have done something that you are

445
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:12,720
responsible for what you have done? Because you took antibiotics or it just comes out?

446
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:39,900
-Sometimes.

447
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:44,190
-She wants to give up sometimes.

448
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:54,440
-But when we talked about fear of going crazy, the fear that all finally will break down.

449
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:17,800
-You are free now to torment her by your questions?

450
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,050
-OK I grind my teeth.

451
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:24,080
-When? During sleep?

452
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,960
-Yes.

453
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:45,880
-Give me that symptom so they can see in the Repertory, grinding teeth during sleep.

454
00:54:51,850 --> 00:55:04,210
Arsenicum, Tuberculinum of course. Enter it to the repertorization twice.

455
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:27,050
-I think it was December '90, I was told that I had herpes but I've never had problems since then with it.

456
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:33,910
So I don't know if I actually have problems or not.

457
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:44,330
-Tell me something, your foot nails, your big toe they are in growing? You have a problem like that?

458
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:51,780
-A little bit. Not serious problem.

459
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:58,940
-First of all can you tell us a bit more about your headache? When you get a headache

460
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:07,310
what it is like? You have any symptoms that come with headaches?

461
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:16,900
-If I don't take Tylenol for the headache, it just gets progressively worse, so that eventually

462
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,640
I get very nauseous with the headache.

463
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:23,430
-Where does it hurt? Usually it's the one part of your head?

464
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:26,650
-On top. I have a headache now, it's very slight and it's on top.

465
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:29,900
-It's that where usually is?

466
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,900
-Yes on top and sometimes in the back of my neck.

467
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:39,020
-How about your cramping with fruits and sugary things, does this disturb your abdomen and give you gas?

468
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:51,070
-It tends to be heavy things like a bagel. I can eat one bagel, they are very dense,

469
00:56:51,170 --> 00:57:00,940
I can eat meat a couple of times the week. I make sure that every day I eat fruits and vegetables,

470
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,720
like with the more concentrated foods I make sure that it's balanced.

471
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:06,560
-How do you do with onions? Do you like onions?

472
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:10,800
-Yes I love onions.

473
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:15,650
-One last question. When you have problems with cramping do you ever get a sensation

474
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:20,800
as if there is a heavy pressure on your abdomen?

475
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:33,560
-Yes if I press my stomach, it feels very hard and it feels as if my intestines are like filled

476
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:38,390
and it's very compact and hard to touch.

477
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:45,220
-Do you ever get the feeling as if the uterus is pushed down through the vagina,

478
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:48,750
that kind of sensation?

479
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:53,140
-Not really.

480
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:06,960
-I want to ask you something. I was wondering during this whole interview you had your legs crossed.

481
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,050
If you uncross them what kind of sensation do you experience?

482
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:17,780
I don't mean now, generally? The whole interview you haven't move your legs,

483
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,110
what will happen, why you always have them crossed?

484
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:24,160
-Nothing will happen except from nervous.

485
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:28,170
-So there is no sensation or anything else?

486
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:34,670
-It was time to uncross them.

487
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:53,530
-Do you have any white spots on your finger nails?

488
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,910
-Yes I do.

489
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,500
-Let me see.

490
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,530
-Not right now.

491
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:10,750
-How are you with shots? Getting injections?

492
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:18,910
-If they take a lot of blood sometimes I feel not too great after, I lie down for 10 minutes.

493
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:21,830
-Any history of recreational drugs?

494
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:26,030
-Not really.

495
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:29,550
-Tobacco.

496
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:33,380
-How about foot sweats? Does your feet sweat?

497
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:34,960
-Yes.

498
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:36,470
-Smelly?

499
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:39,220
-Only if I wear nylons.

500
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,170
-How about sharp objects?

501
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:42,410
-What about them?

502
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:47,380
-He mentioned injections, how do you feel about pointed, sharp objects?

503
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:52,800
-I use them every day.

504
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,720
-Can you tell us about your menstruation please?

505
00:59:55,820 --> 01:00:00,140
-They are terrible. I suffer a lot.

506
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,580
-Could you tell us what is most important for you? Personal relationships, job, ambition,

507
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,470
what is that you really want in life?

508
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:17,210
-Work is very important. I think it's number one. What I do with my life, my path.

509
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:19,880
-What do you do?

510
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:30,300
-I make jewelry and I paint.

511
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:38,800
I feel very tired to the three days before my cycle starts.

512
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:41,720
-And you have pains?

513
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:47,050
-Yes, the first day I wish I didn't have to work, I wish I could just stay home.

514
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:50,220
-Is it since the beginning of your menstruation,

515
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,040
since the very first time that you're having this?

516
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:58,130
-Yes, it's always being like that.

517
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:02,380
-How do you express affection for your loved ones?

518
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:11,550
-Doing things for them, baking something that they like, running if they need to do

519
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:14,500
something and they don't have time, telling them

520
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,040
-What about hugs?

521
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:20,640
-Sure, hugs and kisses.

522
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:32,170
-You said you like sunny weather. Can you afford to take sun baths?

523
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:35,300
-I love sun and I feel better in the sun.

524
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,130
-It means you may stay one hour, taking a sunbath and feeling well?

525
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:41,710
-Yes.

526
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:47,800
-Now about your menstruation are they in time, very regular or late?

527
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:52,170
-They are a little bit off but they are very short.

528
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:56,460
-Off you mean sometimes late?

529
01:01:56,560 --> 03:01:30,970
-My cycle is18 to 24-25 days.
-Thank you.
