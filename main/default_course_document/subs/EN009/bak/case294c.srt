1
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:31,360
-This is my second follow up. Last time you had prescribed Ignatia in C12, taken once every day

2
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:38,710
and every 3 weeks potentized higher. I now reached Ignatia C19.

3
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:43,610
I would like first to tell you something about the time between May and now.

4
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,190
About 8 days after starting Ignatia C12, while I was driving in my car to my clinic

5
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:58,540
I had a sudden, very intense, almost unbearable pain behind my sternum, in my chest.

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,690
The pain almost took my breath and actually I wanted to stop the car but I continued

7
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,610
after all because it slowly got better.

8
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,850
-The pain was behind the sternum?

9
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:19,850
-Yes. This was the only time that this pain occurred in such an acute intensity.

10
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,560
-It was there before? He had experience this pain?

11
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:31,510
-I've always had this pain but never so strong. I stopped Ignatia C12 for 3 days then

12
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,700
and since no further attack happened, I continued after that.

13
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:43,100
In the beginning of June, I then developed growing pains in my left hip and within one

14
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,300
week they grew so bad that I was only able to walk for a distance for about 500 m. That was all.

15
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:01,040
-Where exactly were the pains?
-In my left hip and my left thigh.

16
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,930
I continued taking Ignatia in spite of that and since it was my opinion of my idea

17
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:18,970
that mainly it had to do with muscle pains, I additionally took vitamin B6.

18
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,120
-Did he had this pain before?

19
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:32,280
-I did have those before but usually they only turned up after walking a distance of maybe 10-15 km.

20
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,680
The second idea I had concerning these pains was that maybe

21
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,180
they had to do with not having nicotine for a long time.

22
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,140
I stopped smoking completely at the end of March and since then I haven't touched...

23
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,470
And I thought that maybe it has to do with the drawal of nicotine.

24
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:06,420
This pain continued in this intensity for 2-3 weeks, I also had a pain during the night

25
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,920
and I always had this feeling as if I would have to throw my legs away.

26
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,670
And I also had this feeling in the night. And I always was very restless.

27
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,520
My wife told me that at night I'm tossing and turning very much.

28
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:34,160
-What he means, as if I have to throw to do this, to jerk or to stretch?

29
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:46,630
He had to do it, so it was restlessness of legs.

30
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,780
-No it was not the restlessness, it was the pain. The pain made me to do this movement

31
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,630
and that ameliorated it a bit.

32
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,890
-Stretched, jerking, made the pain feel better.

33
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:15,370
After the pain was over, then this tendency to throw his feet was gone?

34
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,550
-Yes.

35
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:27,190
In July was a time where energetically I did not feel so well. It was summer, it was very

36
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:33,430
hot in Germany and there came a time where, as well on my mental sphere, as also

37
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:39,680
physically, I felt a great tiredness, a great fatigue.

38
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:47,520
During this time I had the feeling that this pain behind my sternum wanted to move upwards

39
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:54,340
and get out. It didn't, it's still there, I can still feel it but I always still have the

40
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,940
sensation as if actually would like to rise up and come out.

41
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
-The pain?
- Yes.

42
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,030
-It's a similar pain with the one that was very severe, just less severe?

43
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,700
-This very intense pain was more a cutting pain, was a bit lower and was extending to

44
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:23,080
the abdomen, whereas this chronic pain is always here in this area and feels like a feast

45
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,060
which is inside there.

46
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,150
Now I would like to says something about my emotional development in these 3 1/2  months.

47
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:38,400
Overall I would like to say that I have the impression that I'm slowly getting rid of this

48
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:55,980
wall of armor, of being engaged in this armor.

49
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:06,720
I'm now able to express my emotional thoughts. I can not only put them into words but

50
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:12,210
they really almost press outwards, especially in discussions with my wife.

51
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,890
-With emotions?

52
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:26,300
-One I can put them into words and secondly I am able to express them.

53
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,880
I can bring them out, I can talk about them. The main symptoms I had mentioned was

54
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:38,980
vulnerability and this vulnerability has become much less.

55
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,380
Another thing that happened is, I used to have a very conflict loaded relationship with

56
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:58,630
the two children of my second wife before and within the last two months this has been

57
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,620
really resolved. Even though we have different opinions, we can talk openly with each

58
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,470
other and that has become much more at ease.

59
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:13,190
And what especially I have noticed and also my surroundings it that, maybe for the first

60
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:20,930
time in my life, I'm radiating a short of optimism and I also can notice this in my clinic that now

61
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,950
I'm able to lead and guide and accompany my patients on a way that can lead to real cure.

62
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:35,090
The other symptoms I had come to you for, were on the one hand side this empty

63
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:41,940
feeling in the stomach, the inner weakness and this feeling of an inner enemy.

64
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,480
And so I would like to add on some things about my symptoms and also about my mental sphere.

65
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:56,810
Maybe it's best if I start with a night. Once I asked my wife whether she had ever noticed

66
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:02,320
anything about my feet at night when she has to get up, whether they are covered or not

67
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,160
and she told me that the feet most of the times are uncovered.

68
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:14,810
What does that cause me some discomfort is that at nights I have certain attacks of

69
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:21,310
perspiration and I help myself by taking the covers of my bed and turning them around.

70
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:27,890
So the cooler outside then covers my body. I'm very warm at bed and actually you could

71
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,990
call me the constant heating of my wife.

72
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,910
-The heat who generates is rather recent?

73
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:50,700
-Actually I always had that but it got even more now. I wake regularly between 4,30 and 5

74
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,700
o'clock in the morning and then when I wake up always something very strange happens.

75
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:05,740
I have the sensation or this feeling as if they were two energies within me who are quarreling.

76
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:16,890
And in a way it's like my positive thoughts are always immediately being swallowed by a

77
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:20,740
kind of lazy dog like lying around there, too.

78
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,410
And he, then, immediately spits out negative thoughts.

79
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,560
I thought a lot of what it could be inside me, what I call my inner enemy, what it is ?

80
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,640
Because that has been really something that accompanies me all my life and has really

81
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,140
been using so much of my positive energies.

82
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,740
I think now I can feel it better or maybe I can express it in a better way.

83
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:53,640
I would express it the following way: It's a conflict, a quarrel between my positive inner

84
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:00,140
energy, which would be represented by the fire, and the negative energies, which are

85
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,820
a kind of sluggishness, meaning water.

86
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:12,070
This is a situation which lasts for about 45 minutes in the morning.

87
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,470
Then I get up, out of bed, I'm mostly quite warm then and I have to wash with cold

88
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,960
water immediately.

89
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:26,710
But after washing, if I don't immediately dry my skin with the towel, if I remain wet,

90
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:34,220
I develop such an unbearable itching of my skin that I find myself jumping and dancing

91
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,570
around the room because every scratching would only even more aggravated.

92
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,720
And the second thing that happens and this has also accompanied me most of my life

93
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,640
is that I get up with the urge for stool.

94
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:53,890
This occurs around 5,30-6 o'clock and that's actually the first thing I do, after I get out of

95
00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:01,390
bed, I go to the toilet and the stool passing goes quick, it's thoroughly and it's taken care

96
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,400
within 2 minutes, it's finished.

97
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,760
-No diarrhea?

98
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:13,660
-No, it's a soft stool. Afterwards, since I'm still full of this inner feeling of the quarreling of

99
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:22,850
the two energies within me, I brew myself a hot thin tea, I drink that and this ameliorates

100
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,440
my inner feeling.

101
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:38,430
And my impression is that the almost extincted inner fire of the positive energies,

102
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:45,940
which were extinguished from the watery side, for me it is like this hot tea rejuvenates my

103
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,710
inner fire again and brings back the positive.

104
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,850
What I've always had is an increasing of this empty feeling in the stomach between

105
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,200
10,30-11,30 in the morning.

106
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,700
And I used to knock this empty feeling down with cigarettes and now I always eat fruit.

107
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,590
What actually has remained unchanged is that always in the evenings around 8 or 9 p.m.

108
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:27,590
I start feeling very tired and I would like to work but mental work is causing a great

109
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,950
exertion for me at those times.

110
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,410
Then I wanted to add something that I noticed about my physical symptoms, while I'm

111
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:41,050
here on the island. In May I enjoyed being in the water, I liked to swim, the water was

112
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,220
cold then and I swimmed almost every day.

113
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,070
Now this time the water is warm and I realize that I hardly swim at all, I hardly go into the water.

114
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:58,060
Now I would just like to say a few short sentences about my personality.

115
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:07,220
Basically I'm a very simple person who can't really do much with the refined way of

116
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,460
higher society. Just to give an example.

117
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,710
I had two car accidents once, they were only minor accidents, the only 2 I had within

118
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,680
45 years of driving and for me the situations always were quite clear.

119
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:30,880
I saw, I knew that it was my fault and I always admitted it. I admitted my guilt immediately

120
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,130
and always engaged in regulations, right away and I never went to get a lawyer or

121
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:39,370
any of these kind of things they do in our days.

122
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:45,720
Meaning first don't admit anything and start engaging in some legal activity.

123
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,120
And I'm a person who likes to live along with the rhythm of nature.

124
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,620
For example I live in a house which is solely heated with wood stoves and I get up

125
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,370
every morning to heat all the stoves and get things going and I also prefer to only eat

126
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,700
that kind of food that is seasonal, what's growing at that certain time.

127
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,550
It's not compulsive in any way, it's just what I feel is the right thing.

128
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,130
Then I have a very special relationship with money.

129
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,130
There is nothing worse for me than if I have to write my bills.

130
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:25,890
With every patient I wonder whether the amount on the bill really resembles the

131
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,730
quality of my treatment.

132
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,890
-When he has to write a bill for the patient, not to pay.

133
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:39,640
-Yes, when I write the bills to my patients. And I only remembered now that a long time

134
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,980
ago, people characterized me as a typical absent-minded professor.

135
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:53,650
I have a deep desire for knowledge and I actually want to know everything down to the

136
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,980
very bottom, to the center.

137
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,230
And I also like to do handicrafts and my favorite material to work with is wood.

138
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:09,980
Just a small side step into the elements of the Chinese acupuncture.

139
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:20,550
My greatest problem is dealing with people is not so much timidity, it's more embarrassment.

140
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:27,300
And this embarrassment actually is the thing which always paralyses me.

141
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,940
And I would like to say something concerning my fears.

142
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,940
I have fear for others, as well as for the members of my family, as also for my patients.

143
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,700
And this fear develops in the case of my wife, for example, if she doesn't come home

144
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:51,290
at the time that she actually would. And then this terrible negative inner energy starts

145
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:58,230
posing images where I see terrible accidents and I expect the police to appear at the

146
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:04,250
house and all kinds of things like that and of course I can't go to sleep then.

147
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,070
And the same with my patients.

148
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:13,570
Even though I have good inner energy, I always develop these images of complications

149
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:19,740
and since I've gained a lot of experience in Medicine, especially with complications

150
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,490
these are the images that come and haunt me, especially in complicated cases.

151
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:30,730
For an example, in an acute case if I gave a remedy and I ask a patient to call me

152
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:37,480
again that night at 10 p.m. and he doesn't call, you can be sure that at 10.05 I'm going

153
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,090
to be calling him.

154
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:47,990
-I want to ask a question. He had an aggravation while standing.

155
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:53,560
There was an aggravation reported back in the original. Is it still there?

156
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:59,390
-I still have this symptom. I still have this symptom but due to the fact that I feel I have

157
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:06,640
straighten up myself and also through being straight physically, the pain is not so

158
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:13,380
severe anymore, I don't feel it that strong but up to today for more than 10-20 minutes

159
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,650
still is impossible for me.

160
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:27,800
-Something else I wanted to ask is how is his desire for sweets, he did not report

161
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,550
any desire for sweets but this has changed? Now he's eating more sweets?

162
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:39,040
-I do have quite some desire for sweets, especially in the evenings but I try to suppress it.

163
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:49,100
-He had reported vertigo from high places. Did he find himself in a situation where he could test that?

164
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,200
-Yes, I still have it. I was on a roof for a couple of times and I still have it.

165
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,380
-Is anything else he wants to report?

166
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,950
-I would like to say something general about the generation of my parents.

167
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:09,600
I have a very great anger on the generation of my parents because they were not

168
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:17,190
able to deal with the fact of this great injustice, attacking innocent people.

169
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,350
I especially noticed that when these issues came up now with the gold that the Nazists

170
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:32,100
took from the Jews and put it to Switzerland and other places and also with this kind

171
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,460
of slave workers they had in Germany, large companies during the war.

172
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:45,100
That they were not capable of admitting this great injustice and it is now the sons and

173
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,440
daughters who try to equalize out this great guilt.

174
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,120
When I now meet somebody of this generation, I go up and say into his face, that's

175
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,100
something I could have never imagine doing before but I think it's really necessary

176
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:12,100
to go and to speak into his face because I think we can only maybe liberate

177
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:20,350
ourselves and our children, if also these people finally develop a quality, where they

178
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:28,750
can admit the things they have done and not just put the blame in some imaginary State,

179
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,750
meaning political system.

180
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,910
-But I think that they have, at least the official German government has admitted that

181
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:51,490
and has paid already - as far as I know - quite a lot of money to Jewish people and to Israel.

182
00:19:51,590 --> 00:20:00,710
They still pay, I think, billions. But maybe on individual cases you still find some people

183
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,060
who feel they did the right things.

184
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,740
-Of course the political side gave this admittance and they needed it also for political

185
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:17,590
tactic but I just know they are so many people who still can not accept innerly the fact

186
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:24,930
that they have become guilty morally.
And they still don't want to admit what happened.

187
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:38,930
-These are difficult things to admit.
OK, thank you.

188
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:12,050
-This, as you everybody maybe is able to see, this is beautiful confirmation of the Theory.

189
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:23,110
When we say, you have to give the first remedy, then the next remedy will appear and

190
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:28,470
will become quite clear and then you can give it.

191
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:38,200
But how all the case opens up and develops, this is very interesting to perceive because

192
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:45,950
certain things, if you remember, from the previous repertorisation we did, maybe we can

193
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,380
put it back and you will see it.

194
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:59,670
We saw already, from the previous time, that this remedy was coming up and we still insisted.

195
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:06,320
Just push a little bit more. And you see you push the organism towards the right direction

196
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:19,760
and the remedy becomes clearer and clearer, until it comes now and you have a full clear case of?

197
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,330
-Sulphur

198
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:45,670
-Very good, that is the idea. And in spite of the fact, if you observe he still has the sighing.

199
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:55,810
From the previous time already we said, Sulphur most probably is going to be the next remedy but

200
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:05,660
still I did not prescribe it at the moment, because I still felt it was not clear enough. You see now?

201
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:27,060
You see Sulphur was coming already from the previous. That is when you have Sulphur

202
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:36,060
symptoms intermingled with Ignatia symptoms and I say yes, you prescribe on the upper

203
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,560
remedy and then the next one will push up.

204
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:46,910
Now show me the repertorisation you did now this time.

205
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:15,260
Some beautiful little changes which they push.

206
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:23,760
The time of emptiness 10,30-11,30. It is unbelievable.

207
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:33,610
This actually was a very good lecture on Sulphur which no teacher can do better.

208
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,540
Put the symptoms.

209
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:22,510
That means pain in extremities... you put all the symptoms.

210
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:32,760
This Expert System does absolutely.

211
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:45,660
Waking, stool on waking, everything now comes to Sulphur.

212
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,290
So what is the potency we shall give in this case?

213
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:59,820
CM, let me see CM? Nobody.

214
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:08,330
50M? 21.

215
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:15,430
10M? 35.

216
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:22,160
1M? 19.

217
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:28,410
200? 9.

218
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,900
30? 1.

219
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,840
12? Nobody.

220
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:21,650
In this case you are going to give a deeper remedy, quite deep, you are going to have

221
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:34,750
therefore some aggravation and it's going to make an X-ray of every system,

222
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:42,310
every organ, are you all right? Everything OK? Boom...

223
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:57,210
Because now it's deeper and of course you don't have reasons to doubt the organs

224
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:12,760
the organs are quite in a good condition, still you have to be careful. So the most wise remedy is 200.

225
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:27,000
To prescribe 200 is good enough to make an initial test, how this organism is reacting.

226
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:38,100
Also this time you don't repeat. You just give 1 time. Because it's clear, it's going to act.

227
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:45,010
If it does not act at all, that means the remedy is spoiled. Get another pharmacy.

228
00:28:54,260 --> 00:29:03,920
Something else that I would like to point out from the experience you had so far with remedies.

229
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:20,420
You see that the remedies that you need to cure are enough. I'm concerning with new

230
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:28,650
provings, new provings and all these remedies that were given is new provings, new

231
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,500
remedies are not really necessary.

232
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:41,560
The remedies that we know already, most of these cases are covered.

233
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:50,250
Perhaps 2 cases we had that goes away from the main remedies.

234
00:29:52,250 --> 00:30:00,250
Perhaps Acetanilidum, OK you say this is a seldom remedy.

235
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:14,650
But most of your cases should be treated and should be successful with what you know

236
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,790
originally.

237
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:22,830
Why this need for more remedies? Study the basic thing of the basic remedies.

238
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,080
And you will be a fantastic prescriber.

239
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:35,150
To go and read and more and more and something new, which is unreliable on top of it,

240
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:50,240
is wasting of time, wasting of energy and also misinformation which his blocking your eye sight.

241
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:59,640
Because if you put a lot how can you find out the few things that you want to rely upon.

242
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:09,240
Unless you base your knowledge on basics. What we try to do actually here.

243
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,760
Just learn the basic knowledge!

244
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:38,390
-George, I think most of us are waiting in vain for a lesson on potencies because you

245
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:44,250
have told us 50M or 10M if it is very clear. Now it's the opposite.

246
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:56,990
-But if you remember I said, when there is a child whom you have. He is not a child.

247
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:13,930
So if you give a very high potency, give a very big reaction. So you have to judge.

248
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:30,710
If he was 20 years old, I would give CM. What I said is absolutely correct, that means

249
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:40,310
the remedy which is clear, is going to check every organ and put back into order.

250
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:50,630
Every organ on the system work fully, then the system, the emotions, the mental

251
00:32:50,730 --> 00:33:04,240
everything, the physical body... To do this when you are not 25, he is 2 times 25.

252
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,960
-More.

253
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:34,460
-Yes he is 60. Bring a man of 60 to the state of 26 is a big thing, you have to be a little bit careful.

254
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:45,460
You can give 50M, yes sure but the aggravation is going to be very strong.

255
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:49,200
Maybe he will start having palpitations for 20 days.

256
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:59,440
-Concerning the potencies I have a question. There is homeopaths that say if a potency

257
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:05,690
is absolutely right, there will be no aggravation at all. Do you have any thoughts to that?

258
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:13,940
-Yes sure, I have said my thoughts. This is nonsense. You can have aggravation with 12

259
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,960
with 30, with 200, with anything.

260
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:25,520
-Is it depending on the previous diseases? The diseases the patient has had and we

261
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,520
know them out of his history?

262
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:40,020
-Yes absolutely. Still you can not know the exact condition of the system, of the organs

263
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:48,770
of the body, even if all the laboratory examinations that we have available at this moment

264
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:52,520
don't show the real condition of the organs.

265
00:34:52,620 --> 00:35:09,520
They are so grossly. But I'll tell you my opinion is that the breaking down of an organ in

266
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:25,020
the body is going like this. At this stage, which is X state, from that state onward

267
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,120
laboratory examinations become positive.

268
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:41,950
You have laboratory findings for the liver but the liver one day before, if you had examine it,

269
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:48,470
let us say you examine the day where it changes. It's one day before.

270
00:35:49,480 --> 00:36:00,370
That is why you give the remedy here and 2-3 days later you see the laboratory findings

271
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,220
are gone.

272
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:14,120
But in the meantime how do you know in which condition it is? Is that condition which is

273
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:23,290
very good or it is that condition which is very close to break down the organ, the heart

274
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:27,890
the liver, the kidneys.

275
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:38,560
-I meant more the development of the patient. The miasmatic development.

276
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:49,660
-I don't understand the question. You're talking about this specific patient or in general?

277
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,230
-In general.

278
00:36:52,720 --> 00:37:04,980
-Yes, you can say that he is not complicated in miasmatic conditions.

279
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:16,100
But he has been suffering for many years with all this 'jacket' and the 'enemies' he calls

280
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,700
that he has been battling and not being able to enjoy.

281
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:27,960
In spite of the fact, his miasmatic condition is not very heavy.

282
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:42,590
If it was heavier you would not see such a clear picture. You would see Sulphur but not so clear

283
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,590
and then another remedy would be showing already.

284
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:57,650
-I think you gave him Ignatia 10M.
-50M.

285
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:04,910
-Was that because it was mainly a mental disease, that you went so high?

286
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:13,490
-Yes, it was because I knew that was not the remedy, which is deeper.

287
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:23,730
It was the uppermost layer and the grief was very deep and I had to give a high

288
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:26,330
potency to get it out, the grief.

289
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:34,740
But the grief was a layer which was imprinted upon this organism.

290
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:46,060
He didn't come to life with this miasm, the Ignatia constitution, let's say.

291
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,820
The Ignatia was imprinted because of circumstances of his life.

292
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:04,910
It's needed as a first remedy. You may give him Sulphur, as much Sulphur as you like

293
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:10,580
before Ignatia, nothing. Now it's going to act.

294
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:18,480
-You have to give some remedies essentially high, like you always have to give Ignatia

295
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:22,470
in a 50M or in 10M or Nat. mur.?

296
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:41,350
-No. If he was a very typical Ignatia case with his constitutional Ignatia, I would have given lower.

297
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:47,920
But I could see behind there was another layer coming.

298
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:59,420
So I had to deal with this issue of grief that was upon his life and put him in a state

299
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,770
where he could not breathe anymore.

300
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:11,470
-I have a question. If I have a woman that has a dilatation of the left ventricle, she has arthritis,

301
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:19,090
the family history have a number of colon carcinoma and she has a lot of polyps

302
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:28,580
in the colon got a Nitric acid in a C30 which did very well and then a C200, can I go

303
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,930
further up to 1M?

304
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:42,750
-If she has done already very good in 30 and 200 and she has relapsed now, she can go

305
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:43,850
to 1M, yes.

306
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:53,500
Like in his case from 200 if we see the relapse comes after. If he feels good for a period

307
00:40:53,600 --> 00:41:01,350
of years and an aggravation he feels good for 5-6 months, comes back, then we go to 1M

308
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:11,000
we go to 10M, we go to CM, no problem, as long as we go slowly as we go up.

309
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:22,850
We don't go straight away. You may give a high potency, there is no question but in 60...
