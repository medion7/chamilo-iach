1
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:36,580
I'd like to show you another case and to show you another aspect of wrong prescribing,

2
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,330
how wrong prescribing pushed the disease into the inside.

3
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:51,990
You will see how she will describe it and also you will see again the picture of the remedy.

4
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:58,740
Before, I'll tell you a little story concerning Arsenicum.

5
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,060
In 1966 I visited London and I visited Sir John Weir.

6
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,790
Do you remember Sir John Weir? A big homeopath from England,

7
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,640
a big teacher who was teaching at the Faculty.

8
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,650
By the time I visited him he must have been about 75 or 78 years old.

9
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:31,290
That was 66-67 in London. I visited him and he had a butler.

10
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:39,720
He took me to see him. He didn't greet me.

11
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:45,960
He sat in his table, he pulled a case and he said you are the homeopath from Athens?

12
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,850
Yes, yes.

13
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:59,060
He reads his case and said what did I give him? I said Arsenicum.

14
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:08,210
He said I did not give Arsenicum, I gave Nux vomica and he came after a month

15
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:15,560
and he said that there was no action at all and then I gave him Arsenicum

16
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,750
Then he came after a month and he read me the report.

17
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,250
He was better in this, better in this, worse in this. What did I give him then?

18
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:32,800
I said sac lac.  What is your name? I'm very glad to meet you and we became friends.

19
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,050
He dedicated all his books to me etc.

20
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,470
To show you that he was a great homeopath.

21
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,890
What I want to show you in this is the fastidious element,

22
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,040
the fastidious element is in Nux vomica as well and the irritability sometimes it's there.

23
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:13,290
The worse cold and there is a possibility that you may confuse this.

24
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:19,540
Also the fastidiousness is with Thuja. Thuja is very fastidious.

25
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:28,530
I don't know if I have given you the additions, is in the additions Thuja?

26
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:34,400
Carcinosin and Thuja, especially Thuja, can be as fastidious as Arsenicum.

27
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,890
Let us see another case.

28
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:31,460
-This is AC, she is almost 30.

29
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,950
At first I saw her in July last year and she is actually referred to me

30
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,780
by another acupuncturist who had tried to treat her with not very much success.

31
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,540
She was complaining of genital herpes that occurred twice monthly,

32
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:57,040
itching all over her body which she gets any time and anywhere on her body

33
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,890
but it's actually worse in the genital region.

34
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:09,950
She has itching in the vagina, which the hospital have diagnosed as microscopic warts,

35
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,380
she also get an inflammation of the eye that can be either eyes,

36
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,380
her eyes get very inflamed and red.

37
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,450
She has a great fear of dirt, of contagion, she is ever washing her hands

38
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,490
and she has a disgust about touching, particularly in her own body.

39
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,890
She is also prone about some diarrhea and hemorrhoids.

40
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:55,540
Generally she is also very tired but she said that she doesn't get often colds.

41
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:04,040
Her sleep is disturbed by the itching and also by pains which she gets on the rectum.

42
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,800
-The itching is all over her body?

43
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,370
-She gets to different parts all over her body; it can be the arms, the legs,

44
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:18,230
the face, her trunk but it's more constant in the genital region as well.

45
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,620
She has a history of stomach ulcer which was treated by [drug name]

46
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,470
I'm not sure how long ago, maybe some years ago.

47
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:39,070
Besides, the diarrhea... in the hospital they mentioned colitis but she never

48
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,830
had a definite diagnosis.

49
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,570
The hemorrhoids have pain and they bleed.

50
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:04,920
She took the pill 4-5 years ago because she had heavy periods, heavy menses.

51
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:13,910
She stopped the pill and her menses had been quite irregular and she said she had headaches

52
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:19,510
and extra growth in the pubic hair since she stopped the pill.

53
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,660
She desires sweet fruits, very strongly, three underlined and vinegar.

54
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,500
She also likes liver and mayonnaise.

55
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:52,510
She is aversed to things like snails and tapioca..

56
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:07,160
She has little thirst and she drinks many fizzy drinks, alcohol, vodka and wine.

57
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,160
She said she is a chilly person but her hands are warm,

58
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,910
she doesn't suffer with cold extremities particularly.

59
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:23,160
She worries a lot and she said she's closed, she doesn't have many friends.

60
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,400
She gets very depressed about her symptoms and she would cry about her symptoms.

61
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,100
She has a great fear for the future and because of her phobia she can't work.

62
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:47,990
She does very open a relationship with a man who was a professional gambler

63
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,910
and she says that the relationship is not longer a sexual relationship

64
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,260
but she needs to have someone there.

65
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:08,790
She has a great sense of worthlessness about herself and she also worries a great deal

66
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,140
about her mother. She mentioned her mother.

67
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,030
She wants to be clean all the time, she baths a lot,

68
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:30,970
she won't have carpets in her flat because she likes to wash the floor and disinfect it.

69
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:36,900
She said the first time it started she was at school, she was about 12,

70
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:43,110
it had started with a fear of becoming pregnant, which she still has.

71
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,360
-She doesn't want to be pregnant?

72
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,710
-I asked her, it's not that she doesn't want, she just has the fear of it.

73
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:07,530
-Many times they've asked me how did I produce Materia Medica?

74
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:14,290
How did I have this information? Just by observing these cases.

75
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,700
Take the common factors that run through these cases

76
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,550
and you will see the picture of the remedy.

77
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:32,450
There is an element of limitation in general in Arsenicum.

78
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:39,800
This element comes from insecurity. The insecurity appearing in different ways.

79
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:52,550
Also you will see in Arsenicum there is no much sexual energy.

80
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,040
Yet they want somebody to have as company, that's desire for company,

81
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,640
you will find it in books desire for company.

82
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,530
They desire for cleanliness and order in one way or another,

83
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,890
they will go through.

84
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,800
Almost in all cases it will be underlined a state of anxiety.

85
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:34,700
Mostly anxiety about health matters, fear of different kind of diseases

86
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
and finally fear of death.

87
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:51,540
What is most important with Arsenicum is to have this urge for order,

88
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,780
this fastidiousness and at the same time a limited individual,

89
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,890
an individual who is not broad minded.

90
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,870
They are concerned around themselves, they are revoving around themselves

91
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,970
and around their own symptomatology and pathology.

92
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,390
I have this and I have that, they complain and they revolve around themselves,

93
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,470
around their own elements.

94
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:30,400
The selfish element is in a particular way.

95
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:37,150
Because you saw this woman, a selfishness on another level,

96
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:43,250
I do everything correct. I'm super.

97
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,150
And when it breaks down, it comes to the other state of despair.

98
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,500
I'm nothing, I'm worthless.

99
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,990
You will see for instance Arsenicum indicated in women,

100
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:03,230
where they have performed their duties, they raised their children,

101
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:09,240
they have gone through menopause things and now they are 55-60

102
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,580
and the children they get married.

103
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:21,230
Nobody from the family wants anymore the help from the mother

104
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:29,320
and suddenly the mother feels worthless, without mission, without anything to go ahead

105
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,730
and to go on with it.

106
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:37,980
And she feels completely in the air and you will get a tremendous anxiety during that time.

107
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:44,480
When a woman comes, she says this is an anxiety which comes from insecurity,

108
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,480
she has nothing to cling on anymore. She says everybody has gone

109
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,080
from the house. All the children are gone and now what?

110
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:02,100
Then it comes the fear, the anxiety, as if life has finished, the end is coming.

111
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:20,240
The Arsenicum individuals have been enjoying life, put things in order, they enjoy that

112
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:28,060
and as soon as the problem comes, then life becomes difficult.

113
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,900
Otherwise they enjoy.

114
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:37,880
Can you imagine somebody dressing, he is very happy with his appearance?

115
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:48,880
The appearance is of great important for Arsenicum and it has to be meticulous.

116
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,620
The more meticulous...

117
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,310
If you observe a woman, you'll observe the way she paints her eyelids.

118
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:04,810
She gives you impression of perfection, that is a case of Arsenicum.

119
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,550
The way she dresses, perfection, case of Arsenicum.

120
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:13,150
The way she paints her face, perfect.

121
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,970
Then they will not cry, why? Because crying will bring up...

122
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:28,970
They are going to be in pain... some spots.

123
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:38,130
She can't tolerate these spots, so she will not cry. Then limits, limits.

124
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,880
Then we have the other situation that we saw first, tremendous limitation.

125
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:46,520
Nothing moves.

126
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:09,220
-She's fearful of people... she doesn't like to be touched.

127
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:18,160
The itching on her skin generally started soon after she met her boyfriend

128
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,130
about six years ago.

129
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,420
She said she didn't have the itching until she met him.

130
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:27,910
She also said that she contracted... her initial outbreak of herpes

131
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,380
after she met her boyfriend.

132
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,960
The itching is worse at night and worse when she thinks about it.

133
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:47,810
It's better with warm bathing, she takes bath during the day.

134
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,800
The initial herpes started after she met her boyfriend,

135
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:59,400
she didn't have any herpes for two years and then when her father died...

136
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,050
-I'd like you to see the patient and to see how she describes this thing

137
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:14,460
and I would like you also to see something very interesting that happened.

138
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,420
As she described different remedies, what happened is

139
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,420
that the woman did not want others to touch her because she felt she was getting dirty

140
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,910
if she was touched by somebody. She had to wash if she touched anything outside.

141
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,260
The outside world was very dirty for her.

142
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:37,270
She took different remedies and you will see now what happened.

143
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:50,960
It doesn't matter whether the itching now is gone or is not gone.

144
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,960
Unless we see the whole picture of the case, what we are doing,

145
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:59,320
we are improving the case or we are degenerating the case?

146
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,550
Then that is the idea with Homeopathy.

147
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,050
You give a remedy for the itching Rhus venenata and the itching is better for a week,

148
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:16,390
it doesn't matter, you give another remedy for the itching, it doesn't matter.

149
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:40,900
-What is your main complaint?
-I feel rejected, rejecting myself.

150
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:51,650
-This is much more than pain?
-I'm not able to relax in my own body.

151
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:02,670
-You had a boyfriend who left? He came back and left?

152
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,520
-It's like 7 years, it's been like that.

153
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:17,410
Then last week he writes me a letter saying that he must go

154
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:21,480
because he is no good for me because he's a gambler.

155
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:29,150
He does bad things, he upsets me and I'm always trying to get him out of it...

156
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,850
-You have been upset by this incident very much?

157
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,840
-No, I've been upset with what he's giving me...

158
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:54,430
-But you are not upset because he left?
-Yes because I feel insecure.

159
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:07,160
-This state that you feel rejected this is lately strong?

160
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:15,260
-Yes if he comes back, I won't feel so rejected but I still reject my own body

161
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,660
because of contamination.

162
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,270
-You feel that your body has contaminated you and you reject it?

163
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,130
-Yes.

164
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,670
-Your mother is not alive?
-She is, she is in the States.

165
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,570
-You don't have a good relationship with her?

166
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,820
-We love one another very much but we've both gone through so much with my father

167
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:05,030
and when I went to live with her, I've been going through... found out

168
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,520
about everything... and on the top of that I had to find a job and everything...

169
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,770
But it didn't turn out like that because I was going through so much stress.

170
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,840
And then she lost all her money...

171
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,490
-You had to leave and come back.

172
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:47,090
-Due to my health. I feel within this year I've come forward from where I was.

173
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,490
-To what respect?

174
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:59,340
-I don't know. When I first arrived here I was terrible with feeling very contaminated.

175
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:42,490
-You have an almost obsession for cleanliness?

176
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,320
You have to wash to take away the contamination?

177
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:53,340
-Oh yes, before all that happened, I was...

178
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,490
with all those clothes, they had to be clean.

179
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:11,740
If I go pass a tram,  I go  in a panic, I have to wash my clothes and wash my hands

180
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,840
after doing a job and everything was in little piles, things like that.

181
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:25,090
If I touched a door handle and I didn't feel was clean, I didn't let my fingers.

182
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,740
My parents I didn't touch them for a period of time,

183
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,160
even the door handles I had my own tissues. That was prior to this...

184
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:43,660
Then I got a lot better but then this happened with Christopher

185
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:54,650
and now it's turned the other way. It's my own body I'm scared off. The phobia is still there.

186
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:10,510
I still hate hotels and beds where people slept in.

187
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,260
I still find a fear with beds in hotels and things which I don't feel they are clean.

188
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:30,490
I've got a lot better about things, like carpets, I wasn't able to do that.

189
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,090
To walk out of my back and on the floor.

190
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:47,100
-You reject yourself?
-...I reject them before they reject me.

191
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,240
I don't feel I have a proper, loving relationship because of that.

192
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,340
Also with Christopher we never had a proper relationship.

193
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:11,350
With his gambling he's never been interested in a loving relationship.

194
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:20,500
It's been a companionship. That has been difficult because we never go out together,

195
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,090
to enjoy an evening out.

196
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:34,440
-He gambles every night?
-Every day. He is obsessed with it.

197
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:55,330
-Did you know about your father whether he had any venereal disease?

198
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,190
-No.

199
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,930
-Do you have any other fear?

200
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:27,270
-I also got fear of death but it's not obsession, I'm not thinking of that all the time.

201
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:34,670
I have a fear of future, of not meeting anybody and being lonely.

202
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:40,600
That is very important to me. Loneliness, I get very depressed.

203
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,620
-You have a desire, you feel better with somebody?

204
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,790
-Yes.

205
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:04,170
When I take rubrics and I do differential diagnosis, desires company.

206
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:08,070
I say how and why each remedy desires company?

207
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:12,580
It's not desires company it's there or it's not there.

208
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,320
The idea is with the person understanding Arsenicum, understanding their needs,

209
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,660
their insecurities, what do they need? Why they need company?

210
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,240
Do they need company to converse? Do they need company to give some pleasure to the others?

211
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,740
Do they need company for themselves?

212
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,740
What is this insecure element which makes them desire for company?

213
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,340
This is the desire for company, this is the way that she expresses.

214
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:47,840
So you will have to understand the 3-dimensional picture of our remedies.

215
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,630
This is what I try to show you in this seminar.

216
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,940
It's not a flat desire for company. They are not going to say I desire for company.

217
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:08,830
This is how she is going to say it and then you have to perceive the need.

218
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:14,930
This is a need, desire for company. She is not feeling well when she is alone.

219
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,580
You can be looking in your Repertory, when she is alone

220
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,830
but you will perceive it in this way.

221
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,830
She is not going to give you the words of the Repertory.

222
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:31,180
She is going to give you the essence of the remedy.

223
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:45,670
What you will need more to confirm the diagnosis of Arsenicum?

224
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,390
Chilliness, worse cold, what else?

225
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:06,240
For instance, if you ask her how you drink and she will say in sips?

226
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:24,490
Also you will see in these cases the lack of responsibility, real responsibilities

227
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:31,530
they don't like. She doesn't want a child the Arsenicum.

228
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:37,340
Why she does not want a child? The responsibility is very great for her,

229
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,750
it is too much of a burden.

230
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,830
When somebody expects something from him in the Repertory, it gets very anxious.

231
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,840
Arsenicum gets very anxious.

232
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:35,580
-I don't want dust. It's not furnished at all, or got carpets, I don't stand on the floor.

233
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:45,990
If I change the sheets because the bed is old and the blankets I don't feel is that clean.

234
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:51,810
I won't put the blanket because I feel the blanket is dirty.

235
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:57,560
-Are you very fastidious with your clothes? Which one to wear?

236
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:03,910
-Not really, I have to see that they are clean.

237
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:14,570
If they got a mark and I know it's me that made the mark and I know what it is, it's fine.

238
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,170
If it's got a mark and I don't know what it is, then...

239
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:29,560
You see when the pathology goes on a deeper level, how the context changes?

240
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:38,570
Her pathology is fear she is contaminated, she is full of germs,

241
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:48,320
she rejects her body all the time, she is disgust. She has rejected her own body.

242
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:54,070
Where she was rejecting outside, now she has rejected her own body.

243
00:31:54,170 --> 00:32:05,560
Now once this fear comes upon, the other element of cleanliness is subdued.

244
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:11,070
What is this? I don't know where this came from. It may be full of germs.

245
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,060
That is important.

246
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:19,560
If she has something where she knows she spoiled, she put her milk in here

247
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,160
and she knows this is milk, she doesn't care.

248
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:28,640
With the pathology of Arsenicum on another level, which is not so deep,

249
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,310
she will care very much. Everything has to be absolutely meticulous.

250
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,810
Here the organism says, it doesn't matter.

251
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,910
What is important is germs, I don't want germs.

252
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:47,170
The pathology goes deeper. Then it changes the symptomatology, the way it appears.

253
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,170
Do you understand that?

254
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:05,310
Many times I've said in different remedies that once the pathology goes on a deeper level,

255
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:11,250
keynote symptoms disappear.

256
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:18,750
Calcarea carbonica has desire for sweets, desire for eggs, worse cold.

257
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,150
These are keynotes symptoms for Calcarea carbonica.

258
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:28,650
Let Calcarea carbonica become complete mental picture and develop tremendous fear of insanity,

259
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,740
fear of death, fear of disease and all these keynote symptoms will disappear.

260
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,840
No desire for sweets, no desire for eggs, not feeling so cold.

261
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:46,340
In another level of pathology and then the other portion of the organism is left normal.

262
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,580
Yes eggs I take, sweets I take. It's not a big deal.

263
00:33:54,090 --> 00:34:00,730
Bring the pathology down to physical level and you will see the desire for sweets increases,

264
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,420
coldness increases.

265
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:26,560
-You eat a lot of sweets?
-Not that many.

266
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,900
-But you like sweets?
-I like sweets.

267
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,410
-Very much?
-Yes.

268
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,400
-What about eggs, do you like them?

269
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,670
-Not really. I don't really like eggs so great.

270
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:43,150
-What about water? How much water do you drink?

271
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,750
-I wouldn't say I drink water every day.

272
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:55,750
-You would say medium or less than medium?
-I don't really drink that much water.

273
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:02,650
-If you drink water, how do you drink it? The whole thing or sip it?

274
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:09,500
-A cup I suppose. I like water.

275
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:19,250
If I drink a glass, I get breathless and I go dizzy.

276
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:28,240
-So how you drink it? You take it in cups or sips?

277
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:38,350
-Not in sips. If I have a drink in front of me, I'll drink it.

278
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:42,860
If I go out and I have a glass of water, I'll drink it.

279
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,590
If they bring it in front of me, I'll drink it fast. I'm a fast person.

280
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,230
-Your appetite is good?

281
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:03,330
-Yes, some days I can go like eating, other days I don't think about it.

282
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,190
-The examinations that you had in the clinics, did they examine your liver?

283
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:22,000
Do you know if they gave you liver tests?
-I don't know. I don't think so.

284
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,400
-Did you ever had any problems with your liver?

285
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,250
-I don't know.

286
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,170
-But you have an itching all over your body you said.

287
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,420
Now you still have the itching?
-Not so much.

288
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:41,020
-In the vagina?
-Yes but the last 3 weeks it has been good.

289
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,420
The general itching is gone, the itching of the vagina is almost gone

290
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,920
but she is going into pieces, the real disorder goes deeper and deeper.

291
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,920
Now she has rejected herself.

292
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:05,010
She doesn't appear to be suffering very much but now she is suffering much better.

293
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,000
This is the idea.

294
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,920
How long she is going to stand this feeling of being contaminated,

295
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:15,500
not being able to have a relationship because she is contaminated, rejected herself?

296
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:23,600
That is how she will be led into having suicidal disposition and suicidal tendencies.

297
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:34,590
As I said before, when you have this kind of pathology on this level,
