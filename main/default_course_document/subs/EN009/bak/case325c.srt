1
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,320
-Tell me how you are.

2
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:33,820
-After Staphysagria I was very angry. You gave me Staphysagria because

3
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:43,320
my emotional state was very heavy and with the Causticum I feel good in the

4
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:53,320
physical level but emotionally I was very angry and this anger was my sickness.

5
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:10,820
I was with fever, I was very sick in the winter and I told you that after the Causticum

6
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:26,820
I feel like I dropped out my heavy burden and after that I was very sick and you

7
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:38,920
asked me what is your problem and like a volcano all my emotions came out from the past.

8
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:53,820
I had also emotional pain about my mother that killed my child before it was born and

9
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:10,400
about my daughter that got married against my will and about my partner that lost

10
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:23,000
my medical center and a lot of other problems, my father was dead in certain period.

11
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:37,650
After Staphysagria I didn't feel something special but 3 weeks after somebody wanted

12
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:52,000
to meet me, a man and 7 years I was very close because I didn't want other problems.

13
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:04,500
For me men is a heavy problem and 20 years of marriage is trouble.

14
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,900
-So you met somebody.

15
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:23,820
-Suddenly I want to meet him and this I think was falling in love with the first sight.

16
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,070
-Very good.

17
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:38,580
-I was like in "Olympus" and all my emotional burden I think I transported from this plain

18
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,670
to another plain.

19
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:57,960
All my feeling that I thought it was dead, for a long time, 7 years I had

20
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:05,510
only homeopathic treatment and study and I was like monomaniac.

21
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:14,510
If I wanted to speak about something was only Homeopathy and only how to treat and

22
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:21,110
how to understand the patient and I was no interested in something else.

23
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:33,840
And this time this was 3 weeks after Staphysagria I feel that it's another thing

24
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,940
important for me.

25
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,690
-Another department of life.

26
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:57,550
-And my feeling was another level and I can cope with my reality, with my mother and

27
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,900
with my daughter.

28
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,630
-Everything becomes more easy.

29
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:18,380
-I was very lonely and I think that I get with me my daughter' s family because

30
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:36,300
I wanted them to demonstrate that I'm not alone but it was very difficult for me to study

31
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:47,150
and to be with my grandchildren and all this. It was not very good decision.

32
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:02,150
At the end of June I stopped to be alone.

33
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,050
-You live together now?

34
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:16,310
-Not all the time because I work very hard and I like my profession.

35
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,520
-Is he also a doctor?
-No he is a businessman.

36
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:36,140
We came together here, he was here for 1 week and it's

37
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:44,740
fine to feel that somebody can treat me and not I have to treat others.

38
00:06:45,980 --> 00:07:07,010
But in August I get a kind of burning on my soles, not pain and this was more and more strong.

39
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:23,620
This was not enough to put ventilator but at the time I can't stand on my feet

40
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,470
because of this burning pain.

41
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,970
-It's so much.

42
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:44,870
-If you remember 1 year before I came with a burning pain on my chest and cramps

43
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:51,970
on the calves and all these things disappeared.

44
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:23,200
I did a check up to cardiologist and he found that my LDL cholesterol is very high and the HDL

45
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:35,500
is very low and he wants to put me on medical treatment, I didn't take it.

46
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:55,870
All this pain that was 1 year before focused in my epigastrium and this is the same kind of pain

47
00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:25,960
and sometimes come up a constricting pain like a stone that came on the throat.

48
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:42,380
I speak with the gastrenterologue and he told me that this is stomach ulcer.

49
00:09:42,880 --> 00:10:10,830
My father had stomach cancer and I did ulcer when I was a medical student but this

50
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:20,770
was gone and after Staphysagria came back in the same symptoms.

51
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,420
-As strong as it was?

52
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:33,260
-More strong and more painful and I was afraid about this pain.

53
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:43,390
-The last time here you had pain in the abdomen and you had to bend double. How is that pain?

54
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:57,610
-In the same way but only in one limited area, not on the chest as it was.

55
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:05,610
-It was in the abdomen.
-No, it was on the chest.

56
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:12,690
-6 months before, last June, you said you had pain in abdomen.

57
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:24,450
-No, somebody else translated for me but I said to chest.

58
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:58,920
I sent you a fax about this pain and the burning pain on my soles and you wrote me that

59
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,770
I can take Medorrhinum 1M.

60
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:15,470
I'm afraid to take Medorrhinum because of my work and I took it one day after that I came here,

61
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,470
2 weeks ago.

62
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,470
-You took Medorrhinum 1M or 200?

63
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:34,140
-Yes and I have some symptoms after the Medorrhinum. One of them is I'm tired and

64
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:58,240
I feel like floating, not dizziness, like I'm not here but in other place.

65
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:10,640
I don't concentrate and I have a sort of restlessness internal. I'm very impatient,

66
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:24,390
I can't stay a lot of time in the chair, I have to go out, to come in all the time.

67
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:37,640
I have problem with my sleep, all day I'm very tired but in the night I can't sleep.

68
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,740
I want to dance 3 hours.

69
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:50,320
-You go to disco.
-I can't sleep in the night.

70
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,060
-The sleep comes late or you fall asleep and you wake up?

71
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:06,560
-I sleep for a sort time and then I wake and after that I have to do something because

72
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:14,640
I can't only lie, I have to get up and to do something.

73
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,640
-Then you go back and you sleep again.
-For an hour.

74
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:25,560
-And then you wake up again.
-Yes.

75
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,400
-It goes like this. How many times you wake up in the night?

76
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,490
-Last night it was 3 times.

77
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,390
-Do you have to eat something?

78
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:42,890
-I put on weight, 3 kilos in 2 weeks because all the time I want to eat.

79
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,640
-In the night?

80
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:53,410
-In the night, in the day, every 4 hours. I'm hungry, I want to eat.

81
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,110
-But how is the burning in the feet?

82
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:27,770
-Something happened on my soles, in the right leg the skin is very hard, it's like callosity

83
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:37,120
but it's not this. It was yellow patch and after that...

84
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:54,410
-Is it hard?
-Yes and very hot and this place is burning.

85
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:01,370
-Not all the foot?
-All the foot but this place more.

86
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,770
-Is there any itching there?
-No.

87
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:11,020
-What about your desire for salt?

88
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:20,370
-More, more. I eat salt with food, not food with salt.

89
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:31,270
-And you said aversion sweets. You still don't like or you start eating sweets?

90
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:37,620
-I eat sometimes but I really don't like them.

91
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:57,460
I have another problem that this was in my past. Back pain in the lower region.

92
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:11,610
I told you that 7 years ago when I began to learn homeopathic study, I suffered from

93
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:19,460
the low back problem with the spine, the vertebrae.

94
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,200
-She must have an operation.

95
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,040
-She was told she must have an operation.

96
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,790
-She had hernia.

97
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:46,460
And every month I have to lie for 1 week.

98
00:17:51,280 --> 00:18:07,430
I took Lil. tigr. and I was with very big aggravation and after 3 weeks all these things

99
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:18,280
disappeared and after 1 year I was OK.

100
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,880
And now this pain reminds me of that pain.

101
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:32,450
-But it is starting, it's not as strong as it was. It's only a little bit now?

102
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:53,800
-No. Massage is very good for me. Every morning I wake up with stiffness all the back.

103
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,620
I can't move.

104
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:09,610
-Where do you feel mostly this stiffness?
-All the back.

105
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:17,370
-Or from lumbar to here, or from sacral to cervical, or mostly dorsal?

106
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:38,490
-Here lumbar and shoulder but the dorsal too is stiffness, I can't move for an hour.

107
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:50,450
I come to wash my face not in this way, only in this way.

108
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,540
-And after an hour you get used.
-Yes.

109
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:05,540
-How is your thirst?
-With all the salt that I eat is strong.

110
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,940
-Cold?
-Ice cold.

111
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,290
-You like ice cream?

112
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:24,290
-I don 't like sweets but more ice cream than cakes.

113
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:35,570
-Your reaction to weather?

114
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:49,190
-Wet is very bad for me and cold too but wet especially. I like the sea very much.

115
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,290
I feel good in the sea.

116
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:03,540
-You feel rejuvenated?
-In emotional level too.

117
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:19,940
I feel that I'm very calm. If I have every day work I can get a ride to the sea in Tel Aviv

118
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,790
at the end of the week and I feel good.

119
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:39,690
-Do you eat fruits?
-Not so much.

120
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:44,040
-Not good for the stomach.

121
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,780
-The position in bed?
-Only to the right side.

122
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:10,930
Now after the Medorrhinum I like to be on the abdomen but not for long time because I smoke

123
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:17,530
and it's very difficult for me to breathe.

124
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:49,780
Dancing and gymnastic I feel very good after. Aerobic only. I have to jump.

125
00:22:52,780 --> 00:23:02,090
-Do you feel very much in a hurry, you have to do quickly?

126
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:12,880
-Yes, I'm very intense because of that. I feel that thing inside, not always I come to

127
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,670
do these things physically quickly.

128
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,130
-When you dance you perspire a lot?

129
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:37,130
-Only on the head. It's like I go to do bath in the shower.

130
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,910
-Face or head?
-She knows because she saw me.

131
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:57,050
-How is your sexual energy?
-Volcano.

132
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:20,050
And he was here only 1 week. Maybe next year I bring him 2 weeks.

133
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:59,500
The evaluation of the remedy that she took. She has been doing very well in Causticum

134
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:06,600
and then in Staphysagria, then she sent me a fax for which I prescribed Medorrhinum.

135
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:16,690
Is Medorrhinum a remedy which is acting at this moment, yes or no?

136
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,190
-Yes.

137
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:31,590
-Let me see the fax what is was saying in the fax. Since the first fax, she sent another

138
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:40,360
fax before, I sent you my burning pain in my soles has increased. That is the last one.

139
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:52,290
There was a fax before for which I said nothing?

140
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,110
-Maybe Medorrhinum but wait.

141
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:14,390
-Mr Vithoulkas has read the fax and we are happy to hear about it. He says that there is

142
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:20,640
a possibility of Medorrhinum but you should not take it yet, seen that you are feeling better.

143
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:26,840
So please wait. So you waited and then you sent this fax.

144
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,230
In which you said the burning on the soles has increased.

145
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:42,990
Now it reoccurs every night especially worse 4-5 a.m. Maybe this is because of high temperature

146
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:50,210
in Jerusalem in Israel now but that bothers me a lot, especially during the night.

147
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,560
It's very difficult for me to rest.

148
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:10,290
I find it difficult to fall asleep and each night I wake till 12 to 1 and only then I fall asleep

149
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,890
but I wake up because of the burning feeling in my soles.

150
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,140
In the morning I'm very tired and during the day too.

151
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:30,220
Because it was very strange for me that you write only my soles are burning and I tell

152
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:44,970
you just take Medorrhinum. My last blood analysis results show a decrease in high LDL

153
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:59,070
and increase in low but in general I feel very good, I'm happy now with my friend etc.

154
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,070
I would appreciate...

155
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:08,220
I had a few strange symptoms that I can't find them in Repertory.

156
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:16,220
During my sleep I felt like a stone that rose from the stomach constrictive spastic pain to

157
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:23,630
the esophagus towards my throat and it's stuck there, the stone and after a few minutes

158
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:36,130
I have to regurgitate much saliva or stomach fluid but not sour and without pain.

159
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:42,480
I felt as a hand squeezing and I do not know what this can be.

160
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,630
My results are OK from the laboratory.

161
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,890
I would like you to know that my father died from stomach cancer.

162
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:56,130
Three symptoms were only 2-3 times but enough to frighten me.

163
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:00,880
In your latest fax you mention to take Medorrhinum. I didn't take yet.

164
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:05,100
If you still think I should take, please let me know.

165
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:15,340
Mr Vithoulkas finds that the font that you use to send your faxes is very difficult to read

166
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,840
Can you please send it in italic?

167
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:41,510
And I said you can take a dose of Medorrhinum 1M. So this is the whole story.

168
00:29:41,610 --> 00:30:07,280
Now she took, she is already now 11 days. 21 of September? 10 days.

169
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:31,930
More or less, it's OK. 10 days is still close to evaluate whether the remedy is acting and

170
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:39,930
we have to wait, we can not give another remedy. The only thing we can say is that

171
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:49,340
maybe there is a possibility of Sulphur but I will not advice you to take Sulphur.

172
00:30:49,440 --> 00:31:00,440
Just be patient, let the remedy act because your amelioration is quite strong.

173
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,290
-Very strong.

174
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:10,360
-So just be patient and wait, don't take another remedy and I think things will go all right.

175
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:34,760
Last time we decided to wait for the time being?

176
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,860
-No, I took Medorrhinum when I was here.

177
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,760
-Here it's written possibility Sulphur.

178
00:31:52,860 --> 00:32:03,640
-No, I sent you a fax and you give an answer that I can take.

179
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,010
-Medorrhinum what potency?
-200.

180
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:17,860
-Where is the fax? This is what I say, there is no fax here.

181
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,860
Do you have the fax with you?
-No, no.

182
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,540
-So what happened? You remember why you asked me?

183
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:57,360
-I remember. I took before Medorrhinum, Staphysagria.

184
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,860
-You took yourself?
-No I took here in the turn before.

185
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:24,870
-And then you came here and you said that and you did not receive a remedy here in September.

186
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,610
No remedy.

187
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:34,610
-No, I took it 1 week before the last follow up.

188
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:49,360
-Medorrhinum 200.

189
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:21,110
-And why did you ask for a remedy?
-I had burning feet.

190
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:44,610
-That's all?
-But I couldn't walk.

191
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:54,780
It was very extreme this burning feet and at night especially I couldn't rest.

192
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:08,180
-If she looks at all the picture something very special happened.

193
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,430
-What it is?

194
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:19,930
-After taking Staphysagria I could confront my heavy and difficult things with my mother

195
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:31,440
with my daughter, all the difficulties, they became different.

196
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,540
-What does she mean different?

197
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:47,250
-She started to see all the things much more beautiful. She stopped being alone,

198
00:35:47,350 --> 00:36:00,250
she allowed herself to know somebody but this man I knew was not honest enough for me.

199
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:05,760
I felt it from the very beginning but I really did not want to be alone and I went into this

200
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:13,000
relationship but I felt this relationship is not healthy for me and I had the feeling I fell

201
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:20,850
in love for the love, not for this person.

202
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:25,500
-Just because she was feeling good, she fell in love.

203
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:37,600
-Yes. I was very open and all surrounding was very beautiful for me and very easy.

204
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:43,250
The life was suddenly easy.

205
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:51,270
-And interesting again.
-Yes and I wanted it to live too.

206
00:36:51,370 --> 00:37:04,590
-These feelings were due to the relationship?
-I don't know, it was after Staphysagria.

207
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:17,740
My work was easy and I enjoyed my work and I work very many hours the day.

208
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:24,490
-But in your mind you knew that this relationship was not good.

209
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:39,480
-Yes I felt it because I treated him before that. He was my patient and he had many problems,

210
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:49,330
he then was in a process of divorce himself. He needed treatment to calm

211
00:37:50,100 --> 00:38:00,340
down and because he was in the same picture with me, I gave him Staphysagria.

212
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:18,150
-After she gave him Staphysagria, he felt much better and he stopped taking medication

213
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,950
but he also left her.

214
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:34,850
He went back to Argentina, his origin country to finish this business there and he left

215
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:37,700
and he took away with him 10.000 $.

216
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,920
-Her money?
-Her money.

217
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,740
She was for 3 months under deep depression.

218
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,430
-When it was that?

219
00:38:50,120 --> 00:39:05,590
-They were here together in October and in December I was in this situation.

220
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:16,080
I couldn't sleep neither eat, I lost weight 8-10 kilos, concentration.

221
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,080
She took Medorrhinum in October, it was after Medorrhinum.

222
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,650
-What potency?

223
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:55,730
-200 and I have reaction, headache for 3 days and all the time I wanted to sleep but

224
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,870
I was very tired.

225
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:10,480
After Ignatia I also was for 2 months in deep depression.

226
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:26,080
I couldn't enjoy and I did not want to go out of home.

227
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,520
I did not want anyone to approach me or to talk to anyone.

228
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,230
I went to work much more intensively, much harder.

229
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:42,400
Something I had always, I told you from first meeting, this feeling of no lack,

230
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:51,750
no fortune in life is strengthened 10 times more this feeling.

231
00:40:53,750 --> 00:41:05,000
That I'm unfortunate in all the life.

232
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:30,150
I took Nat. mur. 1M, I ate a lot of salty things then, I wanted to cry and I could not.

233
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:40,060
I had internal grief, very heavy, the problems that I had with my mother that I had no patience

234
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,400
to her came again, that time again I had a lot of arguments with my daughter.

235
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:52,400
I wanted just to be left alone, that's what I know to do, how to do and that's it.

236
00:41:53,650 --> 00:42:01,510
So it's very hard, very difficult for me and I decided to go to psychotherapy. I think at the

237
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:08,320
end I started to treat this psychotherapist, I started to treat her.

238
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:25,520
I still feel sad, as if I don't have my place socially and I'm still staying home but

239
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:35,360
I enjoy work very much, especially that I have successes all my life and at this moment

240
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:41,440
I don't feel I need somebody near me but it's very hard with this loneliness,

241
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,440
with this being alone.

242
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:56,290
On the one hand I don't trust, I don't have the trust and this fear to be hurt again.

243
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:06,450
On the other hand the Staphysagria and the other treatment you gave me, did something to me

244
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,440
and I feel more a woman.

245
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:22,940
These two things is hard for me to confront. I have ups and downs.

246
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,190
It's easier for me to see the beauty, the nice things and colors.

247
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:35,130
When I go back home is again to get into my place, home.

248
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:40,710
-Restricted.
-Very much.

249
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,210
-She is still sighing?

250
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:52,890
-It's hard for me to talk about this now. That's why I'm sighing. Usually I'm not sighing.

251
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:57,610
Before I took Ignatia I had no air and I was sighing a lot.

252
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:18,460
Now I'm not anymore but I think part of this depression is left inside, I feel it in the down state.

253
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,210
-You can not get out of it. Tell me something.

254
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:39,140
The desire for salt is still there, strong?
-I like it more than other.

255
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:51,640
-And also aversion sweets?
-I eat but I don't like, I have no craving.

256
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,790
-Also your afternoon sleep?

257
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:11,380
-It's something that I forgot because it's pathological one. My suffering is more emotional

258
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:28,880
now but I want this follow up because now I wake every night a lot of times. I got to sleep

259
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:40,690
and after I wake up, I fall asleep easily but all the time I wake up and I have vertigo.

260
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,590
-When you wake up?

261
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:53,840
-No, all the time, when I work, when I raise up my hands I have vertigo for a few seconds

262
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,690
recently more frequently.

263
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:04,840
After taking Staphysagria and Medorrhinum and the fear I had I have needs like every woman,

264
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:16,440
sexual desire. Every night is more difficult and I take cold bath, it's very difficult

265
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:24,540
-To calm down. Let me understand something. After this man left,

266
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,100
did she take again Staphysagria?
-No.

267
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:39,010
-She took Ignatia and Nat. mur. What happened is, why she is in that state is because

268
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:47,820
Ignatia and Nat. mur. were not correct. She should have taken Staphysagria immediately.

269
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:55,340
-I took but I'm afraid to take more than 30.

270
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:05,580
-You have to take Staphysagria 50M now to get out of the depression.

271
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:20,220
-I think that it's something else, as an homeopath I distinguish my symptoms as Conium state.

272
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:29,080
I can't hold my head. It falls.

273
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:42,230
I have heaviness in my lids I sweat a lot in the night and I wake up with this perspiration,

274
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:47,330
I have to take a bath and this vertigo that I mentioned before.

275
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:54,760
-Did she take a dose of Conium 30?
-No, I didn't take.

276
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:05,760
-The vertigo as I understood is not strong vertigo, it's just for a moment.

277
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:24,760
-But after that I feel not very well, I have such weakness, I have to sit.

278
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:34,700
What bothers me is the need to be together and the fear to be hurt again.

279
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:53,150
Before Staphysagria I have good defense mechanics but the Staphysagria broke a little bit

280
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:55,410
my defense mechanism.

281
00:48:55,510 --> 00:49:04,760
I had my life very strong and after that I got hurt, I was more open and I got hurt.

282
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:10,900
-What can we do?

283
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
-I'm not expecting that you will solve my problems.

284
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:27,500
-If she takes Staphysagria 50M in one month all these will stay back.

285
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,650
It doesn't matter whether she will have another relationship or not, it doesn't matter.

286
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:43,900
What will happen is the organism will feel more balanced and she will have less sexual thoughts,

287
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:53,930
more balance, more calmness and more defense. No Conium. If you want to take Conium

288
00:49:54,030 --> 00:50:04,650
first take Conium. After Staphysagria, later you may need Nat. mur. but now she needs

289
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:08,250
Staphysagria after this disappointment.

290
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:18,400
She felt she was betrayed by this man because he was not only left but took her money,

291
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:29,660
it was a kind of betrayal. Now she took Ignatia she took Nat. mur. no effect.

292
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,620
She will take Staphysagria again and she will come.

293
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:42,770
-Mr. Vithoulkas is a very important question. If she takes today or tomorrow morning

294
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:48,200
Staphysagria 50M can she go on with the exam? It's very important for her.

295
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:55,930
-She does not have to take it today or tomorrow. She can take it on Saturday or Sunday

296
00:50:56,030 --> 00:51:04,450
because maybe there is a reaction, I don't know. Maybe you have fever or you want to

297
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:06,380
sleep all the time.

298
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:29,030
-After eating I'm very sleepy and if I have time to sleep I don't want to sleep because after

299
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:40,380
that I feel very bad, dizziness and very bad, depression.

300
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:04,270
-What she says, I feel very unfortunate, she knows this is a symptom of Staphysagria?

301
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,610
-No.

302
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,860
-She did not know.

303
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:16,610
-It 's difficult to see myself. I know Staphysagria but when I have to make my decision

304
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:24,460
is very heavy for me to see me in this detail.

305
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:35,040
-That is true but still...

306
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:54,720
-I think I'm a little proud because of being beaten by life and I feel very hard.

307
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:04,210
-You see the problem comes with the mother mostly where she suppressed so much

308
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:11,060
anger that after Causticum, Staphysagria is coming to bring out the anger.

309
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:20,560
Now she goes back with her mother, with her daughter, she goes back to Staphysagria.

310
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:28,310
If you take Staphysagria, you will forgive them.

311
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:34,710
-If she takes Staphysagria 50M, she can come back to the course next year?

312
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:36,640
-Sure why not?

313
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:57,790
-I don't know what is going to happen. I don't know where I will be, which place.

314
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:06,040
Staphysagria did so much for her, by opening that she said, her defense mechanism

315
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,890
so who knows where?

316
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:20,390
I made a lot of mistakes after Staphysagria. It was a feeling as if it's not me.

317
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:37,790
-No, it's you, it's the opposite. If you want to have no feelings and you want to have closeness

318
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:41,290
that is not health.

319
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:46,140
Health is when you have feelings and all that.

320
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:56,540
Now you can look and not make a big mistake because you saw that this man is not good.

321
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,290
-I felt it.

322
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:13,540
-You felt it but you did not follow your feelings. Staphysagria was very good but you did

323
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:20,400
not follow it. You saw this man, you liked him, you said let's see.

324
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:30,540
You were open to him and that is natural. It's not real that because long time you stayed by yourself,

325
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:38,790
then you opened there is somebody etc. That is perfectly human and perfectly understandable

326
00:55:38,890 --> 00:55:55,480
but still your organism said to you, don't do it. That's why it makes you very very sad.

327
00:55:55,580 --> 00:56:08,660
Also it makes you very sad because you felt he exploited you and that is indignation.

328
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,660
-Very much.

329
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:25,910
-So this is indignation, you can not tolerate and you want revenge.

330
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:40,900
-After the three months that I took Ignatia and after that Nat. mur. I came back to my state

331
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:52,780
with a lot of feeling that if I take revenge, I will feel better and I go to the advocate.

332
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:58,400
-You tried to catch him.

333
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:05,500
-I'm still trying with a lawyer. This is a good feeling for me.

334
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:14,750
-With Staphysagria you can do it, you can go to the lawyer but the feelings will be good.

335
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:29,580
Different. You say he did wrong to me, he has to pay back the money with some interest.

336
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,160
He must pay some interest also.

337
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,610
-But the feat that Staphysagria caused her openness?

338
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:47,060
-Staphysagria does not cause openness. Staphysagria brought back her real state.

339
00:57:47,160 --> 00:58:00,420
She is emotionally again like 19 years old, she is not a woman of 50.

340
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:16,560
You are 25, 26 at the most, that is the emotions you had by that time.

341
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:28,160
The organism comes back to the emotional state that was there as a girl, when you first had...

342
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:37,660
-When I was a girl I think that my feeling was that my mother stole my childhood.

343
00:58:47,250 --> 00:59:03,680
All the time I run to test this, what is it and I stayed there and I feel that sometimes

344
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,530
I'm childish.

345
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:11,430
-You are not childish. In your mind you are very clever.

346
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:19,400
Also you have the experience of life but not experience in this area.

347
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:27,400
That's why your organism told you to wait but you did not know what to do with that and you went

348
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:33,730
along feeling very nice feelings for the first time.

349
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:40,070
It's like falling in love for the first time, when you are 19, 20 and always you make a mistake

350
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:42,920
during this period.

351
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:52,310
But to have such feelings is a blessing, it's very good. You have to enjoy it.

352
00:59:52,410 --> 01:00:02,410
You have to bring back these feelings again, you will see take this and you will see what happens.

353
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:20,550
But if you want to close it's easy, you take every day Nat. mur. 1M, after a month you close totally,

354
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:21,900
no feelings nothing.

355
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:35,050
Later maybe you will need one dose of Nat. mur., maybe after a year or two years.

356
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:44,550
I don't know but first you have to counteract the anger, what is suppressed to have the

357
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,160
feeling and then...

358
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,070
-OK.
