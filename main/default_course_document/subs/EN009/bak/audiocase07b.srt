1
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,570
-Yes.

2
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,230
-A long trip.

3
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,580
-Which country?
-All over India...

4
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,310
-Did you have sexual partners there?

5
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:43,340
-Not in what the school medicine tends to say is the risk of getting infected,

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,680
not that kind of sex.

7
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,340
So I think I must have been infected in Paris or in Barcelona,

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,220
I was in a weekend trip in Barcelona or in Copenhagen.

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,520
Because now we know the high numbers of infected in these places compared to Oslo.

10
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,520
-Oslo has a low rate still?
-Still yes.

11
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:38,920
-You had warts in the genitalia or in the rectum area?

12
00:01:39,020 --> 00:02:04,100
-Yes I had once. I think I had once before 73, I mean 76. I'm very bad at years, sorry.

13
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,940
-About 75-76?
-It must be 78.

14
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,090
-You contracted warts?
-Yes.

15
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,670
-And what you did about it? You went to the doctor?

16
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:34,680
-I went to the doctor, it's not in the record. This time it was also in the anus

17
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,680
and it was penicillin or something on.

18
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,760
-And then it disappeared?
-Yes.

19
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:56,850
It was some acid thing, so it just went away very efficient.

20
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,110
It had to be efficient because I was going to Asia the week after, so I remember it very well.

21
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:14,860
So he is HIV positive since many years perhaps.

22
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:22,190
When he had smear 4-5 years ago because already it's 2 years

23
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,930
and they say we took smear 4 years ago, that means 6 years from today,

24
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,770
they found antibodies in the blood.

25
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,020
Therefore it is quite a long time which is going on.

26
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,920
-My homeopath in Oslo she asked me the same question.

27
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:16,520
I said I had warts maybe 10-15 years ago, I had one here and now I noticed it has returned.

28
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:28,020
-After the homeopathic treatment she gave you, you feel better?

29
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:35,670
-In fact I don't feel so bad, I didn't feel bad before. Physically I'm quite well,

30
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:42,170
maybe I'm becoming what you call when you think you have many diseases

31
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,520
because mentally I was stuck.

32
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:53,450
So now I look for symptoms all over and maybe they are false many times.

33
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,100
-The swelling on the glands went away after the medicine?

34
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,520
-They come and go.

35
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:10,780
-For yourself you feel strong, you have enough energy? You don't feel tired?

36
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,100
-Sometimes I feel tired when I feel down.

37
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:32,010
After I've taken the pills she gave me I had 20 hours sleep, so I was wondering that maybe

38
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,840
it was the medicine but after that I had not felt much change,

39
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:44,100
I had felt a sudden itching in the back of my foot.

40
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,360
So which is the symptom that he had described?

41
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,090
Anxiety about health.

42
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,940
He says I have become one of those who think all the time about diseases

43
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,690
and says my psyche is affected and when I feel down, I feel exhausted.

44
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:12,190
-So it was two times that you took antibiotics and one time that you took for the proctitis.

45
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,940
What other time you remember you took antibiotics?

46
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,190
-Penicillin it was.

47
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,190
-When?
-This time we are talking about.

48
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,690
I don't remember but I can not say no.

49
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,340
First of all I have a bad memory, second my parents are dead, I can't ask them

50
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,690
but at least it must be long ago.

51
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:46,840
-Do you have brothers, sisters?
-I have one sister, one brother.

52
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:54,280
-They are also gay?
-No. Not that I know.

53
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,030
-Is it possible that you don't know? They know about you.

54
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,030
You don't keep it secret.
-No.

55
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:24,030
-Can you describe yourself a little bit, can you describe your character?

56
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,680
-It's difficult. I was thinking very hard when I was sitting outside waiting.

57
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,440
I know this is important to be very honest about myself.

58
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:44,500
Today there were three things very abnormal about me. First I woke up early, I never do.

59
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,250
Second I had a big breakfast with eggs and third, I never eat breakfast

60
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:56,140
and third I was in time here, I'm out of time.

61
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:10,090
So first that. That describes me a little. I'm never that late, I'm 10 min late always,

62
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:17,340
I'm always very active, in a hurry when I need to do things and when I don't do things

63
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:25,740
I just sit back and am very apathetic, I can sit for hours like that.

64
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,000
-You like to sit for hours?

65
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:36,070
-I don'n like it but I'm not able to do anything else. I feel very bad if I sit too long,

66
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,180
all the things I should have done?

67
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,820
-What do you do? What is your profession? Your studies?

68
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,170
-I don't have a steady job for more than two years in my life.

69
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:07,820
I suppose it's right to say that I'm a very changeable person, I'm an adventurer,

70
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:15,070
I want to try many things. Last years have been the more steady in my life.

71
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:21,920
Right now I work in a restaurant and in the local radio station.

72
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:33,920
I have been working as a sonalist a part of my life but not very serious,

73
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,930
I don't have the education.

74
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,590
All kinds of job I can get to get money to travel, that's what I have done.

75
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:58,090
-Why you turned to homosexuality? What is your justification for that? What happened?

76
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,490
It was a traumatic experience before or?

77
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:12,240
-No, I was to get married. I had a very good relationship with a girl before but I think homosexuality

78
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:20,200
or bisexuality is something which has been in my body since my birth.

79
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,020
-When did you realize first that you were homosexual?

80
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:39,100
-As soon as I had sexual experiences but of course one tends to think

81
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,870
that the normal thing is to have girls and that's what you do and then suddenly I find out that

82
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,950
they want me to do what you really desire for.

83
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,700
That's reality when I was 24, it's very un normally late, I know.

84
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:02,190
-But before you were able to have a bi-sexual relationship

85
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:08,870
and enjoy a relationship with a woman?
-Oh yes, no problem.

86
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:15,020
-But it was more enjoyable for you to go with homosexual. You are bi-sexual now?

87
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:26,870
-No. I haven't tried that heterosexual for 6-7 years and that was just for fun.

88
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:37,030
-It was for fun to have heterosexual?
-I have no desire for that.

89
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,190
-You lost your parents?

90
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:02,040
-I was 15 when I lost my mother and my father he died four years ago.

91
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:28,930
-Do you have any peculiarities about yourself? Something that you have about your health

92
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:37,540
that seems peculiar? Any fears, any kind of symptoms?

93
00:13:41,780 --> 00:14:01,040
-Phobias. I was afraid of water for years and this was due to the fact that I didn't know how to swim.

94
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,520
I was scared to go into the water because I didn't know to swim.

95
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:18,520
I learned to swim three years ago. So I went to courses. Now I feel more safe about the water,

96
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:24,430
I don't know if I can call it a phobia any longer but of course if I jump into deep waters,

97
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,040
I couldn't do that from a boat. Not still.

98
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:38,180
-Any other fear? Fear of the dark, fear of being alone, fear of being rejected, fear of thunderstorms,

99
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:45,030
fear of animals, any kind of fear or anxiety?
-I have fear of loneliness.

100
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:54,280
-By old age, you are becoming older?
-No, being lonely now.

101
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,050
-So you like company?
-Yes.

102
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,020
-Do you like company all the time or sometimes?

103
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,940
-I think it's OK with loneliness in a room, when I'm alone but to be in a crowd and feel lonely there,

104
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:20,020
it is terrible. To be lonely among many people it is awful.

105
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,270
Like last night I went to the discotheque, I didn't know anyone because I was alone

106
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:31,110
and first of all the noise was very strong and I couldn't talk to anyone if I wanted

107
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:38,360
but not to be able to speak to anyone and the only way of approaching people

108
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:44,860
was of having sex with somebody and I wouldn't mind of course

109
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:53,110
but it made me feel very bad in the crowd. I felt very lonely. This is the fear.

110
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,870
I was very fearful before I left.

111
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:13,620
By describing this way of sexual contact what it portrays? What it shows?

112
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:25,360
Homosexual people, as he said himself, in America for instance they've told me that

113
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,450
there are people who had 1.000 sexual partners the year.

114
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:42,100
It seems that activity in homosexuality is different than activity in heterosexuality.

115
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,860
It's much more intense. When he says I had only 10 partners, he really means

116
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,960
he is not sexual active at all.

117
00:16:55,210 --> 00:17:01,190
What do you believe? If this was a case of Platina for instance, a case of Lachesis,

118
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:11,770
a case of Hyoscyamus, a case of Medorrhinum, a case of Origanum would he say that story?

119
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:19,480
He went to a pub and he felt lonely there, alone within the crowd, he could not establish

120
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,540
contact and therefore he did not want to have sex.

121
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:30,900
Therefore he is somebody who has to establish contact on a deeper level

122
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:41,890
than just the physical contact and in homosexuality we do have that phenomenon.

123
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:51,890
I've talking with an epidemiologist in Berkley and he said he was on the AIDS hospital

124
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:59,150
and they were trying to trace somebody who was AIDS positive and very progressed,

125
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:04,930
they were asking him to try and trace all the people he came in contact with

126
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:11,170
because they wanted to examine all those people and find out what took place.

127
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:20,040
So the answer he had received, the doctor, was what do you mean? How can I know the partners?

128
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:28,130
I know them from the waist downwards, I never saw the face. You see the idea?

129
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:36,780
In homosexuality there is that kind of strong urge for physical sexual contact.

130
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,040
So when he says I went to the pub and I could not establish contact,

131
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:49,780
I had either to establish contact or no sex, that means a person who has to establish contact,

132
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,390
he has to keep the proportions.

133
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,390
-He said he got himself ready to go to Asia...

134
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:19,620
Yes but he said also that he did not have sex in the medical way,

135
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:36,370
that is to transmit the disease which shows also that there was a kind of blockage

136
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,640
towards complete sexual contact.

137
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:48,560
Also he said that he did not have a lot of partners.

138
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,460
If you remember the answer, sex there was something going on. That's the idea.

139
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:07,400
But not this wild sexual activity which we see usually with the male homosexual.

140
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:19,890
Therefore we have to consider that his remedy is not a wild sexual remedy

141
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:28,050
but rather a remedy with some sensitivity that needs contact and romantic element.

142
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,220
Romantic element should be there.

143
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:38,710
-I was very fearful before I left because I knew this would happen.

144
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:44,800
It is the price I have to pay for travelling alone because I travel alone.

145
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:57,120
-That is something that you know about yourself that you always like to be with somebody

146
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,120
or you don't want the same partner all the time, you want to change?

147
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:09,120
-I like to be alone too, as I said, I sit alone and I get apathetic and I don't want anyone

148
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:19,470
to disturb my apathy. I can be there for hours but being with others is terrible to be alone.

149
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:29,730
I don't know if you are interested in astrology but I'm a fish.

150
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:39,470
Everybody tells me that I'm a typical fish, I want to be alone and I don't want to be alone.

151
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,470
It doesn't help you much.

152
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,640
I think it's very hard to answer some of these questions.

153
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,790
-Do you have any fear of heights? Looking from high places?

154
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:14,390
-No. Very high up like on a bridge and looking down, I tend to feel like wanting to jump.

155
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,790
-Always?

156
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:24,050
-Yes, it's very strange the feeling like something is pulling me, wanting to jump.

157
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:32,060
-Do you get depression sometimes?
-Yes.

158
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,260
-What happens then when you are depressed? What are your thoughts?

159
00:22:50,010 --> 00:23:03,480
-When I get depressed I feel that nobody likes me because I'm peculiar, I'm not easy.

160
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:15,370
-In a relationship you have lived with a man together for a period of time and it was difficult?

161
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,040
You found that you were difficult for the other person?

162
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,870
-Yes on the one hand but I always tend to find persons who are difficult themselves,

163
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,210
so it's just been very difficult.

164
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:34,660
-But why you found yourself being difficult, what was the point that you found it is difficult?

165
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:42,300
I'm irritable of I'm very little tolerant? What are the points about yourself?

166
00:23:47,970 --> 00:24:04,310
-I'm a moralist in a sense that I want things to be...it's difficult.

167
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:21,390
-You say whatever you feel. You are a moralist which means?

168
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:32,140
-If people say something to me and if they change their mind after an hour, I get furious.

169
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:43,300
-And if you get furious what you do? You show this anger or you keep it inside?

170
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:50,150
-No I argue. Why you are like this, why you are like that?

171
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,290
-You think you are very impulsive?

172
00:24:54,390 --> 00:25:06,400
-Yes I do speak when I have something on my mind.

173
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:13,050
-Very soon before you even think about it, it comes out?

174
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:26,400
-Yes I suppose so. Especially when I'm annoyed.

175
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:49,790
I have been moralist in my way. If people are not acting or talking what appears

176
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:57,660
to my political view, then I get furious, I'm not easy to be with.

177
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,560
-Do you consider yourself of being fanatical by your political views?

178
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,890
-I don't but I'm sure that others do.

179
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,650
Again the same element.

180
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:31,390
I put certain questions to him, thinking of certain remedies and he comes out with answers

181
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,730
which indicate another remedy.

182
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:42,380
I say do you have any fear of high places, he says not exactly.

183
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,380
I have sometimes when I go to high places, I want to jump. Then I put a question to confirm Aurum,

184
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,810
is he an Aurum case?

185
00:26:51,810 --> 00:27:02,250
And what he says is yes he is depressed but he brings on the morals again,

186
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:06,750
the morality and what he means by his morality. Most probably his morality is quite different

187
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:09,090
than the morality of other people.

188
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:20,060
But he says eventually if somebody is not according to what I believe then I get furious,

189
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:29,810
which shows an extremist again. Either you believe what I say or I get furious.

190
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,960
-An extremist?
-Yes.

191
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,290
-Anarchist, what they call?

192
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:50,230
-I don't call anything but I'm of course what others would say anarchist or socialist.

193
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:58,880
-And you get furious if somebody contradicts you and says you are wrong, it's not like that,

194
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,630
it's like that, then you get furious.

195
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:04,380
-No, it's the other way around. If somebody is saying I think it should be like this

196
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:12,710
and I think that is injustice, I think that's wrong, that' s terrible, then I get furious and I tend to...

197
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:23,300
Even in a little chat in a cafe I get very engaged, instead of talking about the coffee,

198
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:30,050
if somebody says that the coffee it should be very cheap, it is too expensive,

199
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:34,140
then I start to think who is picking this coffee.

200
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,730
And then the whole political thing tends to come up.

201
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:51,960
You see again the same pattern? Who is picking this coffee?

202
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:58,380
The people who are picking this coffee are very poor people and there injustice to them

203
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,130
because who makes the money?

204
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:06,130
Those people who transport the coffee and blah, blah, and then he becomes very engaged to that,

205
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,880
he is very intense. It is an injustice, I'm telling you.

206
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:19,980
This is the idea with that remedy and you will see it again and again and again.

207
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:31,230
What other common symptoms we have seen with the other case?

208
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:37,630
He also is a moralist, he wants to work for...

209
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:45,730
It doesn't matter what he is trying to do, the remedy will be lead to do something for humanity.

210
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:53,210
He may join a political party, he says the others may call me an anarchist or a socialist.

211
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:59,310
I don't call myself an anarchist, I'm right. This is the idea.

212
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:08,320
What I see is right, I see injustice, there is injustice. Of course there is injustice

213
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:14,870
but he ever asked himself whether he is a perfect human being himself?

214
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,970
So why he expects perfection from others?

215
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,980
But this is the point where Causticum can not stand.

216
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:29,220
You made this wrong. This is wrong.

217
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,730
If you tell him this is wrong, he gets very furious.

218
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:45,040
What he sees is injustice and that is the peculiarity of the remedy and that is what

219
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,220
we are interested to see and to find out.

220
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:59,720
It comes out the story, it comes out by itself. You don't even have to question.

221
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:14,620
I see some people are very tired, you need an interval, a coffee break.

222
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:26,160
I want to ask do you see similarities between the first case of Causticum and this case?

223
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:41,170
I see some puzzling faces. Where is the similarity?

224
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:51,960
-Emphasis on injustice.
-They are open minded.

225
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,660
-Intensity.

226
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:13,120
-Within their own sexual sphere they are more conservative than other medicines.

227
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,190
-The desire for company but yet fear of being alone.

228
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,710
Causticum is one of the main remedies fear of being alone, especially in the night.

229
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,040
They want company but at the same time they want to keep on their own.

230
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:45,020
Where Phosphorus definitely wants company all the time.

231
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,270
Causticum want their own time, to be alone as well. Not all the time with company,

232
00:32:51,370 --> 00:33:00,770
not all the time with people. Causticum do not need to hold the hand of somebody all the time.

233
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:06,790
Phosphorus needs to hold somebody, to have company all the time.

234
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:24,440
They are a kind of extremists, not only anarchists, it can not be only but extremists,

235
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:30,540
living in the extremes, going towards the extremes.

236
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:37,440
I dedicated myself completely into this group, this is the idea.

237
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:43,450
They dedicated themselves to the socialist group, this is right

238
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:52,050
and I followed it with all my intensity. I'm telling you this is right. This is the idea.

239
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:06,050
If you recognize these elements, you will be able to recognize the remedies. That's it.

240
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:14,790
It's so difficult, now what he says. He has the sub maxillary gland swollen.

241
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:20,540
And he has anxiety about his health and some fear of death of course.

242
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:25,780
But with these three points you can find the correct remedy?

243
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,020
Never, no matter how much you try. You will never find the remedy

244
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:40,380
but here is a man who is candidate. Maybe we can save him, I don't know yet.

245
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,880
We'll see what happens and it will depend on him also.

246
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:53,880
Whether he will go again and again and get contraction again and get infected again etc.

247
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:05,280
But how can you find his remedy, unless you know the picture. This is my argument.

248
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:09,030
Sometimes you base your prescription only on pathology.

249
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:13,380
Base your prescription on pathology and you have no solution.

250
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:21,880
Give us a little bit more of this information.

251
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,880
-Difficult person to have a relaxed moment with because...

252
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,780
-Your political views are concerning injustice.

253
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,780
What affects you mostly is the element of injustice?

254
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:49,880
-Yes because there is so much, it is enough to pick up and it's going on for years.

255
00:35:52,120 --> 00:36:00,280
-If you see somebody in the street who is suffering with head disease

256
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:07,540
and he is in pain which is not injustice but that will affect you?

257
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:18,550
His pain will affect you or it's only injustice that will affect you?

258
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,300
-I've been to India and I've seen thousands laying on the streets down but what can I do?

259
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,790
It makes me sad but...

260
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:41,290
I went to India with a camera to take pictures but I couldn't' take the pictures.

261
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:52,050
-Why?
-Because I felt like watching.

262
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,490
Why?

263
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:12,130
He saw himself looking upon something with a camera while at the same time

264
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:19,490
the suffering was so obvious, so intense and most probably he must have said, what am I doing?

265
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:25,970
To show pictures about this but now what is happening here is terrible.

266
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:32,820
People are dying from hunger etc. These must have been the thoughts of a Causticum.

267
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:52,320
-It was still even more. Instead, I took pictures of the flowers.

268
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:58,110
I think it's quite hopeless sometimes.

269
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:05,110
Of course it is injustice, I can walk out here and I can point some injustice on the street

270
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,210
but what can I do?

271
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:18,610
Of course I can be criticized for not being politically active, not going into a political party

272
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:25,300
or into organizing demonstrations and things.

273
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,790
-You can be criticized by whom?
-By others who do that.

274
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:50,610
But then I tend to think that my task is like a Christian to go around in my small environment

275
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:58,690
to speak about injustice and to try to change things at my job and

276
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:06,440
the situation there and to do the best kind of work as a sonalist pointing out what is good

277
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:11,210
and what is bad. I try to work in my way.

278
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:27,110
I'm not saying that I'm a just person, of course not. Personally I can be very unjust but I'm

279
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,960
talking about the political view.

280
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:45,360
-Do you like sweets very much?
-Yes I do.

281
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,350
-Very much?
-Maybe.

282
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,960
-More salt or sweets?

283
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:02,200
-It doesn't show but I tend to eat a lot, small eating whether it's potato chips or chocolates,

284
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:13,450
whatever I have I will eat it. I'm not sure but if I go into a shop I buy sweets.

285
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:19,630
If I'm going to have a dinner I like salt and I put too much salt on the meat.

286
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,190
-To all the food you put extra salt?

287
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:32,050
-Yes I work in the kitchen in the restaurant and the others are saying I put too much salt always.

288
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,710
So I suppose so.

289
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:42,460
-What is the main problem now with your health? How you feel it?

290
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,910
-It's my social status.

291
00:40:54,620 --> 00:41:00,310
-You mean because you have been diagnosed that you can not have the contacts

292
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,810
that you would like to have?

293
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:11,030
-No, this is part of the fear of loneliness because now when I'm infected I have to be,

294
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:16,870
my first thought is I can not have sexual life. If you have no sexual life, you have no relationship.

295
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:20,170
Of course I have friends but it's not the same.

296
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:30,290
Now the fear is what the dream of life is to have a sweet heart, someone to love

297
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:37,890
and my first thought was that it was not longer possible.

298
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:46,140
The rest of my life will just be waiting for the decease 1 year, 2 years, 7 years.

299
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:58,890
And I was very afraid to end up in deep depression because I have the talent for depression.

300
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:12,710
So my reaction was to be over active in what I do and what I did to do more work in the radio,

301
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:19,210
to live as actively as possible, meet my friends, go out, have dinners,

302
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:25,710
talk not to be lonely, not to feel this. My fear of loneliness is my biggest problem.

303
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:35,060
When you are depressed I suppose you get less strong, defending myself from other diseases.

304
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,950
This kind of thinking.

305
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:49,040
So I want to stay and try to find this knowledge but I will get sick sooner or later,

306
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,540
at least the school medicine tells me.

307
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,630
-Yes.

308
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,410
-This is mental.

309
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:06,900
-You seem to be sighing frequently. You do this.
-Maybe.

310
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:14,150
-You don't realize it?
-Now? Much?

311
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:22,900
-Now as you talk. Do you like fruits?
-Yes.

312
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:35,250
-You eat a lot? Mostly what you eat?
-Mostly oranges or bananas.

313
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,750
-Other fruits?
-Any fruit.

314
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,650
-What about perspiration? You perspire a lot?
-Yes.

315
00:43:43,750 --> 00:44:04,060
-Where mostly?
-In fact it's been a problem for me through my life.

316
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,650
-Because it smells?

317
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:18,400
-Not that but as soon as I go into do something which is a bit difficult

318
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,900
or asked something for me, I get nervous, this is the way of expressing my nervousness

319
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:34,230
and often I do things that are not part of me, things that I'm not sure that I will manage

320
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,420
but I want to do them anyway.

321
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,660
-How is your sleep now? Do you sleep bad?

322
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:20,310
-Ups and downs too because one of the symptoms as the school medicine says is

323
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:32,310
that you get night sweats  and I did in the beginning but it's like putting all of myself

324
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:36,250
and in the middle of the night I wake up and I'm sweating.

325
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,990
Sometimes I sleep very well.

326
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:52,310
-After the remedy you had been sleeping better than before?

327
00:45:52,410 --> 00:46:01,070
-The weekend after I was a kind of exhausted also because I've been over active before that.

328
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:08,560
So I slept for hours and hours and I slept like dead for 2 days.

329
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,990
-Yes but after that your sleep became better in general

330
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:18,500
or it remained the same pattern as before?
-I think it was the same as before.

331
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:27,010
-You don't want to get up in the morning?
-No, I have this morning fear.

332
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:42,250
-Do you mean that you fear to get up or you fear life because a new day starts?

333
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:57,480
-It's facing the new day and I'm a person who tends to have many tasks for the day

334
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:04,150
which should have been done the day before or the day before. It's the first thought in my mind.

335
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,840
I should have done this.

336
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,740
-And that makes you irritable? It makes you what?

337
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:19,490
-Instead of getting up and do it, it makes me turn and sleep again

338
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:23,100
even though I have no sleep left in my body.

339
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:31,210
I'm able to sleep a little more, I sleep until my headaches is catching me.

340
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:38,530
-Do you physically fight ever when you come into conflict?

341
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:45,120
-Maybe 2-3 times in my life.

342
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,370
-Do you feel there is a lot of anger inside you?

343
00:47:53,360 --> 00:48:03,770
-Not anger, I never feel like physically fighting with someone but I have this kind of anger,

344
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:11,710
which we talked about. About life in general, situations...

345
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:32,120
-Have you ever been near the sea or swimming in the sea or you swim in the lakes?

346
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,850
-I swim in the sea yes.

347
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,600
-Where?

348
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:42,850
-In Oslo but I only swim where I know the bottom is under me.

349
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:51,450
I'm still working on this fear, so my aim is to be able to swim everywhere.

350
00:48:54,700 --> 00:49:00,430
-Have you noticed when you swim in the sea whether it affects your health?

351
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:04,530
That means you feel better or worse to swim in the sea?

352
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:19,950
-I can't answer because it is so few times, when I train swimming I do it in the pool.

353
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:26,610
I went to the courses to learn swimming, it was in the pool.

354
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:35,030
So the swimming in the sea or the lakes has been so few times that I can't answer.

355
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:52,190
But I like the salt in the water, I mean I like to taste or the skin after being...

356
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:59,370
-Yes but you like salt in general, in the food also.

357
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:08,100
-And somehow of course it feels fresher, when I think about it.

358
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:22,200
It's more fresh the water in the sea because there is waves and in small lakes the water is still...

359
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:34,700
Especially in pools it's a lot of chemicals, so I suppose maybe I like the salt water better.

360
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:43,220
-Is any time in the day or night when you feel better or worse?

361
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:56,150
-I feel very well at night, the evening. If I'm going to do something very efficient,

362
00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:02,400
writing or preparing something mental I work best at midnight, after midnight.

363
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,390
Particularly I'm not disturbed, nothing disturbs me.

364
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:18,890
At night there is nothing I could have done. I could have called this person,

365
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:28,690
I could have gone to this office, at night there is no shops to visit, at night there is only me.

366
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:39,310
-But this feeling better starts really after midnight or even before midnight,

367
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:46,660
after the sunset? While the darkness comes you start feeling better?

368
00:51:55,910 --> 00:52:02,100
-Maybe it's more correct to say that I feel better once I have over runned today

369
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,650
and this is after I stopped doing things.

370
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:13,510
From then I feel OK because then I'm active and pushing back these other things.

371
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:34,400
I'm more relaxed after midnight, I'm more able to think clearly, to concentrate.

372
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:44,410
-You never had any urithritis?
-What is this?

373
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:54,730
-It is discharge from the urethra. You know what is the urethra?

374
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:55,760
-No.

375
00:52:55,860 --> 00:53:01,980
-Urinate?
-Yes.

376
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,830
-You had any problems from the urethra?
-Never.

377
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,330
-Do you have another case?

378
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:36,730
Why do I put all these questions? For what remedy?

379
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:37,810
-Medorrhinum.

380
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:43,410
-Medorrhinum very good. Who wants to give Medorrhinum?

381
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:57,310
-Many fears and he spent a long time with Phosphorus but now he has this with injustice

382
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:10,660
and I'm confused, how...[]  It's very strong this injustice.

383
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:25,660
-Did it work Phosphorus? Phosphorus can help? Yes it can.

384
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:32,000
-How strong is the Causticum and Phosphoric?

385
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:42,390
-Here we see another element of Causticum in which he is revolving

386
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:46,740
and it's the element of being left alone.

387
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:56,140
We know that this element is in Causticum and also it is in Phosphorus.

388
00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:04,150
The way he is presenting that element it is not the desire to have company.

389
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:08,650
This is to have company because he is afraid he is going to die

390
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:12,000
and therefore he wants to have some company.

391
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:19,140
Causticum is afraid to die but the company is not to prevent the fear.

392
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:32,000
It is rather for the sake of not feeling in contact. Causticum needs to be in contact at that stage.

393
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:36,010
There is Causticum that progresses very much and paralyses the emotions

394
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:45,620
and he goes into apathy states but at that phase he needs the contact.

395
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:53,860
The idea that he may remain alone is unbearable.

396
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:07,000
Now here we get symptoms of Medorrhinum. For those who know Medorrhinum.

397
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:13,260
And the question is whether you will give Medorrhinum or you will give Causticum

398
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:18,860
and if you have to decide what is the decisive factor in favor of one and not the other?

399
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:29,340
Because we have amelioration in the night which is more prominent for Medorrhinum than

400
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:36,090
Causticum, we have a desire for sweets which is more prominent for Medorrhinum

401
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:44,590
than Causticum, we have desire for salt which is prominent for both,

402
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:55,360
desire for oranges which is in favor of Medorrhinum.

403
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:01,760
Maybe we discover that Causticum has also desire for oranges.

404
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:07,110
We don't know. Don't take these things for absolute.

405
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:13,260
There is only 3 remedies which have desire for oranges, maybe there are 13 remedies

406
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,010
and we don't know them yet.

407
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:21,760
But with what we know we have certain things which are in favor of Medorrhinum

408
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:27,610
and not of Causticum. What is going to be the decisive factor?

409
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,600
-His main complain.

410
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:50,590
-His mental state which is his main complain.

411
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,680
-What is the mental state?

412
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:08,820
You see more injustice, more what we call can not tolerate injustice,

413
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,930
which is in favor of Causticum than Medorrhinum?

414
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:18,430
Medorrhinum is not concerned for injustice but what is the decisive factor?

415
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,170
-Sexual wildness of Medorrhinum.

416
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:30,670
-This is what will hold you back from giving a Medorrhinum in a homosexual case.

417
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:37,330
You will have to have much more physical activity with Medorrhinum; they can not control,

418
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:44,080
the hormonal system is too strong, they can not control it so much as they can Causticums

419
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:48,020
which they need romantic involvement as well.

420
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:58,100
Because if you vacillate between the two remedies, it's going to be a decisive factor.

421
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:25,180
He says that because I will judge him he does not dare to say he has more partners.

422
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:33,170
No, he said himself that he was sitting outside thinking that he should tell me all the truth

423
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,090
in order to help him.

424
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:40,340
This is a desperate case, the man thinks, believes that he is going to die

425
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,330
and he will say it eventually, I'm going to die.

426
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:53,340
He will be ashamed to say I had 50 partners or 200? I asked this same question in

427
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,430
America and he said I'm going steady with my relationship.

428
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,590
I said can you tell me how many?

429
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:14,340
He said I can't tell you how many partners in a year. I said more or less, it's 5, 50 or 200?

430
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:21,680
He says more or less 300 partners a year and this is going steady.

431
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:33,650
He got Medorrhinum, he is going steady that means he was not as promiscuous

432
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,730
as he might have been.

433
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:44,410
You see here they don't have problems to speak out.

434
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:48,650
I don't think we should stick there.

435
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:55,650
When he tries to say a lie which he was not sure, you could see it very clearly.

436
01:00:55,750 --> 01:01:01,730
Then I asked him did you take the antibiotics because you were going...

437
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:08,230
All this laughing, you could see he was going to tell a lie, not exactly a lie

438
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:13,580
but he knew in a deeper level why he was taking the antibiotics.

439
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:20,580
When somebody tells a lie it's obvious.

440
01:01:21,490 --> 01:01:24,160
-Doubt of fear?

441
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:44,410
It's not, he is intense. He said all my talking concerns injustice and I see injustice in everything.

442
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:57,060
When I go out I will see an injustice taking place immediately. He calls that morality.

443
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:06,340
This is his morality. It is a kind of perception of the world under a remedy.

444
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:14,250
That's how they perceive the world.

445
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:25,240
It's another kind of Medorrhinum all together. When we spoke about Medorrhinum

446
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:30,060
yes you are right, we spoke about two types of Medorrhinum.

447
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:37,320
The one who is a monk and the other who is promiscuous; either they will go to be a monk

448
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:49,060
or a promiscuous. Here we don't have the idea of a monk to have the withheld sexual activity

449
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:57,920
which goes onto emotionality and to great intensity in emotionality.

450
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:13,080
Very common?

451
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:27,830
I had 10 people in the video, 10 Norwegians and he is the only one who spoke about injustice.

452
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:31,830
Why the others didn't bring up the subject?

453
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:38,080
And this subject has been brought up also during the first consultation he has.

454
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:46,900
He calls his own morality, he has a specific way for morality, a specific idea of

455
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,990
what is moral and what is immoral.

456
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:58,740
He is an extremist and he says the others call him an anarchist or a socialist.

457
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:06,000
I didn't hear these things from the other Norwegians and I had at least 10 cases on video.

458
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:09,500
Why didn't I hear that from the others?

459
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:19,250
-What about Agnus castus?
-Not at all.

460
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:27,740
-As a secondary remedy would you consider Calcarea phosphorica?

461
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:34,740
-No, I would consider Medorrhinum as a second possibility.

462
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,560
What is the main symptomatology? He has very little physical symptomatology.

463
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:14,400
Except of the glands which are swollen, there is nothing more and perhaps he feels tired

464
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:20,650
from time to time, there is not much physical. What is the mental symptomatology?

465
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:27,650
It's the anxiety. All the time my mind is there I'm going to die. There is an anxiety.

466
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:34,400
There is fear of dying, fear of death and a feeling of loneliness.

467
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:39,150
Why we say the person has a fear of loneliness?

468
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:47,400
If you are able on that respect to establish contacts etc. the fear normally goes away.

469
01:05:54,420 --> 01:06:02,310
When you are sick it doesn't matter whether objectively you are going to die or not.

470
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:05,320
You still may think I'm going to die.

471
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:10,820
Argentum nitricum will think I'm going to die, Aconite will think I'm going to die,

472
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:18,170
in 2-3 months I'm going to die. Never mind whether it is an objective or not situation.

473
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:32,920
Each one projects the way and don't try to classify everybody into the same pattern completely.

474
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:34,570
The ideas are there.

475
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:42,570
One person is born strong, the other is born weak, one person is born in an environment

476
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:47,570
where he was made strong, the other was born in a protective environment

477
01:06:47,670 --> 01:07:03,320
where he was made weak, weak socially, weak professionally. These do not tell about their disease.

478
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:08,660
The disease comes and takes the environment and uses the environment.

479
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:19,190
It says what environment? Very protective. The symptomatology will take such turn.

480
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:25,690
Another one is an environment very aggressive. The disease will take an aggressive turn.

481
01:07:25,790 --> 01:07:30,330
An aggressive Causticum, a very mild Causticum...

482
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:38,670
When it's very mild the Causticum, you will see talking about injustice only.

483
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:42,410
Where somebody else who has lived in a more aggressive environment,

484
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:48,840
the symptomatology will become much more aggressive.

485
01:07:54,330 --> 01:08:02,820
Let us take an individual who is Natrum sulphuricum or who is Dulcamara

486
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:11,810
and this person is born in an environment which is in a nice climate, very good climate,

487
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:19,650
dry, not at all humid he will have some pains.

488
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:26,470
A Dulcamara who lives there, I have some pains here and I have some pains there.

489
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:36,330
Take the same Dulcamara and put him in an environment which is very wet, will say pains!

490
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:48,230
It is the environment which produces the intensity, the challenge in life which you receive,

491
01:08:48,330 --> 01:08:55,340
the stimulations which you receive in life will show the intensity.

492
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:05,010
A Causticum who is born on an environment that was really very unjust,

493
01:09:07,090 --> 01:09:11,090
he will become an anarchist, he will take a bomb and throw it, finished.

494
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,770
There is no limit, it's too much.

495
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:22,170
It doesn't mean that every Causticum takes a bomb; if I gave you that impression it is wrong.

496
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:26,510
It is stages, I talk about stages and stages.

497
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:39,490
A person who is born in an environment in Norway is a very just country.

498
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:46,490
Most of the population are living in a quite high standard, there are no people

499
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:52,660
who are very poor and very rich and there is real injustice like in India

500
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,770
and others undeveloped countries.

501
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:02,760
Living in such an environment you will not have the stimulation for this.

502
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:10,330
Even in the most just system a Causticum will find a way to complain about injustice.

503
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:19,180
That's it. Even the most just that you can imagine, the Causticum will say this is wrong.

504
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:27,580
That is the idea, he may say it in a polite way, I think this is wrong and still it is a  Causticum

505
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:30,680
because the environment is very polite.

506
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:40,150
Like here in Greece very polite, you don't fight, they don't show you real emotions

507
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:46,760
which come from the deepest part, it's very nice, polite.

508
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:51,760
It is the stimulation of the environment, what it does.

509
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:07,510
You don't think I criticize only the other countries, I'm not a chauvinist.

510
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:14,090
I think I see objectively quite a lot, not everything but...

511
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:20,170
That is why I say this is still a case of Causticum.

512
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:29,430
You will tell me in Norway you will not find somebody who is more aggressive than him?

513
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:37,050
Yes but search his environment. And you will find the stimulation which is much stronger.

514
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:43,650
How the symptoms appear? Through stimulation only.

515
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:54,490
You get a Stramonium child. The stimulation is important, how much, what kind etc.

516
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:38,660
I usually do not theorize. Of course if I see somebody is telling me lies,

517
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:45,010
I will say he is telling lies but I do not see this man telling lies apart from one point.

518
01:12:46,250 --> 01:12:51,410
All the other things he said I accept. I do not see reasons why?

519
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:56,750
Can you tell me what he is doing now?

520
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:04,250
First of all if somebody is telling a lie, shall I tell you what he does?

521
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:19,650
He will not look at you. If he says a lie, he is going to say the most sophisticated lie,

522
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:32,090
it's going to be like that, no I don't think so. This you can trust.

523
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:37,840
But if he looks in your eyes and says no I don't think so...

524
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:50,090
Tricks like that and you understand. Otherwise you doubt anything, you theorize anything under the air.

525
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:56,740
Anything can be said and can be theorized and it is the opposite of what he said.

526
01:13:56,840 --> 01:13:59,670
Where do you end with that?

527
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:08,160
-Yesterday you said people Causticum desire sweets.

528
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:14,180
-No, this I don't consider desire for sweets, it is normal.

529
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:22,070
It doesn't go over the normal to consider it as a desire.

530
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:27,340
What I consider desire for sweets is really what he talks about salt.

531
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:32,400
Then there is real desire for sweets.

532
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:38,900
There are some Causticum that will tell you desire for sweets and they mention it strongly,

533
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,750
even more than salt, then I consider it as a desire.

534
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:52,330
In this case I will write it down perhaps but not even one underline.

535
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:10,090
Yes of course. Of course there is a follow up. There are several follow ups of one year.

536
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:20,160
So you will see what happens in one year, he is still alive once we have the follow up.

537
01:15:24,170 --> 01:15:30,580
Causticum 1M. In the next interview you will hear it.

538
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:42,840
Don't expect me to remember anything. This was a case one year ago.

539
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:15,590
-We discussed this case with your practitioner, I advised her

540
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:34,490
but I feel that you should be checking yourself more regularly if you take that treatment,

541
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:41,590
it should be a kind of check-up to see whether there is any changes.

542
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:50,910
-You mean to see the changes in the blood?

543
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:58,090
-Yes to see if there is any real change objectively.

544
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:10,820
It is the end of the tape.

545
01:17:46,570 --> 01:17:58,080
Why do you think that she got up and said can you open the window?

546
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:01,080
And why did she go to open the window?

547
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:11,140
These things if you don't take into consideration, what are you going to take?

548
01:18:12,410 --> 01:18:20,240
She was bothered the most and some others also did bother but they did not get up.

549
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:33,320
She was bothered the most and at the same time she did not have much timidity.

550
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:43,990
So you find a remedy which is sociable and is bothered by heat.

551
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:49,220
We have two symptoms already for her.

552
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:52,980
So when she comes to me and says I have that symptom, I say take that remedy

553
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:54,820
because I have observed that.

554
01:18:55,570 --> 01:18:59,830
I have observed the other one who is also there with the blue, she is also suffering.

555
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:08,070
True?
-Very much.

556
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:11,320
-How much?

557
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:22,470
That is another type, do you see how difficult it was for her to say it to the class?

558
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:39,310
It's not the same yes. That means she is another type who is suffering from the heat

559
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:42,160
but she is closed up.

560
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:55,160
This is what I want you to develop, power of observation and don't make stories.

561
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:11,580
She is suffering, she doesn't talk whether the other one extrovert, got up and opened the window.

562
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:17,410
Another remedy.

563
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:27,050
-There was another story after the interview. He was very angry about the interview.

564
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:36,810
-Why?

565
01:20:36,910 --> 01:20:47,650
-I wanted to show you the point where he feels that he has not completed the interview.

566
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:54,650
He was very angry, he didn't want to take the remedy, he was not happy with the interview

567
01:20:54,750 --> 01:21:02,150
because most probably he was not allowed to say everything that he wanted to say

568
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:08,490
and he had a strong reaction. Maybe he will say that, now we will see.

569
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:28,720
-Not made a complete report yet because there is no reason for making any report on this level.

570
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:32,070
There is no result.

571
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:50,080
I have just given a short report about the general, what you asked about and that's it.

572
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:15,440
-OK great. I saw you last time in London, when it was? When did you take the medicine?

573
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:25,930
-I don't remember exactly, it was the first days in June.
