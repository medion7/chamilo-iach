1
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,790
-Number 6 case is a case of...who knows the remedy?

2
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,980
The others you don't know the remedy?

3
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,600
Who would prescribe Aconitum in that case?

4
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,440
That majority. So we have to comply with that.

5
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,700
Here she has some symptoms.

6
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,930
Fear that somebody was behind her. Do we have that under Aconite?

7
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,810
-No.

8
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:36,590
-Fear that somebody will break into her house. How you will look on that?

9
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,790
Fear of robbers.

10
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,360
-Do you have Aconite there?
-No.

11
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,110
-Anxiety about others? Do you have Aconite?
-Yes.

12
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,920
-Worse with heat, she likes to walk in the rain.

13
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,890
She came to consult until September after labor where she started having phobias,

14
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,750
fear of something bad was going to happen.

15
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,820
The way things are underlined is not very clear that it's Aconite

16
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,270
but once you put things together in that case and especially after the lecture,

17
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:43,330
you can see the Aconite picture.

18
00:02:49,830 --> 00:03:02,450
Yet there are things in her case that would one think it's not a typical Aconite.

19
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:11,450
From that case, I don't know if you are able to see, that it is not a very typical Aconite.

20
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:20,940
If you see the phobias before, so we see an Aconite constitution, as we call it.

21
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:28,930
But we see a phobia imprinted after labor that maybe she will be dying during labor

22
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,190
and the phobias appeared.

23
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:44,120
Also the case shows underneath that there is perhaps another remedy before Aconite.

24
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:54,090
And though we expect perhaps that Aconite will not finish this case

25
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,190
and maybe another remedy will be needed eventually.

26
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,850
What would be the underlined remedy?

27
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,190
I will read you the follow up.

28
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,350
50M.

29
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:51,360
She came after almost a month and the doctor has written better, underlined 3 times.

30
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,110
This is not a good thing to write.

31
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,560
The best thing to write is to have the exact impact and the impression in the paper case,

32
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,260
if you want the case to be studied by somebody else,

33
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,500
the best thing is to write exactly the words of the patient. Oh, I'm the same, oh, I'm the same.

34
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:30,520
Oh, I think I've been better. It makes a big difference. Fantastic!

35
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:44,520
If we have that indicated, we know actually by this explanation, how this case has acted.

36
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,160
And this is very important for us, we have to know it.

37
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,650
So better, underlined 3 times, it doesn't mean anything.

38
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,510
And I have told you many times, don't write that. Write the exact words of the patient.

39
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:17,510
From the first day what she says almost I felt better. The dullness in the head went away.

40
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,160
The last few days the flushes turned 2-3 times but without the dullness.

41
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:30,900
Psychologically I'm better, I'm not bothered by relatives coming to the house.

42
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,160
In that case relatives were coming to the house and she was feeling claustrophobic

43
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:44,400
and she would go away. She is not bothered now. The fear of death is better.

44
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,660
I do not cry but neither I have the constriction in the throat.

45
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:59,480
Irritability is better, I have more patience, I'm not so angry with the children.

46
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:07,620
Perhaps I don't sympathize so much anymore, she says, with things which happen to the others.

47
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:15,710
She is not in a hurry. Sleep is good, no position, no nightmares.

48
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:23,480
Fear for her kids underlined 3 times, she likes the rain, good appetite, nausea is better,

49
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:36,320
desire fish once, desire fat once, desire oranges twice, thirst twice.

50
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:49,820
The menses came 7 days earlier, she was irritable and she had a headache before menses.

51
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,430
Lately I feel a bad taste in my mouth and my husband complains

52
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,290
that my mouth is smelling badly.

53
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:24,180
So she comes about 10-11 months late after that interview and she says

54
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:33,670
I have started having flushes of heat in the face again,

55
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,020
the dullness in the head is not as before.

56
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,870
I have much mucus coming from the throat.

57
00:08:51,860 --> 00:09:00,690
She says I'm not afraid anymore staying alone, actually I want to stay alone.

58
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:13,700
When I'm in grief, I have a constriction in the throat but I do not cry.

59
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:23,340
She is now quite irritable underlined 3 times and she shows that irritability.

60
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,680
Sighing underlined once and she is worse consolation underlined twice.

61
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,000
There is some anxiety about health and anxiety about others

62
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,610
but not as much as before the anxiety.

63
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,270
Very little anxiety when others come to my house, not in a hurry.

64
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,770
Sleeps in no position.

65
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:26,220
Desires milk, thirsty underlined once and she says that the last month she had twice menses.

66
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:41,130
The last 2-3 month she had twice menses and the menses lasted 3-4 days.

67
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,630
Great irritability before menses she says again.

68
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:57,540
Perspiration mostly on palm she says, offensive odor from the mouth,

69
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,130
and the last 4 months she has come up with some acne.

70
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:20,520
The doctor does not say why but a month ago she took some antibiotics for a week

71
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,630
but she does not say why.

72
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:38,970
Now what are you going to do?

73
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:53,530
Hormonal levels in her body must have been disturbed because of the acne

74
00:11:53,630 --> 00:12:01,130
and the hormonal changes. So something is going on with the hormones.

75
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:18,410
Is this suffering the same as the first? She is on another level all together.

76
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,310
The problem is, can we help her further?

77
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,300
Other idea?

78
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:05,300
Who would see Nat mur in that case? Who would see Ignatia?

79
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:13,890
Who would see Sepia? Who would see Aconite again?

80
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:22,390
It was given, not by me, by another doctor in the Center, Natrum muriaticum 200.

81
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:47,380
And she comes 7 months later to say that she was doing very well

82
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,790
but she has family problems.

83
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:09,940
She has problems with her brothers and sisters that they want to take away

84
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,790
from her property or something like that.

85
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:30,200
She has a lot of irritability, sighing she says, she has developed fear of accident,

86
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,940
she is afraid to travel that maybe she will have an accident

87
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:42,040
and she cannot tolerate closed places, fear of accidents underlined 3 times.

88
00:14:43,280 --> 00:15:04,570
I feel bitterness and ranged from the behavior of my brother, I have flushes of heat,

89
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,660
dullness in the head and confusion.

90
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:26,920
I have constriction in the throat and sighing, she does not want consolation, not in a hurry.

91
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:40,650
She has changed her house to another location where she does not have any more these relatives

92
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,080
coming so much in her house. So she cannot tell about that.

93
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:52,840
2-3 times the last 6 months she had severe headaches in the whole head.

94
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,230
When she has the headache, she has to remain immovable,

95
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,500
otherwise the least movement makes her worse.

96
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:26,750
She is worse jarring 3 times, the headache is better with vomiting, desire sweets twice.

97
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,990
The doctor has not counteracted the therapy by drugs.

98
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,250
Here what are you going to do?

99
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:19,730
She is very much irritable underlined 3 times, shouts, she has again the dullness in the head

100
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:25,440
with the flushes of heat, she has great fear of accidents,

101
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:32,410
she is afraid to travel and she cannot tolerate closed places.

102
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:48,000
She had 3 big crisis of headache, this is the symptomatology for which she is coming.

103
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,650
The flushes, the heat, the headache, the dullness in the head,

104
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,240
she has developed the fear of accidents and closed places.

105
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:16,970
You have to evaluate our previous prescription and what is happening.

106
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,560
What is happening at the moment with the patient?

107
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:46,090
She was under stress quite a lot because of her brothers who wanted to take her property

108
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:57,190
by some hereditary trick...Things like that are very stressful.

109
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:08,540
You cannot say in a case like that, when they say I have been well

110
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,970
and later on I have relapsed, you cannot say that.

111
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:22,620
Because what the patient says I'm very well and is under stress, it is a kind of relapse.

112
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Not total perhaps but a kind of relapse.

113
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,630
She says I was doing very well .

114
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,450
What is interesting here?

115
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,020
Fear of accident is a symptom of Aconite.

116
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:21,250
Because causative factor is different, what we are mostly concerned is about the picture,

117
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:24,930
of the new picture that we have now.

118
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:32,120
What remedy covers that new picture most complete?

119
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:43,250
We have certain symptomatology of the past coming back, the dullness, the flushings,

120
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:58,010
the dullness of the head and also we have the claustrophobia.

121
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,730
The claustrophobia was there and the dullness in the head was there

122
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,980
and the flushing was there.

123
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,650
Now we have the appearance of a new symptom. The fear of action.

124
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,900
Did we have it in the beginning?
-No.

125
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:28,750
-So we have the appearance of a new symptom, which is one of characteristics of Aconite.

126
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:38,070
So we have a kind of relapse with a new symptom, which again points to Aconite,

127
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:45,670
in spite of the fact that the causative factor is now different.

128
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:53,570
The picture that is developing is again Aconite definitely because of this new symptom

129
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,420
which is confirmed.

130
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:09,810
For me what we're thinking is right, yes Aconite because we have that new symptom

131
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:18,900
which confirmed. What I'm interested is why this is happening?

132
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,510
We have given Aconite and she did very well.

133
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:32,150
Then we gave Nat mur, she did well and then she relapsed into a state of Aconite,

134
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,740
not into a state of Nat mur. This is my question.

135
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:45,640
I would ask myself in case I had left this case without Nat mur,

136
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,080
would have been perhaps the same?

137
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,730
Because Nat mur is a deeper remedy. That means we gave Aconite, it acted.

138
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:04,190
It took away one layer. Then we gave Nat mur it has acted. It took away one layer.

139
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:10,520
Then the most natural thing, when we have a relapse, is to come back to the Nat mur state.

140
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:19,650
If Nat mur was the underlined remedy really, it should have come back as Nat mur state,

141
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:25,740
not as Aconite state. If it had acted.

142
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,410
That is one of the reason why I say Nat mur,

143
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:49,260
either was indicated very superficial or not at all in that time in history for that person.

144
00:24:52,500 --> 00:25:05,050
Could we have said that because of some grief it was an imprinted picture of Nat mur?

145
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:09,050
We could have said. So Nat mur is a deeper remedy

146
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,970
and we have to be careful how we prescribe it.

147
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:22,210
Here I don't believe that this is the case. Maybe it was some grief? No.

148
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:32,970
Most probably I reason out that Nat mur did nothing, the case would have continue to go

149
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:38,390
well and then under stress, relapsed into a state of Aconite.

150
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:49,390
My reason is that Nat mur at that moment that it was given did nothing, did not disrupt the case

151
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:59,230
and when she was under stress, we had back the Aconite state.

152
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:23,470
Aconite 50M was given again and she remained well for a year almost.

153
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:52,220
Eventually Ignatia was given to that person on '82.

154
00:26:53,730 --> 00:27:05,890
It was good result and it was repeated again Ignatia in 1983 and in the beginning of 1983

155
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:12,130
it was repeated Ignatia and she has not come back since that time.

156
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:21,380
That means it was an Aconite, relapsed to Aconite state, then grief, Ignatia,

157
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:28,630
imprinted state of Ignatia, Ignatia was given, again more grief, again Ignatia it was imprinted,

158
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,890
then we give Ignatia and she continues in a good state.

159
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:39,130
Still we do not have the under Aconite. I believe that under Aconite,

160
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,230
it might have been Sulphur.

161
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:50,880
But still we have to see when she comes back perhaps after 2-3 years that we may be able

162
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:56,970
to assess Sulphur and we give it and then we make that person progress more.
