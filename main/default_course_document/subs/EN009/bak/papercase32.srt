1
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:28,810
The case I'm going to show to you is a classic case of the last strategy

2
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,860
where you have to take the essentials of a case.

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,770
Where we don't have mental-emotional symptoms and we have only gross pathology

4
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:45,760
and then we have to find which is the remedy

5
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:50,350
which combines the gross pathology of that case.

6
00:00:51,680 --> 00:01:01,270
I believe that almost nobody has seen the case, maybe a few have seen it.

7
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:10,670
The case is here to give a follow up and after we have analyzed the case,

8
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,110
you are going to see the follow up.

9
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,500
-The report here says that this patient has a neprhotic syndrome

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,260
called by minimal change glomerulonephritis.

11
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:40,380
He also has an autonomous nephropathy with tendency to orthostatic hypotension.

12
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:51,940
He has been using steroids as well as cyclosporine and in periods cyclophamide.

13
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,940
He is now in remission and he has no symptom and uses no medication.

14
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:08,200
His latest blood test are included in separate copy and this was done on April 96.

15
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,240
There is some more information.

16
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,280
I was bleeding from the rectum and colon. It was quite steady.

17
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,290
It started about 10 years ago.

18
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:42,880
I came from the States after a Tour and when I came home it started with hemorrhagic colitis.

19
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:51,880
I was hospitalized, I thought I had some kind of virus, I didn't know what happened.

20
00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:03,530
The bleeding was stopped and it changed to the kidney filter.

21
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:12,030
They found out that I got this loss of albumin very heavy, just the albumin.

22
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:18,790
All the other things were in tact.

23
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:28,040
At that time when I go home it started also the pupillary dysthony,

24
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:36,700
I was reacting very much to light. One pupil was much bigger than the other one.

25
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:49,540
Then I started to get edema, swelling, my albumin went down and I gained very much weight.

26
00:03:49,640 --> 00:04:00,950
In 10 days about 30 kilos. I didn't get my urine out.

27
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:12,210
I tried several things to stop it and finally they had to give me sent poison.

28
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:28,800
A special poison they use for cancer patients. It's called sentoxan.

29
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:42,150
They may use it for cancer cases and they had to use heavy dose to stop it.

30
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:53,290
When they stopped it, I lost 32 kilos in 16 days.

31
00:04:53,390 --> 00:05:00,630
The last weekend from Friday to Monday I lost 16 kilos just in water.

32
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:08,720
-Which had been retained from the body?
-Yes. I just got out the urine in buckets.

33
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:18,400
Of course at the time before I went to the States, I was pretty warn out,

34
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:28,820
I had a chiropractor myself, I had a private clinic in Oslo, a big practice.

35
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:36,340
I had several people working for me and my immune system was low at the time

36
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,360
I was in the States.

37
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,340
-Why? What happened in the States?

38
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,650
-I'm playing in a music band in Norway and we had a Tour there

39
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:57,400
and of course I was eating in some of these coffee shops and restaurants.

40
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:06,150
I thought maybe I got something in a fruit and because I didn't have any symptoms at all before.

41
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:14,070
-Did you take any antibiotics before because you had some kind of flu or bronchitis

42
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:22,420
or anything like  and you took some antibiotics before the colon started bleeding?

43
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,170
-No.

44
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,400
-Did you have any urinary infection?

45
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:41,650
-The only thing I can remember is that I was urinating a little more frequent than I usually do.

46
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,140
That's the only thing I can remember.

47
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,250
I checked my prostate but I did not find anything. My prostate was OK.

48
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:01,330
-But you did not take any antibiotics because of this frequent urination?

49
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:09,820
-No, I didn't do that. I'm a chiropractor myself and I'm against to the antibiotics

50
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:22,160
and my way of treating that thing, I would try to stimulate the nerve impulse to urine bladder.

51
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:31,080
I know when I studied in the States, I was interning with doctor [name]

52
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:37,060
who was supposed to be the best in my profession and he treated me once for that,

53
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:50,080
correcting the third lumbar in the spine and that took care of my frequent urination

54
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,270
at that time because I've had that before.

55
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:01,230
-So first you had frequent urination, then you went to America,

56
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:08,340
then you had ulcerative colitis that started with bleeding.

57
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:26,740
-I came home to Norway and I had diarrhea and I could see a little bit on my stool.

58
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,990
-So you had diarrhea not in the United States but on the airplane.

59
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,730
-Just when I went home it started.

60
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,570
-The first day?

61
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:39,060
-Yes it started a little bit in the plane but then it continued.

62
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,570
-And they you had what treatment for this?

63
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:53,310
-I was checked in a hospital and I took colonoscopy and they found out

64
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:59,570
that I had hemorrhagic colitis and then they thought that I might have

65
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:08,060
what they call Cronh' s syndrome or ulcerative colitis but they were not sure about it.

66
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,430
It was a slight bleeding.

67
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:20,740
That particular time too I was very sensitive for the fruits I was eating.

68
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:27,090
-I'm interested about the medication that you took at that time.

69
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,730
-First of all they didn't want to give me any medication, they were trying to observe me

70
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:46,240
in the hospital and then they tried to give me some cortisone.

71
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,550
-Cortisone enemas?

72
00:09:47,650 --> 00:10:07,650
-Yes but still the heavy albumin loss started very slight and then it was like an explosion.

73
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:18,000
They had to increase the dose on the cortisone with not very much effect.

74
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:29,990
Finally they had to go to this sentoxan poison, they used it intravenously.

75
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:35,500
That stopped the albumin.

76
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,820
-Without side effects?

77
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:50,080
-The side effects I got from cortisone because I had to use very high dose

78
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:55,930
and it affected my mental stage, it is a stress hormone.

79
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,090
-How it affected?

80
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,820
-I felt a little aggressive, I felt that I had very much energy

81
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:20,820
that I could solve many problems at the same time. That's the main thing.

82
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,330
I was against and I have always been against any kind of medication

83
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:32,910
because of my background but I said that if I was going to take any medication,

84
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:42,820
I was going to take it for a short period and then to take the fire and then get it away

85
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,670
and they agreed to that.

86
00:11:48,680 --> 00:12:00,880
What happened then, they stopped the albumin, I took a biopsy of the left kidney.

87
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,750
In fact they asked me which kidney they should take a biopsy

88
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:12,000
and one week before I went to a homeopath in Sweden.

89
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:23,720
He was looking in my eyes and he said there is something wrong with your left kidney.

90
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,990
So when they asked me in the hospital, I said left.

91
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,900
I asked the surgeon what he found in the biopsy and he said

92
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:41,800
that it was a very slight inflammation, not really much notable.

93
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,470
-When this biopsy was?

94
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:56,550
-About a month or three months after, this was 10 years ago.

95
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:08,300
I was against for the biopsy too because I know so many cases, I was afraid of bleeding,

96
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:15,650
there is a lot of side effects. So I had to be sure to get the best surgeon to do it.

97
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:34,160
So he did it and the conclusion was that I got nephrotic syndrome.

98
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:49,060
They thought maybe it could be some vegetable disturbance,

99
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:56,050
something wrong with the autonomous nervous system and that was interesting thing.

100
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:02,810
They sent me to one specialist, they tested the sympathetic and the parasympathetic

101
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:10,640
with all kinds of stimuli and what they found out was very special.

102
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:17,320
On the graph it was just one line. It was any kind of stimulation.

103
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,800
It didn't show anything and that was very special.

104
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,700
-How did they explain this?
-They couldn't explain it.

105
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,300
They thought it is very strange, the one who did the examination

106
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,390
never saw something like that before.

107
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:46,780
So they thought it was with any kind of stimulation it was not through the cord

108
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,980
but directly to the brain, but they couldn't explain it.

109
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:58,780
-Did you feel the pinch?
-Yes I feel the pinch.

110
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,790
-Immediately after they put the needle, you feel the pinch?

111
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:10,490
-In fact I'm very pain sensitive and of course all the blood tests I did

112
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:27,590
and different kinds of stimulations and both were no reaction at all.

113
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:38,490
Of course after that I noticed a lot of things, we did some tests,

114
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,340
my hemoglobin starts to go down.

115
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,670
I just want to make some remarks at that point. I hope you follow the case.

116
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:05,410
I want to make a remark concerning a no reaction from the neurovegetative system.

117
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:15,650
You remember I put a question immediately to him, when they pinch do you feel the pain?

118
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:26,810
Why did I say that? Because I was thinking of Opium, Cocculus and remedies

119
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:33,720
which do not give out pain, do not give out signals.

120
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:45,460
We have to have a remedy that really has this insensitivity or a lower activity.

121
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:58,140
He says no I'm sensitive to pain, so I get exactly the opposite answer than what I expect.

122
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,630
My mind says now most probably you are on the wrong direction.

123
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,430
Let's continue, find out what happens.

124
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:19,960
So far the description is for me to understand this, why the kidneys have broken down?

125
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:26,190
There is a lot of albumin, there is a nephritic syndrome, developing out of the blue.

126
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:36,180
How is that? He relates this ulcerative colitis and then the cortisone.

127
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:43,600
Is it possible that the cortisone itself has broken down the kidneys? Maybe.

128
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:52,520
What I'm driving at is the idea of having antibiotics which we know many times affect

129
00:17:52,620 --> 00:18:08,180
the kidneys, break down the kidneys and the idea of having a urinary infection like urithritis,

130
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:16,190
gonorrhea, non-specific urithritis, taking antibiotics and then the kidneys are breaking down.

131
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:29,850
I'm trying to find out whether this is case of a deeper infection from the genitourinary system,

132
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,020
the infection goes into the kidneys and then we have this result.

133
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:41,840
It seems in his case it is not. It is rather genetic weakness of the kidneys,

134
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,790
which are breaking down under the pressure from cortisone.

135
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,100
-The percentages have been very high but now it starts to get down

136
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,680
and I go this orthostatic blood pressure.

137
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:12,440
In fact the orthostatic went very low, down to 60 over 40 and sometimes I had problem,

138
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,450
I was fainting.

139
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,100
-Fainting when arising from bed or from seat?

140
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:37,350
-Both the bed and seat. It felt like I'm losing the blood in my stomach

141
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:54,690
and I started to get used to it. But now at this time my blood pressure is about 80 over 50.

142
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,260
That's when I'm sitting. When I'm standing up and you take the blood pressure the other way,

143
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,500
it goes down, so it could be down to 60 over 40.

144
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,110
-Even now?
-Yes.

145
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:20,350
It's a very big change from sitting to standing and from standing to sitting.

146
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:36,840
Another thing I would say is that the last years I have had that problem

147
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:44,330
that I had to use my abdominal muscles to empty my urinary bladder.

148
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:51,090
I can urinate but I usually sit when I urinate because if...

149
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,100
-Urination is better by sitting?

150
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:00,090
-Yes because if I'm going to empty it all, I had to sit.

151
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,090
-Do you have to lean back also?

152
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:10,580
-Yes I really have to contract my abdominal muscles to empty, I can urinate

153
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:17,270
but to empty it I have to really press.

154
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:47,430
This is a symptom you look in your Repertory. Did you find it? Urination better sitting?

155
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:05,850
-Bladder urination retarded, must wait for urine to start, sitting only partial urine can.

156
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:14,110
-What is the remedy?
-Causticum and Zincum.

157
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:23,100
-So you search a peculiar symptom like that, you see only two remedies.

158
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:30,250
-There is another rubric, bladder urination dripling, sitting ameliorates.

159
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:36,330
-What is the remedy?
-Only Causticum.

160
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:43,160
-Another rubric. It is called urination retarded, must press with his abdominal muscles.

161
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:50,930
-What is the remedy?
-Magnesium phosphorica.

162
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:04,920
-Another rubric. Urination retarded, must sit to press, then only a few drops come out.

163
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,510
Abies nigra.

164
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,260
-Retarded due to spasm of the sphincter.

165
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,850
-What is this last symptom? Read the symptom.

166
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:52,090
-Urination retarded on account of spasm of the sphincter.

167
00:23:53,100 --> 00:24:00,250
-Urination, can only urinate when sitting was Zincum and urination go backwards also Zincum,

168
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,200
if I understood correctly.

169
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,840
In the same raw we also have the rubric urination, can only urinate when sitting bend forward.

170
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,180
Sulphur is also containing this remedy.

171
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:30,840
-So this is the search you have to do in case you hear a peculiar symptom.

172
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:39,430
Peculiar symptom is why? Because we have only a few remedies producing such symptom.

173
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:52,450
So this is what we call a keynote. So far what we have is some pathology and one keynote.

174
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:05,090
And these are the remedies we may be thinking, Causticum, Zincum...

175
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:27,690
-To the stress because I have been very hard many many years and I had a really high load.

176
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:36,070
Of course now I'm fortunate to take just special cases myself,

177
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:45,310
I have other people working for me and I can concentrate on special cases

178
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:51,620
and take the time, I don't have any stressful situation with that.

179
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:06,090
I went through a divorce, that was about 15 years ago.

180
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:15,250
I was married about 15 years ago and I divorced.

181
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:22,480
But it went out OK, we are very good friends all the time.

182
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,840
It's no problem in connection with that.

183
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:38,500
-How old are you now?
-I'm 49 today, it's my birthday.

184
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:54,320
So I thought it will change my new life. Of course I don't know if you want me

185
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,820
to continue to explain or if you want me to ask questions

186
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,930
but I've been through a lot of different kinds of treatments.

187
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:18,070
I take Acupuncture, one of the best acupuncturists in China. He is working in my clinic,

188
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,570
a couple of times the year.

189
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:25,490
His name is Dr Sein He is writing a lot of books for Acupuncture

190
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,090
and he has been treating me with no effect.

191
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:39,260
He also took some herbs from China which didn't have any effect

192
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:49,820
and I had several other other kinds...

193
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:57,580
I don't have the names of all different types I had but it hasn't been an effect.

194
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:11,670
Lately I also went to a German who made a special ceremony for my own blood.

195
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:23,650
He is located in [place name]  in Germany and I was supposed to take these drops he made

196
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:30,400
and also intravenous, I should take it for about a year, I have taken it for 8 months

197
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:41,340
but no effect. Still this causes pretty frequent albumin.

198
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:49,320
The thing which had some effect on albumin to keep it stable was a special herb

199
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:56,680
from up the mountains, it is called cyclosporine, it's a special herb poison.

200
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,410
I don't know if you are familiar with it.

201
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:09,150
It is a special herb which come from North in the mountains in Norway

202
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:18,160
and they found out that that had effect to keep it but as soon as they stop it,

203
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,840
it comes back again.

204
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,930
I stopped that because you see what I did. I started with this herb

205
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:40,330
and I had to take higher and higher doses of it and didn't have an effect anymore.

206
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:54,580
Now I don't take it, I'm the moment I'm protein free, no albumin and I'm free of medication.

207
00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:09,080
At that time the problem is that I know from experience that I get a relapse after some time

208
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:17,910
if I don't do something and I have very good belief in you and Homeopathy is a solution,

209
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,670
if you are able to find...

210
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:26,410
-Have you taken already homeopathic remedies?
-It's a long time ago.

211
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,510
-What remedies?

212
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:42,410
-I don't remember what kind of remedies, the name of it. I tried several combinations.

213
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:50,660
-Who has the names? Nobody. You took combination remedies, mixtures?

214
00:30:50,760 --> 00:31:06,810
-I tried both. I got that from a Swedish homeopath, mixtures and the other,

215
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:13,410
the direct without any mix, the clean ones.

216
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,660
I was just thinking if it's anything else I should tell you.

217
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:39,060
In the hospital they don't think the stress situation has anything to do with it.

218
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:45,910
Of course they don't have any idea of all that.

219
00:31:52,160 --> 00:32:03,920
But later on if it is interesting for you I can find out what remedies and I can fax it to you.

220
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:13,420
-After the chemotherapy you took homeopathic remedies?

221
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:34,170
-I stopped the medication for the chemotherapy and I never did combine the two.

222
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,400
I always stopped the one thing and then tried the other.

223
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:43,480
-Yes, you tried Acupuncture, you tried herbs and you tried Homeopathy after.

224
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:49,480
The medicines that you took from Homeopathy after that, what were? Do you remember?

225
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,650
-The name of it?
-Yes.

226
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,810
-That's what I was trying to think.

227
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:00,240
-They were mixtures?
-Mixtures yes.

228
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:09,990
-And this mixture was especially for kidneys?
-Yes.

229
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,590
-How do you know that there was no effect?

230
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:31,470
-The only thing I can say is that I see that I was getting edema again,

231
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:38,310
I check my urine very regularly.

232
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:45,410
I have a stick which I test it and I see if it's any slight proteinuria.

233
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:56,060
I know when it starts a little bit with the proteinuria then it's very difficult to stop it.

234
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,180
It is just like an explosion.

235
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,760
-Are you careful with your diet?

236
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:15,230
-Yes I'm careful with my diet. I don't eat red meat at all. I try to eat more vegetarian,

237
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:22,590
fibers and eat a lot of water and I don't drink alcohol.

238
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:31,830
The only meat I eat is white meat, like turkey and chicken.

239
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,250
Of course I might be a little heavy in eating eggs.

240
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:47,640
I like to eat eggs in the morning to get that metabolism. I exercise much.

241
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:55,540
In the clinic I have a big Clinic Center, so every day as a routine

242
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,390
I go through an exercise program.

243
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:15,300
Then I try to compensate the catabolic effect with the exercise.

244
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,400
-Let me say a few things to the class now.

245
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:27,800
I left this gentleman to talk because of a severe condition, as you understand.

246
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:36,710
We have liked to know what is going on as far as pathology is concerned.

247
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:45,810
What is not clear for me is how the kidneys were affected.

248
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:52,710
In order to have such an effect on the kidneys, we have to have either

249
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:59,210
a hereditary predisposition or we have to have some previous disease,

250
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:04,710
which had a repercussion or an effect on the kidneys.

251
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:11,290
Such diseases are venereal diseases like gonorrhea, urithritis and things like that

252
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:18,310
or we investigate the possibility of his hereditary condition.

253
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:25,470
We would like to know how parents are alive, what they are suffering from,

254
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:31,970
especially the father, whether the father had kidney stones,

255
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:38,220
in order to understand how the kidneys were so easily affected.

256
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,960
Because it seems that there is a predisposition, a weakness on the kidneys

257
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:50,970
and why this weakness has been triggered. Can you tell us anything about this?

258
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:58,050
-Yes it's not kidney disease in the family. The only thing I can say is that my father

259
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:03,460
he starts to get a little rheumatism.

260
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:15,220
My grand mother had arthritis but now to my father, they haven't diagnosed it

261
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:24,140
but I noticed the last month that he is complaining of pain in the joints.

262
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:35,220
-Not exactly this. This does not explain your sensitivity of the kidneys.

263
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,960
Another thing which I would like to know is whether you took a lot of antibiotics

264
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,180
in your younger age?

265
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:58,550
-I know that I've used some penicillin in certain cases but now I'm very sensitive to that.

266
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,190
I react upon that.

267
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:09,160
-If they make a test on you, you have a reaction?
-Yes.

268
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,060
-Why you took penicillin?

269
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:34,220
-I took it one time for an inflammation of bronchitis but not pneumonia.

270
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:42,640
-What age?
-I've had it several times.

271
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:52,550
It seems that every time I get a cold, if I don't stop it,

272
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:58,130
it's easily  affects the respiratory tract.

273
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:20,300
I also sometimes when I was working very heavy, I felt some pressure in my chest.

274
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,710
-As if you can not breathe properly?

275
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:32,800
-Yes, it seems more like cardiological. I checked it but everything was OK.

276
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:46,300
They couldn't detect any problem there.

277
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,560
-How many times you took penicillin?

278
00:39:51,060 --> 00:40:00,950
-During the last 20 years maybe I took 3-4 times.

279
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:07,310
-For how many days?
-Just for about a week.

280
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:14,540
But now I know that I'm very sensitive, so I don't take it anymore.

281
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:19,050
-But do you take other antibiotics now?
-No.

282
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,210
-You don't get anymore these colds?
-No.

283
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:28,780
-How many years since you did not have anymore this sensitivity to colds?

284
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,140
-It's about 5 years.

285
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:41,640
-Since when did you find out that you had the problem with the kidneys?

286
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:49,700
-That was when I came back from the States about 10 years ago.

287
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:59,600
I took all kinds of tests for the kidney and they found out that kidney function was good,

288
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:08,100
my creatinin was good, everything was good except from that albumin.

289
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,600
-They found out about the albumin in the urine how many years ago?

290
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,110
-About 10 years ago.

291
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:29,350
-Together with the colon, the hemorrhagic colitis?
-Yes.

292
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,600
-So this started practically together?

293
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:49,520
-Yes, the first sign was the colitis and then my diarrhea stopped and 1-2 months after,

294
00:41:49,620 --> 00:42:01,370
the kidneys started. Also the other sign was very sensitivity to light.

295
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:11,270
-The pupils stayed dilated?
-One small, one big.

296
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:14,030
-Which is dilated?

297
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:30,370
-The left one was big and the right one was very very small and very sensitive to light.

298
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:33,180
-All day or in the morning when you wake up?

299
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:41,180
-Especially in the morning and when I come down to the southern areas

300
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:48,280
where the light is very sharp, I couldn't see anything, I had to use dark glasses.

301
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:58,510
-In the morning you had to keep one eye closed for how much, two minutes or half a minute?

302
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:04,360
-Probably half a minute, I really had to concentrate on opening.

303
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,260
-Let me still understand the pathology.

304
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:22,700
You had the last budge of penicillin how many years ago?

305
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:32,120
-Probably about 5 years ago.

306
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:40,940
-And since then you did not have anymore this sensitivity to the respiratory

307
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,150
or you did have?
-Yes.

308
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,450
-But not as severe.

309
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:56,630
-No, but always I notice that every time I get a cold and my bronchitis

310
00:43:56,730 --> 00:44:02,710
and I have to cough all the time and that's the same with my family.

311
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,450
My mother when she gets a cold, she always have it down there.

312
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:20,210
-The sinuses are not affected?
-No, down there the chest. right away.

313
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:24,520
-Did you smoke before?

314
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:44,620
-I never smoked and I take a glass of wine with the food but I don't drink alcohol.

315
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:52,880
It is very seldom but I can do it. I mainly drink water.

316
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:17,690
You see a lot of investigation which is going on not only on homeopathic way

317
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:23,750
but try to understand the pathology and being able to predict what is going to happen,

318
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:29,120
to know when something is happening in the future during the treatment.

319
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:36,520
Unless you do this kind of investigation you will not be able at a certain moment...

320
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:42,360
You will be confused because what is going to happen here in this case is as you treat

321
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:48,020
and if your treatment is successful, that means the kidneys are getting better and better,

322
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:54,020
then this sensitivity which has gone, it will come back.

323
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:59,850
So he will develop a kind of bronchitis again and you have to treat that bronchitis

324
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:06,740
by that time correctly with Homeopathy to promote his health and to bring back health,

325
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:09,360
if that is possible.

326
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:14,750
And that's why I make all this investigation, so I can see how it started

327
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,600
and how its' going to end up.

328
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:28,350
A little bit of colitis, some bronchitis may appear eventually, more easily colds.

329
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:45,110
I can feel because the pathology is so gross, you may not get homeopathic symptoms.

330
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,860
The disease is concentrated on the physical body.

331
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:16,760
-The special diet and it is under Dr [name] he is a specialist on biological medicine.

332
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:24,750
I went through it for one week, drink just juices and vegetarian things

333
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:28,350
because I had very much belief in that.

334
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:47,920
I was supposed to come over to you some years ago but at that particular time

335
00:47:48,020 --> 00:48:02,970
I had taken cortisone some period before and also I got much edema.

336
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:15,090
I could feel that I was breathing very heavy, so I didn't take the chance to come to the heat.

337
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:41,230
-My thoughts at this moment are that first of all here we have a case

338
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:50,510
which it appears to have some severe pathology but at the moment the organism is in balance.

339
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:52,570
There is balance.

340
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:13,480
The peculiarity of the things that he has spoken is the way that he has to press

341
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:22,890
in order to urinate and that peculiarity reminded me of Pareira brava.

342
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:32,640
Pareira needs to press really but it goes down to the knees actually to be able to urinate.

343
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:39,900
When it becomes difficult the urination, it has to go down and press the abdominal muscles.

344
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,480
You don't have to do that. Did you ever did that?

345
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:49,230
Did you try to see if the urination was better if you had just go down to your knees

346
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:55,730
and bend forward and then press whether the urination would be better?

347
00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:02,710
-No. I just know that I can stand and urinate for some time

348
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:11,790
but just the last I really had to press and of course if I press my abdomen

349
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:17,900
because I have pressed so hard, I'm afraid to get my bowel movement too.

350
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:32,790
Another thing I forgot to tell you is that on the last test my iron deposit is very low

351
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:36,150
and I'm also very low on Magnesium.

352
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:48,550
Of course I had to take some iron supplements in hospital but I react on taking iron

353
00:50:48,650 --> 00:51:06,560
because my stomach is reacting. But I also take vitamin C and I take mineral supplements

354
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:19,890
and vitamin C and E.

355
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:36,470
I feel very little energy because my hemoglobin is low, my blood pressure is low,

356
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:46,220
all the values are low and after that situation it has changed dramatically.

357
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:55,460
My hemoglobin was more than 100% before and I've always been very active in sports

358
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:07,450
but now I can walk but of course it is very difficult in walking steps,

359
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:16,950
especially when I've been sitting and I start to walk, I always have a chance to faint,

360
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,300
so I have to take it very slow.

361
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:32,150
-What is your temperature of the body? Is it usually low?

362
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:45,900
-I just notice that I'm very easily freezing. I have a property in Portugal.

363
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:56,170
I'm living in Oslo and I have a wife and a child in Portugal.

364
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:01,660
I'm usually travelling down there once the month.

365
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,560
-There you feel better?

366
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:16,330
-Of course in Portugal some parts of the year is very cold there too

367
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:23,560
because it is near the Atlantic ocean and it is very humid but even though is not so cold

368
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:30,330
like in Norway for me it feels very cold. I'm freezing down there.

369
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:41,310
As he describes his symptoms another remedy which comes to my mind

370
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:45,910
and I'm  investigating is Acetanilidum.

371
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:13,050
What I wanted to ask, if in your experience has anybody heard about that symptom

372
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:19,560
where he says he has photophobia of one eye in the morning?

373
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:29,320
Has anybody had a case with onesided photophobia in waking up in the morning?

374
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:32,980
Nobody.

375
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:48,800
I have seen it a few times. This is a symptom which shows some serious problems in the organism,

376
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:56,490
which they may not develop immediately but you will see that something is going on

377
00:54:56,590 --> 00:54:57,470
which is serious.

378
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:02,280
I've seen it in cases of Lupus erythematosus.

379
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:12,700
-Usually in the morning close my left eye, which is the weaker eye,

380
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:19,470
when I go out into the sun, this is weaker that I used to wonder some time,

381
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:26,640
it is a muscle problem but I feel that there is too much light generally,

382
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:34,570
so I close one eye but always the left eye, so I get less amount of general light.

383
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:39,800
So in a way of photophobia of one side.

384
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:45,160
-But that is a strong photophobia, that is a very pronounced symptom.

385
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:59,560
-I found in the picture that in the middle of the face it was always very white,

386
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,550
the nose and this part.

387
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:11,300
About the kidneys I was thinking, what was the separation made to him

388
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,970
because he seemed very quiet and he said the separation but still we are friends.

389
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:23,800
But then I thought when the kidneys in the Chinese medicine has something to do

390
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:30,310
with my life and my energy and many years later on after the separation

391
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:33,710
I had lost so much energy.

392
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:40,660
So I thought the kidneys might be affected by the separation.

393
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:45,090
-I don't think he said after the separation he lost the energy.

394
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:54,740
He was here during that time, during the whole course and we were observing him.

395
00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:03,940
He had to sleep about 90% of the time, he could not keep, his energy was very low,

396
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,210
he had to sleep during the class 90% of the time.

397
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:11,910
That is what he describes here, I have no energy when I go upstairs,

398
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:20,490
when I have to move the energy is very low, the blood pressure is very low

399
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:24,120
and the anemia is there.

400
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:35,500
That is why at this stage I have been thinking of the remedy Acetanilidum.

401
00:57:43,330 --> 00:58:01,490
It says here, if you open the Materia Medica and you read, it says depresses the respiration,

402
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:09,230
the blood pressure, lowers temperature, depresses the heart, cyanosis and collapse,

403
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:19,990
increase susceptibility to cold, destroys red blood cells.

404
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:30,220
Heart weak, albuiminuria, edema of feet and ankles.

405
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:44,060
You see, you can be trying to find this remedy through a keynote, through projections,

406
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:49,240
he has some of this, that. All that ...

407
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,730
Here you have to concentrate, you have to find the remedy.

408
00:58:54,830 --> 00:59:00,820
He says when they took my reactions it was zero, it was no reactions

409
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:09,310
and Acetanilidum is exactly that, it depresses all the vital functions of the human body.

410
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:17,320
The respiration goes low, the blood pressure goes low, the albumin is lost

411
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:21,560
and then we have a very weak individual with no kidneys.

412
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:25,810
The kidneys are broken down, the heart is affected, the respiration is affected,

413
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:29,840
the blood pressure is affected, he can not...

414
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:36,730
Once you get this idea all together and put it all together,

415
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:40,780
you say this is the idea of Acetanilidum.

416
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:49,020
Are you going to find it through the Repertory? No. You try to find it as much as you like,

417
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,440
you will never get the remedy.

418
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:59,120
Because he was sleeping very much in Opium there is a keynote, you will give Opium.

419
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:04,620
But he is sensitive to pain, he says I'm pain sensitive.

420
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:13,780
Opium is not sensitive to pain, it is actually the opposite. They don't feel the pain.

421
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:31,720
-Found in rubrics eyes photophobia, pupils contraction, unequal, contraction is difficult.

422
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:43,030
In orthodox Medicine is clear that the contraction helps to overcome the photophobia

423
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:52,800
and the remedy in this rubric is Nitric acid, one single remedy.

424
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:57,190
-Yes but there is Natrum arsenicosum also that has this.

425
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:07,210
What I say is that if you go and look for these little things...

426
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:12,860
First you don't have the totality. What is the totality? There are no symptoms.

427
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,410
You don't have the essence.

428
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:20,260
There is no essence in this case, there is no the essence of Nat. mur. or Sulphur.

429
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:24,320
There are no keynotes to guide you.

430
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:34,870
One keynote says Nitric acid, Nat. Arsenicum, Opium and then you go to

431
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:47,780
what we call the essentials. The essential of this is the depression of all his functions.

432
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,200
These are the essentials.

433
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,470
Which is the remedy that produces that?

434
01:01:54,240 --> 01:02:01,080
I don't know if you got the idea. Still it's quite a lot of interview.

435
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:13,380
The idea is that every now and then the kidneys break down, starts the albumin

436
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:20,620
and if he does not take the chemotherapy, this will not stop.

437
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:27,040
So he has to take several drugs at the same time in order to stop the crisis

438
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,220
and then he waits for the next crisis.

439
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,450
Then the kidneys break down and there is a flood.

440
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:40,710
So he had to take the sentoxan.

441
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:06,110
The problem that we have at this moment is how we can control,

442
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:12,610
so you give the remedy maybe is better, the sentoxan comes, then the chemotherapy comes,

443
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:15,110
it breaks down, back again, forward.

444
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:23,850
You see it will affect your treatment if you don't have the possibility to correct the basic.

445
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:37,400
Because he will put on 30 kilos, he will just keep all the water inside, it is also dangerous.

446
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:48,030
The idea is you find the correct remedy that may correct the kidneys, only then there is hope.

447
01:03:52,550 --> 01:04:04,680
This is what I say. In every case there is an impact, there is a center of gravity.

448
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:10,760
If you go along and you look upon little things around...

449
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:24,730
As Hahnemann said, get the essentials, don't look for details, they are not important.

450
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:30,750
Find the aphorism, on which aphorism he says that.

451
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:45,240
In this case there is an information about his essentials, about the remedy

452
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:52,980
which I read to you, anemia, albuminuria, depresses, low blood pressure,

453
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:58,410
low temperature, freezing.

454
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:10,870
If we try to find some mental-emotional symptoms, it will be very difficult

455
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:16,310
because once you see the disease is so much localized in the physical body,

456
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:17,840
forget the mental-emotional.

457
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:23,820
It is personality things you will be mixing.

458
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:32,150
-I'd like to ask if he has sweets and how many eggs he is eating the day?

459
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:39,880
-How many eggs?
-3-4 eggs per day.

460
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:46,640
-In what form?
-I boil them.

461
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:52,260
-Soft?
-No soft, hard-boiled.

462
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:02,810
-I would like to give two observations. One is he is licking his lips quite frequently

463
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:07,230
and what really astonished me, when I saw the man for the first time last year,

464
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:20,730
to me he seemed so strong and so powerful and that was the same in this interview then.

465
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:25,240
It's so astonishing that with such an outward appearance, inwardly you can have

466
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:28,100
such a broken down organism.

467
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:42,150
-If anybody had seen the case originally, if you remember his color

468
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:49,240
was not the same as it is today, much more pale.

469
01:06:51,680 --> 01:07:11,100
And we will hear what happened after Acetanilidum and he has to give a follow up today.

470
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:20,150
So we see the changes, we see how we proceed with such a case.

471
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:34,850
Actually he has two Professors of urology who are looking after his case in Norway

472
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:42,470
and when he told them, he is going to Greece to be treated,

473
01:07:42,570 --> 01:07:52,240
they said well anybody who will cure you, he must go for a Nobel Prize.

474
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:09,810
The interesting thing, they said it in June and I got the announcement in October

475
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:24,650
but he said one of these two Professors are one of those who can nominate a candidate.

476
01:08:25,150 --> 01:08:31,630
Not everybody can nominate a candidate, they allow certain Professors to do that

477
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:38,660
and one of these two Professors is one of those who can nominate. I said OK, just remind him.

478
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:45,070
A little bit later. We will see.

479
01:08:49,570 --> 01:09:00,630
This kind of statement from the medical profession so many times

480
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:05,610
they have been surprised and so many times they kept quite.

481
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:08,900
They never said a second thing.

482
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:23,110
-That Prize winner should give the whole information, which height did you give?

483
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:31,590
-I will say in the follow up, I will give you all the details what we did with the potency.

484
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:39,800
-But as I remember, you said not to take anything until he has the albuminuria

485
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:45,760
coming again, if I'm not forgetting.

486
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:52,630
When we did the case, you didn't give immediately the remedy.

487
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:57,400
You said, if you have a relapse, then take it and we will see.

488
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,800
-Yes, he started actually taking the remedy because the relapse

489
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,490
was coming every 15-20 days.

490
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:09,230
It's not a matter of waiting too long to have the relapse.

491
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:18,410
Most probably he started immediately in June already, last June.

492
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:26,750
So you have to correct the kidneys, the anemia here, the blood pressure...

493
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:35,900
How difficult it is for established Medicine to correct all that?

494
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:44,410
Give him Effortil to rise the blood pressure and the kidneys will collapse.

495
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:54,580
Give him iron and his digestive system will collapse.

496
01:10:56,010 --> 01:11:01,150
You know the ferrum is not tolerated very easily by people who have colitis.

497
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:06,520
You can aggravate colitis very easily because they have ulcerative colitis,

498
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:18,290
they go into anemia, they say take now ferrum and then the organism goes into pieces.

499
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:29,600
The Time Magazine, as you know, has an article on this [name]

500
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:40,210
who espouses the idea of herbs. Go back to herbs, eat garlic, garlic will cure everything.

501
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:51,960
Now Time Magazine has a big article about him and about another one.

502
01:11:56,360 --> 01:12:03,020
And they are very critical of course about what he is doing.

503
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:10,260
They ask some medical people also but it is very strange that if there is a serious

504
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:20,790
methodology which can deal with diseases, which is Homeopathy, nobody is interested.

505
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:31,190
Like he investigated marihuana. He says marihuana is a light drug, you can take it

506
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:37,190
but when I see the cases who have taken marihuana and I evaluate these cases,

507
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:43,800
I see how much damage marihuana has done on the brain of these people.

508
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:49,110
They become slow, they become very mild, they become very gullible,

509
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:54,110
there is no will power, the will power has gone down, the mental acute,

510
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:58,830
the mental potency has gone down, they can not think consequently,

511
01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:04,460
they can not sustain a mental effort...

512
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:12,630
All these things and he says why you make such a big fuss about it?

513
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:16,270
Make it legal, destroy the planet.

514
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:22,770
On the one hand he says don't take antibiotics, take garlic and onion

515
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:25,270
and on the other hand he says take marihuana also.

516
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:31,360
You see the confusion which is in the mind of these people unfortunately.
