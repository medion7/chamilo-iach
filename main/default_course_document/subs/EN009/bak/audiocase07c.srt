1
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,540
-Could you give me a report of what happened after the medicine?

2
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:39,720
-I was aware that if it was working, as it should, I would have some symptoms,

3
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,350
I was looking for them.

4
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,760
After I took the medicine I went up north in Norway in different situation,

5
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:57,770
different place working too much, working hard, so the situation was tense.

6
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:05,710
In this period, the first days of June I had this neck pain.

7
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,190
-Stiffness?

8
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:18,070
-Stiffness and pain. This is the only physical change I could register.

9
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,560
-How long it lasted?
-Three days.

10
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,870
-And you took no medicine?
-No.

11
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,290
-You let it go.

12
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,860
-I was a bit unsure whether I should register this as a symptom

13
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:50,350
because this appeared also during the trip from Oslo up north in the car,

14
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,960
so it could have been from the car.

15
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:02,040
-Yes sure. You just report everything and then we will assess.

16
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:14,210
Just give all the information. What other things you have noticed?

17
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,710
-Physically nothing.

18
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:29,680
-You went to work up north and you worked hard in what situation?

19
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,540
-In a restaurant.

20
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:38,690
-Did you have the physical strength to work?
-Oh yes, a lot.

21
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:45,290
-This was normal for you or you felt that you had more energy than usual?

22
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:57,690
-I'm not sure. I was very active but it was a situation where there was nothing else

23
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:05,040
to do than work, I was working all the time, I had to.

24
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:16,940
I had a lot of energy and I didn't have time to sit apathetically, I didn't have time for that.

25
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,540
It didn't bother me.

26
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:29,300
-Where do you attribute this energy? To the situation?

27
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,520
-Maybe.

28
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,540
-You didn't feel that the medicine made you feel better in general so it gave you energy?

29
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:41,790
-It's hard to tell.

30
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,870
-What changes you were expecting from the medicine?

31
00:03:49,330 --> 00:04:03,520
-I was expecting some of my previous infections would come out again like pain in head

32
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,620
or the gonorrhea, the venereal diseases.

33
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,690
-Do you want to take out your jacket because I'm afraid it's too hot here.

34
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:22,790
-Yes. It's not as hot as it looked.

35
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:34,540
What do we expect to hear in this case to assess that the remedy is working?

36
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:45,230
What has to change?
-The anxiety and fear.

37
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,740
-The anxiety and fear of the disease in general.

38
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,730
The fear of the disease that we consider it maybe normal, it is not normal.

39
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,220
It is too much and therefore if the remedy is acting, this fear of the disease

40
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,910
will be taken away to a great extend.

41
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:17,060
Apart from the fact that the energy level has to climb and apart from the fact

42
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:24,570
that the sub-maxillary glands, which are swollen, have to go away.

43
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:41,710
And also if this person with the syndrome of loneliness forgets about this,

44
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,660
there is no mentioning it anymore of the loneliness.

45
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:52,150
He will see the world with other eyes, with different eyes.

46
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,900
This is in October 87.

47
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,800
-Did you have any sexual contact during that time?
-No.

48
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:34,690
With nobody. How were your glands in general? Are they swelling?

49
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:48,020
-This, no symptom. All the things, they disappeared.

50
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,160
-Can you tell me if there is any change in your character, your personality,

51
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:05,330
your way of dealing with the situation?

52
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:16,760
-I feel very full of many things, positive and negative and maybe the negative

53
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,110
is taking more and more over. I'm getting full of fear.

54
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:30,260
-Fear of?
-Fear of doing things.

55
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,830
-Sexual things?

56
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:40,590
-That too of course but I don't take challenges at work, the day challenges,

57
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,680
which is easy and I think more cowardly.

58
00:07:52,980 --> 00:08:00,520
I feel more and more fear, every day fear situations. I don't have the guts.

59
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,150
-You don't have the guts to do what?

60
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,050
He feels he doesn't have the guts. You see how he perceives?

61
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:20,150
He doesn't have the guts to do, the courage. I'm more cowardly now.

62
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,900
- You don't have the guts to do what? Can you be more precise?

63
00:08:49,730 --> 00:09:02,220
-I wanted to have a career, I wanted to do the best of what my talents are

64
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,570
and when I learned about my infection I thought this was really...

65
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,720
I must hurry because now there is not much time left, that's the time of thought you get.

66
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:21,070
Now this has changed and I don't want to do things, be more like this.

67
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:29,150
I don't think I can do, I don't have the self-confidence anymore.

68
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,630
You see he goes through a phase, where before he says I'm going to die,

69
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:40,970
I have to do things quickly, so I can live the space of time that has left for me.

70
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:47,310
And then he says now I seem to sit back and I don't take initiative,

71
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,230
I don't want to do anything.

72
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:57,720
So it's a phase for which he is going through, thinking, changing, why?

73
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:04,900
What has changed is the metabolism inside, if we put it on a physical level.

74
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:03,960
-We talked about it last time I was here too, about the fear of being lonely

75
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,410
and this is getting stronger.

76
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,120
-Tell me more about yourself, how you feel now? Just describe.

77
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:54,020
-Confused, I have to pick thoughts or I should try and go around

78
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:02,270
or I should try to do my career, even though I don't have the self-confidence,

79
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,360
as a radio reporter.

80
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,710
-The radio reporter that is what you like?
-Yes this is what I'm doing.

81
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,790
-As a journalist.

82
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:31,620
What element is missing from the previous interview in his character?

83
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:39,380
-The intensity.
-He is not intense.

84
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,770
-The joking.

85
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,620
-The joking, the performing, he is not performing anymore.

86
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:56,050
He is more looking upon things, he is serious.

87
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:05,460
-Smugness.
-What is this? Australian expression?

88
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,790
-Self-satisfying.

89
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,580
-I think he never had the guts but now he realizes it.

90
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,080
-It doesn't matter.

91
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,860
-You don't have the courage to do that?

92
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,690
-No, I don't have the courage to do that and I don't have the initiative to go around.

93
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,040
I do nothing instead.

94
00:13:53,990 --> 00:14:00,210
-Did you stop working on the North?
-I work as little as possible.

95
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,860
-But you said in the beginning that you worked quite a lot.

96
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,440
-That was in the restaurant business this summer. That was for the last two months.

97
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,690
I had no choice.

98
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,870
-But you had all the energy to do it.
-Yes.

99
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,520
-How is your energy now?

100
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,030
-If there was something I had to do, I would do it.

101
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:29,640
I have a lot of energy inside but I don't feel like I have been able to get it out

102
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,780
because I'm so confused.

103
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,700
-Do you lose any weight?
-On the contrary.

104
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,350
One thing we have to remember once a person is getting better,

105
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:46,210
it is always that better it is connected with some activity, creativity which is taking place.

106
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,350
You have somebody who has never worked in his life and you give a remedy,

107
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,410
don't expect that the next day he will go and work. He is going to go through different phases,

108
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:07,650
thinking, stimulating from the environment and then eventually...

109
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,210
If you see a schizophrenic is getting better, the first thing he will get, he will get a job,

110
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,130
when he is really better. He will say now I want to work.

111
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:25,110
It is a great thing for a schizophrenic to see this happening,

112
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,940
I want to go to work or a mentally deranged person.

113
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,780
Once we see this creativity coming up, then we know the person is really getting better.

114
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,860
And what is better after all? Health. What is health?

115
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:44,780
It is the measure to which we can be creative. To that measure we are healthy.

116
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,870
If we can be creative all the time, we are absolutely healthy.

117
00:15:52,870 --> 00:16:00,630
When we sit back, I can't think, I can't do anything, to that extend we are diseased.

118
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,530
-Do you lose any weight?
-On the contrary.

119
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:18,130
-How much weight did you put?
-Maybe 3-4 kilos.

120
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:36,960
But that is much in my part because I never was so much in my life.

121
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,960
Everybody tells me that I'm going to lose weight.

122
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:52,440
The normal for AIDS positives is to lose weight, when you are getting sick,

123
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,050
so I don't want to have the symptom of losing weight because then I feel sick.

124
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,460
Maybe that's why I eat.

125
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:07,440
-Whether you eat or drink it doesn't matter, when the disease is taking over

126
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,690
but most probably the treatment is helping you.

127
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,870
-Maybe.

128
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,690
-You have quite good energy, the glands are not anymore painful

129
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:30,690
that they used to be and your appetite is good, you are putting on weight

130
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,870
and you have some more moral problems.

131
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,780
You must be having a lot of turmoil inside you concerning the possibility of having

132
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,780
an affair infecting somebody.

133
00:17:51,880 --> 00:18:05,190
These are the problems which are very strong problems for everybody and in spite of this fact

134
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,790
I don't see that you are doing bad at all.

135
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,860
-I must say when I compare myself with others...

136
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:24,610
Another point which was in favor of Causticum was the fact that he did not go

137
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:33,110
and have relationships. Do you understand that?

138
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,710
Because he does not want to infect others and he holds back.

139
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,210
Not all AIDS people will do that.

140
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:07,030
-... and the others have more specific problems like the one is thinking about death all the time,

141
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,530
another one is just very apathetic, not able to go to work or anything.

142
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:17,880
They have more specific problems, I feel a little more cheered and positive.

143
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:28,360
-You have a little bit blisters here. When did they come up?

144
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,060
-One week ago.

145
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:38,630
-Were you specifically stressed that week? Any particular stress?

146
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:50,020
-I'm particularly stressed always, that's my character but these I believe is normal herpes,

147
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:57,780
which I first had many years ago when I was in India. It was very big

148
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,030
because of the humidity it was spreading it.

149
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:06,460
I tend to get this once or twice the year in winter combined with the cold.

150
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,210
But this is very small, it's going away already. Sometimes it gets big.

151
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,710
-I see.

152
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,110
-You remember the last time we spoke about your character?

153
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:41,210
You described yourself as a moralist and you explained different things that you were feeling,

154
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:50,150
especially concerning people who are put down.

155
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:59,800
Whenever you saw injustice, somebody to be put down, you were very exploding and reacting.

156
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:06,040
How is that aspect of your character after the treatment?

157
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,270
-The same.

158
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,880
-I don't hear your voice saying strongly.

159
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:27,520
-I must admit that I knew this question would come because I know that it should have changed,

160
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,870
I've been told.

161
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:37,210
-You have been told that it should have changed? Who told you?

162
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,210
You see how bad it is to tell a person this we expect to change?

163
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:57,720
Because you do not get a real feedback after that. It's useless.

164
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:10,870
-So what do you say?
-I can't say I see a change.

165
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:16,620
-Were you in a situation where you felt that something wrong was done to somebody and

166
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,700
then you reacted or you had no chance to check it actually?

167
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:29,050
-Yes I had a situation where I reacted just as before.

168
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:33,050
-Can you tell me what it was?

169
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:41,780
-One month ago outside a discotheque in Oslo a black guy went by

170
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:52,860
and the white guy calling him you bastard and I run after the white guy and kicked him.

171
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,550
I wanted to get the hell out of him. That's a normal reaction for me.

172
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:06,050
I didn't fight with him, I don't like to fight with people but I like to scare them.

173
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,140
He applauds.

174
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,880
Now he is a Causticum.

175
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,880
-Any other reaction?

176
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:15,620
-In my radio work I'm more an idealist and being a professional carrier for my own set.

177
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:23,110
I mean I do it because I want to change the world, when I make programs it's

178
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:26,960
because I think it's worthy to make that program.

179
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:41,470
Whatever I do, I do it in this aspect of trying to improve, to show...

180
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,450
-Is anything of your character that you didn't' t say last time and you wanted

181
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:57,290
to complete the picture this time?

182
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:05,530
Is anything that you felt either you misguided me or you didn't tell me at all

183
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:08,470
that you wanted to speak now?

184
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:22,950
-The only thing I've listened to at myself after the meeting and the only thing I felt maybe

185
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:34,460
it could be misunderstood is when you asked me about the sexual desires.

186
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:43,700
I interpreted the question as if are you a sexist or are you not?

187
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:57,390
And I said I'm not a sexist but I'm none either. I have a very active sexual desire life.

188
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:06,140
It's important part of my life and you were asking about how many partners?

189
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:20,120
I don't remember the number I said but if it was up to me, I would have a lot more partners.

190
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,800
That is my desire rather than the actual number.

191
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,550
So I wanted to correct that.

192
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:40,560
-Still I'm not clear, when you say sexist what do you mean?

193
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:47,310
-To me sexist is a person who is thinking sex all the time.

194
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,540
-And you are not that type?
-No.

195
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,200
-But sometimes you are, you are saying.

196
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:59,710
Sometimes you are preoccupied with sex a lot and many other times you are not.

197
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:02,700
Is that what you are stating now?
-Yes.

198
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,700
-If it was up to you, you would have much more partners.

199
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,220
Is that what you said now?
-Yes.

200
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:26,610
-What I was enquiring is whether you might have had infections because of multiple partners?

201
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:34,050
Whether you might have had multiple infections because of this situation?

202
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:41,200
-Then my answer is the same with the last time. The frequency wasn't any higher

203
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,400
than I said, I was not lying.

204
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:54,970
-Is anything else that you wanted to correct from what you said last time?

205
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:02,860
-It's a bit hard for me to remember all the talks that we went through, so if you give me some clues,

206
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,050
maybe I could remember.

207
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:24,040
-You said to the practitioner, you told her that you were not satisfied with the interview

208
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:29,710
because they were things that you wanted to say, that you did not say.

209
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,910
Do you remember what you wanted to say and you did not have the chance to say,

210
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,220
so you can say it now?

211
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:58,370
-That is difficult because what I was dissatisfied about was the setting as I found,

212
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:04,650
very distant and a bit cold, as an object, not a person.

213
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:11,150
I didn't have the chance to go to the depth of my explanations.

214
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,150
I felt like I was defending myself in that situation.

215
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:26,220
So I feel that everything we were talking about, I could say more about if I felt more safe.

216
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:39,970
This is not actual the setting for being open. I think that is a normal reaction.

217
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:53,120
What he is complaining about is that he did not feel the contact,

218
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:59,370
that he still had this feeling of alienation, of being alone, of loneliness.

219
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:04,680
Even if when he talked to me, the feeling remained, didn't go away.

220
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:16,580
What he felt very strongly is what others say about my interviews

221
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,270
that you can't not tell a lie to George.

222
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:26,250
Because I don't know, the way I look, I'm not involved, I don't want

223
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:32,850
to get involved emotionally into a consultation.

224
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:44,680
I like Anne or Helen and then I get very excited.

225
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:53,470
You have this fear, tell me about this fear. You suffer, poor you...

226
00:30:53,960 --> 00:31:01,420
In the end I will finish the interview and I will not know head or tails, unless I sit back

227
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:08,500
and I really objectively evaluate what he said to me. I'm not there to have an exchange,

228
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:20,500
I'm not a psychotherapist to have an exchange of energies and vibrations and all this... you cure.

229
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:27,920
You don't cure by that, you cure by sheer logic. I need to see what I have in front of me.

230
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:36,160
It's not an object, I'm much more concerned that anybody can ever think,

231
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:42,160
if he remembers me 20 years later, if I'm alive about his case,

232
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,910
I will say yes I gave you Causticum and say all the details.

233
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,850
How is that possible that I did not take into account,

234
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:59,620
if I remember so many years later after so many cases, unless I was very attentive.

235
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,830
But what he saw he could not bluff me, he could see that there is no way that

236
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:10,930
he could present himself the way he wanted to present himself to me.

237
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,430
This is what he is saying.

238
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:24,870
It will be so nice, oh you are such a nice person, save the world,

239
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,620
I also want to save the world.

240
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,970
We are friends and then he goes out and he says this doctor is so good.

241
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:42,970
He is full of love. Prescription? Forget it.

242
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,010
Confused prescription.

243
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:59,370
I've told you one of my doctors, a lady doctor, she was sitting there sending me the information.

244
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:06,270
It's so nice person and where are the symptoms? No symptomatology.

245
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:14,770
I was supervising in prescribing for the case and I said you didn't write the symptoms,

246
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:22,680
you got involved with the conversation. Would you please call him back to complete the picture?

247
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,930
She called him back, she said he is a schizophrenic.

248
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:37,930
When she looked upon the case, she saw that it was a very progressed mental case.

249
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:51,420
It's a manic depressive case where the mania in the period of mania they are so vivid

250
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,760
and so engaged into discussion and she got involved.

251
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:08,910
And what she saw it was a nice person, that is what I was reading all the time because

252
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:19,260
she was influenced by his vitality etc. But she did not see at all objectively the situation.

253
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:34,610
I got into another consultation room, there was another lady doctor, writing a case of colitis.

254
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:44,530
I looked at the patient, I read and it's only colitis symptoms.

255
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,660
I looked again the patient, I tried to find any mental symptoms nothing, no mental symptoms.

256
00:34:52,760 --> 00:35:02,910
I said it's impossible, this man is completely crazy and I can't see any mental symptoms,

257
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:06,770
not reporting anything. What shall I ask?

258
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:20,690
So I said to him do you take any medicine? He said no. He meant for the colitis.

259
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:31,330
I said he must be under strong medication and what I see is a picture of a mentally ill person

260
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:36,190
who takes a lot of drugs. I said are you sure? He said yes.

261
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:43,520
I said I don't mean medication for the colitis. Do you take medication for something else?

262
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:56,060
He says yes. What? He pulls out from his pockets a heap of medication.

263
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:07,680
I said to her what is this? He came to be treated for the colitis and he is crazy.

264
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:18,670
The colitis was the problem? I said you are not looking objectively.

265
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,760
He said the colitis, I have the pain.

266
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:33,930
No, sit back, observe, do not get involved, homeopath should not get involved.

267
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:41,170
He should not have a love affair from the consultation, he can have outside but not inside.

268
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:52,270
Because if you doubt, forget the patient. I'm saying it very openly, I make you aware.

269
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:30,800
What I hope to show you in this seminar is how a cure can take place in time.

270
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:41,520
Unless you perceive this idea, you will never have a cured case.

271
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:47,940
You will have successes in the beginning and failures in the end always.

272
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:56,340
Unless you perceive the person is doing well for these and these reasons not with judgment,

273
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,840
I don't want to judge a case and say he is doing well while he is doing worse,

274
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:07,340
but unless you do that and you perceive he is doing well, leave them alone, when you

275
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,590
see cure. In the end you will have happy people that have no problems.

276
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:17,590
If you don't perceive that, you will see unhappy people with a lot of problems

277
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,440
and you will be unhappy.

278
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:31,170
Please understand this point in Homeopathy because it is a point that has never...

279
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:34,420
according to my understanding when I see how people are prescribing

280
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,420
and I have made the mistakes myself and I'm talking about the mistakes I've made

281
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,020
and I've seen the effects...

282
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:56,190
Let us see now how this man who got Causticum is feeling one year later.

283
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,020
This interview is one year later.

284
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,090
-He didn't take any more dose?

285
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:10,840
-No more dose, as far as I remember.

286
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:19,030
Unless there is a relapse, a real relapse do not repeat the remedy.

287
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:49,850
Which is the date of this? July '88. It is close to one year. 14 months.

288
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:58,600
Before you start I wanted to say also a few things.

289
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:06,350
As we said with the Cicuta child, when he is going to be better?

290
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:15,340
When he will start having contact, not when the epileptic fits will be bigger or lesser,

291
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,530
the deeper level when he will start being better.

292
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:31,430
Cicuta, it has given different remedies and the parents are happy,

293
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:35,770
they see the child is doing better. But what is better?

294
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:46,430
One time the fits were this way and the other time the fits were another kind of convulsions

295
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:49,360
or a little bit less convulsions.

296
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:55,000
After one and a half year of treatment that the child had before,

297
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,440
the result is not only the same, it is worse.

298
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,780
He started with mild convulsions and ended with grand mal

299
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,030
He is a completely autistic child.

300
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,030
The child seemed not to be autistic from the very beginning.

301
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:15,680
At the age of 6 months he had some rapport.

302
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,680
Then he becomes completely autistic.

303
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:24,670
You can't say better the convulsions, a little bit better of this and of that,

304
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:30,690
the coughing is better and then the child is better. That is how we go wrong.

305
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,590
We don't perceive what is deep.

306
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:41,670
When the Stramonium child came in, we don't perceive that it is much better.

307
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:46,680
I didn't know what happened afterwards. What I know is that the child is better?

308
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,780
Why? More calm.

309
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:57,170
I can see it immediately and then some supporting elements are there,

310
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:01,030
some real hard facts are there.

311
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,360
Then wait.

312
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:16,090
I believe that the eye of the child it will be almost completely well and I hope

313
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:23,640
that Matias may have a checkup and you give us a report of the ophthalmologist.

314
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:35,700
Now this man he went through a phase, what he described.

315
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:41,190
Let us see what has happened now?

316
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:50,690
-You saw George in November last year, could you tell me how it is since then?

317
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:16,600
-He gave me another dose of Causticum, which I was to take...

318
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,060
That was placebo.

319
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,770
-I took it every week on Tuesday, I think it was for 10 weeks.

320
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:42,930
So I finished that in January. What I remember from this is that every Saturday

321
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:51,030
after I had taken it on Tuesdays, I had neck pains, each week.

322
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,240
I thought this is nothing, this has got nothing to do with this remedy

323
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:01,850
but in fact I must admit after I had taken the last pill...

324
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:09,490
It's very interesting for those who do not know Causticum, the Causticum has a stiffness

325
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:17,680
on one side of his neck and a pain it may appear on occipital protuberance.

326
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:22,410
And mostly they have stiffness on the neck. It is very interesting

327
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:29,660
because he takes placebo but the first observation that he had that is definitely a sign

328
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,990
that the remedy was correct.

329
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:39,490
Once we have a general amelioration and a keynote of the remedy appearing,

330
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:45,090
that is a confirmation that we have given the prescribed remedy.

331
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:49,580
When we have a general aggravation plus new symptoms of the remedy,

332
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,440
we have a proving of the remedy. You understand?

333
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:03,490
-In January I didn't take any more neck pain.

334
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:08,250
-You originally got neck pain the first time you took the Causticum?

335
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:14,010
What was the pain in relation to the glands?

336
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:19,490
-The back of the neck. I'm not sure whether it was the muscles or the bones

337
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:22,860
but I think it is the muscles.

338
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,760
-It was an ache or stiffness?

339
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:39,930
-Ache. The first time I took it it was so bad, it lasted three days, I could hardly move.

340
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:49,670
Autosuggestion almost. And we see it with sensitive people who have a kind of hysterical

341
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:53,750
streak that they can reproduce.

342
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:58,330
You give a remedy and they have a big reaction and then  they do well

343
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:03,250
and then at a certain moment they go towards a relapse.

344
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:08,680
You judge it is not a relapse and you give placebo and they bring out a kind of reaction

345
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:10,770
that they had in the beginning.

346
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:18,670
They say I had the same reaction as in the beginning. It means it is not a real relapse,

347
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,310
it is just the organism coming down, it is going to come up again.

348
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:24,250
You don't need to prescribe a remedy.

349
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:36,390
-It was so bad, it lasted for three days, I could hardly move but this time it was not that bad.

350
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:43,080
It was the same kind of ache and it lasted only for one day and it was gone again.

351
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:58,330
Do you see a change in his face? What is the change that you see?

352
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:01,660
How do you define that change?

353
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:25,250
-He became more mature.
-Not so frightened.

354
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:35,160
-It's not that frighten look that he used to have and he is more mature.

355
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,740
You will say is it possible that you give a remedy and the person matures?

356
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:47,820
It is possible yes, within a year different changes will take place inside

357
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,670
on a healthy organism now and you will see healthy reactions.

358
00:47:55,410 --> 00:48:02,660
Who has seen the Baryta carbonica case in Bern? How many have seen the Bar.carb.?

359
00:48:04,170 --> 00:48:08,410
I just got a report because her doctor is here.

360
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:20,400
She will give you the report, how well she is doing, going back to college, finishing the college,

361
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:31,250
lots of changes, real changes in real life, where she was hiding, she could not do anything.

362
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:43,650
-After that when I finished this cure my homeopath in Oslo,

363
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:55,330
she tested a remedy with using my hands, it is called organum triplex.

364
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:11,060
-I know yes. You have it with you because it is a combination of remedies, I think.

365
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:16,170
-No, I don't have them with me, it was liquid in bottles.

366
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:26,170
It was just this test and then different remedies in my hand.

367
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,820
-Did you have any symptoms at the time?

368
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:40,760
-No, she said she wanted to give it to me to give me extra strength after the cure.

369
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:44,360
It was most probably placebo, I don't believe she gave anything.

370
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:59,590
-When did you have that?

371
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:22,300
-I started in the beginning of March and I finished in the end of February.

372
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,150
-For 10 weeks you did that?
-Yes.

373
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:36,360
-So it was a week you took it or daily?

374
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:52,630
-Every 3-4 days. So far I haven't taken any more remedies.

375
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,120
-So how have you been this time?

376
00:50:56,220 --> 00:51:04,970
-Very well generally. I've been very active.

377
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,960
-Do you have a work? What are you doing?

378
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:19,200
-I've taken part in starting the Norwegian HIV positive organization

379
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:26,790
so I've been using my whole self into work.

380
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,460
-Because last time you had been working very little.

381
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:39,800
So you feel this is the area you want to be? What else has been happening?

382
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:49,950
-I have been busy, not like I have been told before, I have been very lazy

383
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:55,190
and having trouble getting up in the morning. Now I've been really getting up early

384
00:51:55,290 --> 00:52:02,050
and working hard, maybe it's been too much. I haven't have private life,

385
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:10,450
I have been very much concerned about this. I can not say I've done much rather than working.

386
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:20,200
-How is the work doing a lot of opposition because of the area of the work that you are doing?

387
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:33,800
-No, it has been easy. I had reduced the opposition in myself because it needs strength

388
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,860
to create something which is not there because there are always skeptical people around you.

389
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,460
So I had to use a lot of strength.

390
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:45,360
-Have you had the energy to do it?
-Yes.

391
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:56,450
-Good. You mentioned last time that you had a fear of loneliness, that was a problem for you.

392
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:59,090
What is happening there?

393
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:12,450
He had forgotten it. Did I say that? That is more or less what you expect.

394
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:16,800
This is what happens with the cases.

395
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:23,700
After a certain period of time once they get better, they completely forget how they were before.

396
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,730
So when you ask them to compare, they are not in a position to compare really.

397
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:33,240
What was happening and what they are now it is so totally different that they have disassociated

398
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:40,830
and they will say things that are not relevant really.

399
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:56,980
I remember a case of stammering and we have him on video and the year after in the follow up

400
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,080
I said how is the stammering? He said it's the same.

401
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:10,160
Then the whole class will say... and the other time... talking fluently

402
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:13,740
and he was saying the stammering is the same.

403
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:21,470
He had still a little bit of stammering but comparing the two videos you could see

404
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:23,250
the tremendous difference.

405
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:38,050
-What's happened then?
-I have been compensating in my work.

406
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:45,060
-When you are not working and you are on your own how do you feel, what you are doing?

407
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,060
-I always have a lot of people around me.

408
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,060
-You make sure that you have...
-Yes.

409
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,340
You see, is it possible that you always have people around?

410
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:04,050
What he explains now, I don't have time, the situation has gone out of his mind.

411
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:08,560
Loneliness is not something which is real, it is something that you feel inside.

412
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:13,310
It is a subjective feeling. So whenever you are alone in the house,

413
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,910
it comes this feeling of loneliness.

414
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:27,800
-I'm never alone but I have trouble getting this...

415
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,890
What the practitioner makes it's a mistake here.

416
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:38,910
She says you make sure that you have people around and he says yes, yes.

417
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:42,310
The patient did not say that. It's a different thing.

418
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:49,310
If the patient said I make sure that somebody is next to me all the time, it's different

419
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:55,750
when the practitioner says you make sure that you have somebody next to you, he says yes.

420
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:02,720
You see I can not go to London anymore and she is a very good practitioner who takes the case,

421
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:08,820
she is sensitive but from time to time she makes a mistake like everybody, like I'm doing.

422
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:14,160
I'm doing big mistake when I take a case where I put straightforward questions.

423
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:30,100
-So the loneliness is still there but I have been compensating

424
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:37,650
and I have trying to arrange my life so that I can't have that OK, I do it this way

425
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:41,350
and I'm satisfied.

426
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:46,100
-You don't have a close physical relationship?

427
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:55,850
-No, just partly but I have problems involving myself 100%. I get back.

428
00:56:55,950 --> 00:57:00,360
-Is it difficult to commit yourself? Why is that?

429
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:03,800
-Maybe this fear.

430
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,310
-Of what?

431
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:16,450
-Fear of not succeeding, fear of trying so hard. I think it's ordinary human fear of failing.

432
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,450
-What about confidence? Do you have confidence in yourself?

433
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:32,060
-I do, sometimes I have too much. When it comes to a certain point, I lose it

434
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:43,680
because on one hand I feel very clever, doing my job I'm very clever and I have big confidence

435
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:52,050
in my job, what I do. When it comes to my own feelings, it is who am I?

436
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:01,550
I don't know if that answered your questions.

437
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:10,950
-We will come back to that. How things have been physically? What about the glands?

438
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:14,510
Do you still have the swelling on your neck?
-No.

439
00:58:14,610 --> 00:58:16,010
-They have gone completely.
-Yes.

440
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:18,200
-Since when they have gone?

441
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:26,360
-They haven't been here since I was here last in October. There is nothing to say about it.

442
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:38,350
What I could say about the physical state is that I had some strange things,

443
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:43,180
I think it was a pain in my left knee, which I couldn't explain.

444
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,690
I'm not sure it was the left, it was one of the knees.

445
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:47,540
-Was that long ago?

446
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:58,370
-About one and a half month. It suddenly appeared, it suddenly disappeared.

447
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:08,600
On top of it I had some warts in my mouth. I didn't know what it was

448
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:22,700
and I asked my homeopath and she said it might have been this flash.

449
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,640
-What it did it look like?

450
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:35,140
-Little white marks which I think it is typical for HIV positives but it was very small

451
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,750
and in two days it disappeared.

452
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,620
-Anything else?

453
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:55,270
-Like my HIV friends, I have my herpes on my lip but very small.

454
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:00,680
-Is that coming more or less often because I had that it comes twice the year.

455
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:04,920
-No.

456
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:19,850
-It's always on your lip. What else?

457
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:28,890
-Nothing. I have been quite well because these are just...

458
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:38,340
The question is, is he well?

459
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:47,520
We don't know how much well he is with this disease.

460
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:54,420
What we know is that we did the best we could for his organism

461
01:00:54,520 --> 01:01:00,930
and after that we can do nothing at all.

462
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:08,920
If you try to boost up, forget it, you destroy the whole case very quickly, very fast.

463
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:15,690
What can you do is wait until he develops some symptomatology and going according

464
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,520
to that symptomatology, nothing else.

465
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:22,850
If you try in this case to do anything else, you just spoil the case.

466
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:30,340
-In the first follow up it was very difficult to see that he really improved

467
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:38,330
because what he said is I'm getting full of fear and then more and more fear, no courage

468
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:45,170
and then no more self-confidence, fear of loneliness is getting stronger.

469
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:59,500
There were several points at the previous interview where you had to evaluate these points,

470
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:03,190
you had to understand the process.

471
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:12,690
He is somebody and then he loses that attitude of quarrelling.

472
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:22,090
Maybe he will feel more coward but now he will not jump in situations and kick the other person

473
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:26,140
because he is a racist, he loses this element.

474
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:35,280
He is not going to lose it completely but that element is going to be transformed

475
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:39,640
into really creative situations.

476
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:46,580
Healthy people understand immediately what is destructive and they should avoid and

477
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,270
what is constructive and they should do it.

478
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:57,610
That's why a healthy person is going with the car and comes in front of you

479
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:04,750
and you are in the wrong side. If you are healthy person...

480
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:13,360
Stramonium comes out, opens the other door, pulls the man out of it and kills him on the spot.

481
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:18,940
This is a reaction, you will say it's his character, no it's not his character, it's his remedy.

482
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:31,930
Staphysagria what will do? He wants to kill, he wants to do the same thing but will not

483
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:41,340
dare to come out of the door. When he will go home, he will knock the wall and say,

484
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:47,690
I'm stupid why don't I get out and kill? That's a different reaction.

485
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:59,590
A Nux vomica will jump out and he will fight but most probably he will swear and say,

486
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:01,450
you stupid bastard.

487
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:08,600
A Tarentula will hit him, never mind what, he will hit the car. It is a different reaction.

488
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:15,090
A healthy man, when this happens, will understand that this man is under some sort of condition

489
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:23,280
that maybe he is drunk and says why you did that?

490
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,780
Especially if not a crash has taken place?

491
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:46,800
What we do is influenced so much by the pathology and that is why we appear

492
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:54,940
in the world in the way we appear. One appears this way, another appears that way.

493
01:04:55,950 --> 01:05:03,450
He does something which inwardly feels is something helping the others and he is happy.

494
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:11,350
The other thing injustice, when he was jumping up and talking about injustice,

495
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:14,100
he was not feeling? No, he was not feeling.

496
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:17,350
Because the organism knows when you do something constructive

497
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:20,030
and when you do something destructive.

498
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:28,930
-The first time he was in this period where he couldn't do anything, he was at home.

499
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:35,840
-Yes there is a phase for these cases that you have to wait, you have to understand

500
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:40,530
is the remedy active? Yes, wait and you will see.

501
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:47,540
Then you will see miracles but if you expect that you raise the dead, you go inside

502
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:52,650
and you say what happens and he is in coma.

503
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:57,620
Take a remedy, he comes back and everything is finished.

504
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,730
This is magic, forget Homeopathy.

505
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:10,870
Sometimes you will do that but if you believe that what you did it was really rising the dead,

506
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:12,470
it is finished.

507
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:21,720
Because it was a hysterical fainting and you gave some Lilium tigrinum and came back.

508
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:33,400
Just a fainting, you pull out your Carbo vegetabilis, you give it and comes up

509
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:44,900
and people who see it around say, my god how you did that? You are a magician.

510
01:06:48,150 --> 01:07:02,820
You know the story how I raised the dead cock? A dead cock.

511
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:10,060
While he changes the tape, I'll tell you the story.

512
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:21,710
I had some hens and the neighbor gave me his cock to be with my hens,

513
01:07:21,810 --> 01:07:27,970
so the eggs will be fertile. Somebody else offered me another cock.

514
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:34,970
He says don't take a lented cock, I'll give you your own. I said great, bring it.

515
01:07:35,070 --> 01:07:39,470
He brought the other cock and the two cocks started fighting.

516
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:53,820
I see fighting, I take the one cock of the neighbor's and put it inside a green house.

517
01:07:57,310 --> 01:08:00,730
The cock who was inside the glass would see the other cock outside

518
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:04,060
and would jump against the glass.

519
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:13,720
At a certain point I go to take the cock and to give it back and I thought the cock is dead,

520
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:20,070
lying down. I don't understand what happened, most probably it was too hot.

521
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:27,310
What shall I do with the cock? I take the cock, the cock is dead and I go to the neighbor.

522
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:41,290
Well I said this is your cock. I don't know what happened to the cock

523
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:48,040
but are you going to eat it because it must have died, it was alive two hours ago.

524
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,050
I can promise you.

525
01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:53,480
Are you going to eat it or shall I raise him back?

526
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:01,570
She says, you are joking?

527
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:07,190
In the meantime as I was walking from my house to the neighbor's house ,my mind was working.

528
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:09,470
What happened? What happened?

529
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:15,710
So I saw the whole scenery in my mind, what it must have happened it was that

530
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:18,180
so therefore he had a brain hemorrhage.

531
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,690
The cock was charging with his head against the glass.

532
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:27,030
One, two, three, four, five times then a brain hemorrhage, then he was out.

533
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,780
So I said are you going to eat it or shall I raise him?

534
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:38,870
She says, come on George it doesn't matter, we are not going to eat it, forget it, dead cock never.

535
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:46,020
I said OK, I left him downstairs I went home, I take some Arnica 10M, 50M I can't remember

536
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:50,610
and I went to the cock, opened his mouth and put the 10M.

537
01:09:54,360 --> 01:10:02,290
As soon as Arnica 10M touched his tongue, the cock did this, a movement.

538
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:18,450
I said to her, every hour you do that until the night when I come back.

539
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:25,960
In the night I come back. She says, you know what?

540
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:36,250
Every time I opened his mouth he did this, by the night he did it a few times.

541
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:39,450
I said by tomorrow he will be all right.

542
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:51,200
By tomorrow the cock was standing on his feet, by the night next day the cock was walking.

543
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:55,600
So I raised the dead! She said do you know some of the stuff?

544
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:05,200
It is absolutely a true story, a 100%, there is no...

545
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:13,340
I raised the dead and now what happened is in this family, the old mother of this couple

546
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:20,660
one day she comes out in the balcony and she says...

547
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:26,240
It is Sunday or Saturday, they can not find the doctor, she is not under my care the old woman

548
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:32,490
because she was taking a lot of other remedies and she says, George can you call the doctor

549
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:37,580
because my mother is out, is dying in coma.

550
01:11:38,330 --> 01:11:43,430
It was Sunday, I could not find. I said can I come and see her?

551
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:50,580
What happened? She said what happened, they forced her to eat,

552
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:58,910
she was not in a good state in the mind and the daughter did something that upset her,

553
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:13,180
something nasty and from that time they forced her to eat and she went out like that.

554
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:25,410
I said do you want me to raise her? She said, what do you mean, she is my mother

555
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:33,330
but I knew this woman gave hell to that couple, maybe they did not want to.

556
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:46,840
I go and get a dose of Ignatia 10M, I give it to her, within a minute she was back.

557
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,410
You understand how the fame goes about and what the other people think but what you know

558
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:59,010
is a different story. You know that this man is not cured.

559
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:06,740
So you have to wait and see. How long you wait? I don't know.

560
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:22,320
Before we can pronounce him cured, his HIV has to be negative and his whole organism...

561
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:28,260
At this moment we are not in a position to do anything more for this man.

562
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:38,410
You can give HIV antigen potentised, you can give proteins, antibiotics potentised,

563
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:40,820
all this is stupid.

564
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,160
Don't do anything of that type.

565
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:44,400
-He is having another test?

566
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:54,390
-He is not having another test yet, he is going to have but I don't believe that the test

567
01:13:54,490 --> 01:14:02,900
will be negative yet, no. I believe it is too short, within three years I believe that maybe

568
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,640
his test will go negative.

569
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:07,730
-You have seen the case?

570
01:14:07,830 --> 01:14:13,980
-No, I have not seen the case. I have seen cases that are improving yet

571
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:19,820
before we have an observation for at least 3-4 years we can not say anything.

572
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:24,320
Do not get the impression I'm saying that we can cure AIDS.

573
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:29,980
I'm showing you what is happening and if all the symptomatology goes away

574
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:35,570
and still we do not feel that the disease is really gone.

575
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:44,970
-Why...[ ]

576
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:48,320
-Because he has become coward.

577
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:02,750
Correct.

578
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:17,320
According to me he was doing too well to spoil this by the action of another remedy.

579
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:24,480
-If the first remedy made him have a clear picture?

580
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:33,820
-It was not a clear picture. The way he said, I'm coward now, I'll tell you how I explain that.

581
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,740
You don't listen to me, you are thinking your own thoughts.

582
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:52,890
-Fear of solitude. Now the second follow up there is no real big changes.

583
01:15:52,990 --> 01:16:12,400
He doesn't commit himself to personal relationship...Weakness of memory.

584
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:17,390
-Weakness of memory is not Lycopodium. You have to give Anacardium, Argentum nitricum etc.

585
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:24,150
but let us state a very good remark. What he does is a very good remark,

586
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:28,990
there is no question and everybody could have done it.

587
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:35,330
But let me explain what I hear. I will explain it to you.

588
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:45,380
When this person says, I have become cowardice, he most probably does not mean that.

589
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:52,230
What he means is that he lost this element of jumping up into a situation and fight.

590
01:16:53,480 --> 01:17:01,480
He observes the change in himself and he says to himself, have I become a coward?

591
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:08,630
Why? He lost this impulse and that is the action of the remedy.

592
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:15,880
What I explain therefore is that a remedy brought a balance on that level

593
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:20,990
which he calls coward. I become a coward.

594
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:24,630
-It's theorizing.

595
01:17:24,730 --> 01:17:28,480
-Well, it's a good theory perhaps, perhaps correct.

596
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:38,060
I wish we had the possibility in such cases to show you what happened if we gave Lycopodium

597
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,550
and what happened if we did not.

598
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:45,630
Since I do not have that possibility, you can always criticize me and rightly

599
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:49,970
because I accept it. The right criticism is something beautiful.

600
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:56,800
What he says is something very valid. And if he had done it and he was in my class

601
01:17:56,900 --> 01:18:03,050
and they are ready to get the diploma and he would say this explanation,

602
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:06,060
I would say wrong explanation, take the diploma.

603
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:08,560
You see?

604
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:14,400
Because according to my understanding it is wrong but he might be right,

605
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,500
I accept that he might be right.

606
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:23,900
But what I know from my experience is that if you touch such cases,

607
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,740
you usually spoil them and if you touch them with a close remedy, you spoil them.

608
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:43,370
What he is doing now, not to have a relationship, don't forget that these people,

609
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:50,810
immediately after they tell them you have AIDS, they attain a specific psychology.

610
01:18:50,910 --> 01:18:55,340
Because they are confronted with thousands of questions.

611
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:03,070
Now shall I have a relationship at all? The first thing is that I can not

612
01:19:03,170 --> 01:19:06,320
and there is a realization, that they should not have a relationship,

613
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:09,670
unless they give the disease to somebody else.

614
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:17,900
Then they are confronted with the possibility that they may have a relationship

615
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:24,000
which makes them worse, whatever they may think.

616
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:28,990
We have to take into consideration all that before we say why he didn't go yet

617
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:34,490
into a relationship? According to me what he is doing it is very healthy.

618
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:37,840
He says wait a moment, don't make a relationship.

619
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:48,840
If he would jump into a relationship, I would say not yet, not reach yet the state.

620
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:58,130
You remember the Nux vomica case with AIDS?

621
01:19:58,230 --> 01:20:03,060
He was having a relationship with a woman who had AIDS as well.

622
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:10,390
When he became strong, I told him you better stop this relationship and he did.

623
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:33,630
You remember another case, Thuja? I said this Thuja case he will have back his gonorrhea

624
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:38,560
most probably and he will go and get antibiotics.

625
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:43,090
It was exactly that, he had back his gonorrhea and took antibiotics.

626
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:49,380
And from Thuja he went to Medorrhinum, Medorrhinum stopped having relationships?

627
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:53,730
No, he kept on having relationships.

628
01:20:55,730 --> 01:21:02,310
So this reaction I consider the most healthy, I would say.

629
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:13,550
He is happy, he is satisfied, he is working, he has a lot of energy, glands are gone,

630
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:18,460
his health is quite good, wakes up refreshed in the morning, he sleeps good.

631
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,960
Why we should give a remedy?

632
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:27,960
That temptation I know it is very great but I have seen so many cases spoiled

633
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:34,560
that I would think very much before I give a remedy.

634
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:42,970
-George do you think is it possible at all that the HIV is negative ?

635
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:53,570
-I do not know. I can not pass a comment.

636
01:21:54,060 --> 01:22:01,790
I have seen the Australian antigen going negative under homeopathic treatment.

637
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:48,800
I have seen the thalassemia traits disappearing. I don't know here.

638
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:52,800
We have to see it a few times and then we may say yes it is really possible.

639
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:55,150
At this moment I cannot really say.

640
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:18,910
Seven months is too short or too long?

641
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:30,050
Absolutely, if you wait long enough, you will see year after year,

642
01:23:30,150 --> 01:23:33,230
the patient is getting better and better.

643
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:38,470
Don't give any remedy and you will see. I've told you many times when Bill Gray was

644
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:41,220
here, when he came to study for two years.

645
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:47,900
He left his patients there without a remedy and he tells the story himself.

646
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:53,050
Some people he would prescribe by correspondence and never see them again.

647
01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:58,400
Two years later he goes back, he says everybody was cured.

648
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:03,150
I never had such results when I was prescribing every month.

649
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:19,300
But make sure when to repeat the remedy, don't let a person die

650
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:22,400
when he needs a remedy at the same time.

651
01:24:25,900 --> 01:24:30,050
The man with the bleeding he is dying, you can't leave him, you put him in the hospital,

652
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:39,060
do something. You can't say he took a remedy, let's wait. He needed a blood transfusion,

653
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:42,300
otherwise he will die, what do you do? You give a blood transfusion.

654
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,650
Don't get me wrong.

655
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:54,650
-George is it wrong to prescribe on 2-3 keynotes of the remedy?

656
01:25:02,650 --> 01:25:07,880
-But you did not prescribe only on a few symptoms.

657
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:12,630
He takes in consideration the mental symptoms, amelioration after midnight,

658
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:18,730
he takes into consideration coward, he takes into consideration general symptoms and he prescribed.

659
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:38,230
-The first follow up he said he was angry...

660
01:25:44,730 --> 01:25:49,230
-But where is his anxiety now? The fear of death, the anxiety, all has gone.

661
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:57,230
-At the first follow up he said he wanted to eat a lot because he didn't want to lose weight.

662
01:26:02,740 --> 01:26:11,720
-I don't think he ate more than usual. I think his appetite became bigger

663
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:19,070
and maybe he ate normally, as much as he wanted. I didn't get the idea that he forced himself to eat.

664
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:26,300
The fact that he picked up weight it most probably says that his appetite was better

665
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:30,490
and he Eating perhaps a little bit more.

666
01:26:33,230 --> 01:26:41,630
One thing that we see in Causticum is that they have a strong metabolism,

667
01:26:41,730 --> 01:26:56,920
they are burning a lot, rather hyper active metabolism and that's why we see this intensity,

668
01:26:57,020 --> 01:27:00,570
the fire which they have inside them and they are usually thin.

669
01:27:01,810 --> 01:27:06,840
That element is taking away by Causticum and maybe he is eating the same amount of food

670
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:10,270
and we can check and maybe he still picks up weight.

671
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:17,340
The fact that he picks up weight also tells in favor of the Causticum action.

672
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:24,190
There are several points which I had to consider and I said no remedy.

673
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:41,780
I brought these cases to demonstrate, never mind how much verbally I may say wait.

674
01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:50,180
I bring these cases on long follow ups, I hope to show you some more, to see the effect.

675
01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:54,180
You will never believe and say but he is not doing well but he is doing well,

676
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:55,460
you have to perceive.

677
01:27:55,560 --> 01:27:59,680
The other day I said unless you perceive when a person is doing well, forget Homeopathy.

678
01:27:59,780 --> 01:28:01,420
You can't carry on with Homeopathy.

679
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:06,930
He is doing well. You have to perceive it. You have to understand it immediately.

680
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:10,270
He is doing well, don't touch it.

681
01:28:10,370 --> 01:28:17,690
It is like a beautiful painting.

682
01:28:19,940 --> 01:28:28,690
It is coming up so beautifully and then suddenly you take the brush and go like that,

683
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:33,950
not in harmony. The picture is gone.

684
01:28:36,190 --> 01:28:42,100
This is so sensitive, so apparent so vivid for me, that's how I perceive it.

685
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,760
Sometimes I have to do it.

686
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:51,510
With the Cicuta child they telephone, I see it is a serious situation,

687
01:28:51,610 --> 01:28:56,010
I don't have enough symptomatology and I'm not sure is this Sanicula, is this Bryonia

688
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:57,860
or is it another remedy?

689
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:03,020
What shall I do now? I keep them on the telephone and I know he is calling me

690
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:07,020
from Australia and it's going to cost him a lot of money and I try my best

691
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,030
and I give Sanicula and it doesn't work.

692
01:29:09,130 --> 01:29:15,690
That can spoil the case and I give Bryonia and I said if it doesn't work, he said it doesn't work.

693
01:29:15,790 --> 01:29:25,690
He calls me back and says the child is completely exhausted with fever over 40.

694
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:32,950
He gives me symptomatology and I said Belladonna, more clear now the picture.

695
01:29:33,050 --> 01:29:38,200
Next day he calls me, he is better, thank god but thank god it's not enough here

696
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:43,800
because after a week he may say the child cannot walk again

697
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,300
and you see how nice you feel after that.

698
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:58,380
Unfortunately you will say, if Homeopathy is so difficult, what shall we do? We try.

699
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:03,390
It is difficult, I never said it is easy.

700
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:11,220
But if we try, then we see beautiful things happening in the end.

701
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:12,930
We will see the beauty.

702
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:19,190
If we did it the wrong way, we will be so disappointed.

703
01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:31,280
I've seen even students of mine going astray. It's too long, I can't wait and they will get disappointed.

704
01:30:34,530 --> 01:30:36,780
Then they will come back and say, you are right.

705
01:30:39,530 --> 01:30:45,020
-George in a normal case, would you take homosexuality...

706
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:50,780
-In a normal case if I would take into consideration the pathology? Absolutely.

707
01:30:52,040 --> 01:30:54,420
Ah, the pathology homosexuality?

708
01:30:54,520 --> 01:31:01,920
You see with homosexuality we don't know the remedies that produce that turn,

709
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:05,770
neither the homosexuals accept that this is pathology.

710
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:13,170
Whether they accept or not it doesn't matter, still the remedy may change that

711
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:16,610
because I've seen several cases changing.

712
01:31:19,110 --> 01:31:27,500
So it is pathology for some cases. I've given my ideas about homosexuality.

713
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,510
I don't want to go into that now.

714
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:33,610
There are different groups of people, those that can change or they may never change.
