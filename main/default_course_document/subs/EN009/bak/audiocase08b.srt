1
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:27,900
-Do you have any clues so far?
-There is some thoughts.

2
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:50,160
-Do you have any ideas of the remedy?
-Arsenicum album.

3
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,820
-Staphysagria.
-Nat. muriaticum.

4
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,570
-Ignatia.
-Silica.

5
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:11,180
-Petroleum.
-Nat. carbonicum.

6
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,200
Let us see a little bit more of information.

7
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,500
-Just some thoughts.
-For very short time.

8
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,070
-The depression was what? You cried?

9
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:48,910
-Yes, this time I cried and I wrote all the story what has happened.

10
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:53,520
-You wrote it and you published the book?
-Yes, no!

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,420
You see the sensitivity? You see how automatic is the sensitivity?

12
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,660
Did you publish the book? She said yes. Why did I ask again?

13
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,270
Because I perceive she is answering without hearing.

14
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,590
I perceived immediately she did not hear what I asked.

15
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,480
That is how automatic should be your sensitivity, understanding the other person.

16
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,590
Almost reading their minds.

17
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,570
Sometimes some of you have seen some of this kind and you say, George is reading the mind.

18
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:41,780
It is not reading the mind, it is pure sensitivity and logic put together.

19
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,810
I'm not intuitive and illogical. I put logic and sensitivity together with perception.

20
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:56,320
I put these elements together and each one of us has to develop these elements.

21
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:03,310
How? By observing, by listening to others and not to your mind, listening to the person

22
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:11,560
and not to your own ideas inside. It is Calcarea carbonica, it is Causticum, it is this...

23
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:20,160
Forget it. The idea came, it is maybe Causticum. Wait and we confirm it.

24
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,800
-No, only for me.

25
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,910
-For yourself only.
-Yes.

26
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:50,320
-Do you eat a lot of salt?
-No, little.

27
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,820
-You don't like salt?
-I do yes.

28
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,230
-You eat fruits?
-Yes.

29
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,570
-You like fruits?
-Yes.

30
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:09,970
You see these questions go to the mind where some of you went, Nat. mur., Ignatia.

31
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:19,560
I see the grief, there is around Nat mur, is this? And the answer unfortunately is not.

32
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:25,720
Do you eat fruits because Ignatia aversion to fruits many, many times and not only that.

33
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:30,970
It has other keynotes like perspiration in the face only.

34
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:36,550
I will try to get this information to confirm is this or that and then to proceed further

35
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,470
to see what is happening.

36
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,120


37
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:03,450
It's not a great desire for fruits but she eats fruits.

38
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,030
It's not a great desire but from time to time she eats fruits, there is no aversion.

39
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:17,120
-Maybe salt is bad for her.

40
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:27,760
-Do you think it's the type that will take into consideration the diet?

41
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:34,620
That's another thing immediately you see in this woman.

42
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,620
She will not take care of herself.

43
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:55,850
You remember she said she did not have sex but once.

44
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,000
Did she say that?
-Yes.

45
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,600
-With the first husband.

46
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:10,160
-Once only after three years when her skin was better.

47
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,760
Did she say that?
-No, it was reported.

48
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:29,930
-I don't like milk. Not at all from two years.

49
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:42,080
That information is important now, aversion milk, why? Because she volunteers that information

50
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:50,920
and then she confirms it by saying since childhood I do not like milk.

51
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,820
That's definite, there is no question about that.

52
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,420
We have a symptom on which we may rely.

53
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:18,850
-And if you take something which has milk inside?
-Yogurt, that's OK.

54
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:36,350
-Is anything else that you don't like?
-Yes, fat meat, pork.

55
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:56,080
You see how I make long pauses and she will not volunteer any information.

56
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:06,440
Every time I pause, she will keep quite. She will not volunteer any information.

57
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,090
Aversion pork and aversion fat, it points out to Pulsatilla and aversion milk

58
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:19,440
it might also be there but this is not a Pulsatilla case.

59
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:29,090
Why? Because she is not forwarding anything, she is not open at all.

60
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:34,590
You know the Pulsatilla she will forward information, she will tell things,

61
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:44,190
it's not holding back so much as the Natrums or as the Ignatias.

62
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,840
-Do you like the sun? Do you sit under the sun?

63
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:25,940
-I like the sun very much but since two years I cannot bear it.

64
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:43,330
Here it is terrible for me because of the sun. I always have hat and I have headache at once.

65
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:51,850
After a short time of sunshine I get headache and weakness.

66
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:03,740
In former times I liked the sun and it's the best for my health, for my skin.

67
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:15,090
-When it started this aversion to the sun?
-Two years ago all the things together.

68
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:39,490
Since two years she has become a medicine which is worse by the sun, aversion to milk

69
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:59,740
and she says aversion pork and fat, not since two years but it seems there is a point

70
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:08,190
where the remedy picture has changed due to the fact that she is so sensitive to the sun.

71
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,750
You see how sensitive she is? It is terrible here.

72
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,490
For how many of you it is terrible? You have to wear really a hat?

73
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:20,750
You can't go anytime in the sun? If you go in the sun, you feel exhausted?

74
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,570
You feel headaches?

75
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,820
So there is definitely an aggravation from the sun.

76
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:58,730
-Did they give you Nat. mur.?
-Yes, I had it in very small doses in 6X.

77
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,450
-Ignatia you got?
-Yes, I got.

78
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,700
-Low potency or high potency?
-Low.

79
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,450
This case cannot be touched by low potencies.

80
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:41,370
Even the right potency will not produce the deep changes that we want to produce in her.

81
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:48,510
And you see grief Ignatia, grief Nat mur but it doesn't work always.

82
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:52,770
It works sometimes, not always. Here she needs another remedy.

83
00:12:52,870 --> 00:13:00,270
Now you will tell me you are going to give Nat carbo and the picture has changed in two years

84
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:08,530
and you base your prescription on aversion milk, which is since she was two years old.

85
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:15,270
How do you tell us or how do we believe that the remedy changed two years ago

86
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:22,020
and she went into Nat carbo since the aversion for milk is from young age?

87
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,690
She could tolerate the sun by that time, now she cannot tolerate the sun.

88
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:35,040
Is in that a contradiction, yes or no? Why didn't you ask me?

89
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:45,800
-As she is proceeding there are more and more symptoms.

90
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:55,740
-Yes but it's a logical question to ask and I like to hear these questions.

91
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,570
To say wait a moment and I let enough time to pass so somebody could ask me.

92
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,830
Do you understand the question?

93
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:17,800
Why are you saying this is a case of Nat carbo and she, because she is having aversion to milk

94
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:25,800
but she says the sensitivity to the sun, which is Nat carbo, came only two years ago.

95
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,300
What might have happened? What is the answer?

96
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:37,140
-She got the wrong remedy.

97
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:42,300
-If she got the wrong remedy, it will do two things.

98
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,210
Either it will bring a few symptoms for a time of her own and then it disappears

99
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:53,890
or it pushes the disease deeper but makes a clearer picture.

100
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,790
You have a case of Ferrum and you give Pulsatilla

101
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:05,240
and you see more strong symptoms of Ferrum eventually.

102
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,930
Then a headache starts with the Ferrum.

103
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:20,110
The answer here can be, and you have to remember that very well as a general remark,

104
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:30,350
that a symptom could continue under 2 or even 3 remedies.

105
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:44,590
That means aversion to milk might have been with another remedy, Lac defloratum

106
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:50,340
which is feeling the cold very much, likes the sun very much and has aversion to milk.

107
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:57,660
When from Lac defloratum changes into Natrum carbonicum, then certain symptoms

108
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:04,840
of her change towards Natrum carbonicum but one symptom remain, which is common to both.

109
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:14,740
So you may still need a second remedy for her, which will have aversion to milk

110
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,340
but perhaps of another intensity.

111
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,750
She may needs some Sepia later on which it has aversion to milk,

112
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,990
she may need some Calcarea carbonica, which has aversion to milk also, she may have been

113
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:34,490
Calcarea carbonica as a child, aversion to milk, coughing, worse cold, perspiration.

114
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:42,490
Or now from Calc carbo to Nat carbo, still aversion to milk but stronger now.

115
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:48,990
If we had a way to measure these symptoms we would see that now the symptom

116
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:57,480
because it is stronger in that remedy, it is stronger in her as well, very strong aversion to milk.

117
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,430
This is the same thing when a person says...

118
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,330
How are you? You call him after the first interview, he has come for headaches

119
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:19,090
and you say how are you? I still have my headaches he says.

120
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:23,330
When I hear that I don't write he still has his headaches, what else?

121
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:32,410
No, what I want to know is how strongly is. The same, as strong as before.

122
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:38,260
Still I want to know how frequently he has them.

123
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,250
And there it comes the answer, which you usually will hear, if you have given the right remedy,

124
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:48,990
you will hear I used to have headaches every second day.

125
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:55,640
Now? Now the last two weeks I didn't get. I just got two headaches.

126
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,890
Strong? Strong as before but one headache in a week from every second day.

127
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:06,890
The amelioration is therefore 70%.

128
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,390
If you wait, it will go up to 100%.

129
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:16,380
What she says, what she relates to you is that yesterday I still had one headache.

130
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,150
Yes one headache but what kind of headache?

131
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:28,470
Unless you perceive this, you can't proceed with Homeopathy.

132
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:36,490
This is so important, I cannot stress it enough.

133
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,630
It comes the Stramonium child and it says, the aggression is better thank you very much.

134
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:49,880
Ok, placebo, placebo, placebo. Everything will go away but just give placebo,

135
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,490
don't give other remedies.

136
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:58,150
The Causticum comes and says, I have more appetite,

137
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:06,060
I picked up weight and my energy is good, still I have the pains. Placebo, you wait.

138
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:17,640
I will give you some examples in this seminar, I have to give you some examples of waiting.

139
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:25,390
Already I have given you enough but I will give you more to see what I mean when I say

140
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,610
waiting and you will see in the end you will have a cured person.

141
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,440
In the end you will have somebody who is cured.

142
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:38,980
If you don't do that, in the end you will have somebody who always suffers.

143
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,660
Let's see for her what shall we do.

144
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,160
-You get a cold easily?
-Very easily yes, little fever.

145
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:31,810
One could make also seeing sighing, why don't you take into consideration sighing in this case?

146
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:40,560
Sighing but not enough to over throw the worse sun, exhaustion from the sun,

147
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:47,880
headache from the sun, aversion milk. The sighing is not tremendous.

148
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,820
If you would see that on the video...

149
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:05,980
I would say wait a moment, it is too strong the symptom. Forget about the sun.

150
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Now I say forget about the sighing, the sighing is not going to be the decisive factor.

151
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,410
-2-3 times the month.

152
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:35,560
-Are you afraid by thunderstorm at all?
-Not very much.

153
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,800
-Do you have any fears?
-Yes a lot.

154
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,050
-What fears?

155
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:12,730
-Fear of falling from the staircases, rolling stairs.

156
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:21,890
-It's a fear to step on them because you don't feel secure if you have vertigo?

157
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,800
-Yes and anytime.

158
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,800
-Another fear?

159
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:25,380
Did you understand? She has vertigo when she goes into the circus where the children play

160
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:34,930
and they go into something that they go around like that or up and down.

161
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,670
-The escalator?

162
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:44,220
-Not the escalator, it is on the circus when they play "Mary goes round".

163
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:42,590
-Also a kind of claustrophobia in the rooms and crowded, more in small rooms if the door are shut.

164
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:52,050
-So you didn't describe to me yourself. What kind of person you are?

165
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,650
You said you are a person without self-confidence.

166
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:18,300
-Small self-confidence but more than in earlier years.

167
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:25,550
-Now you do not have so much fear of self-confidence?

168
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:30,480
You have more self-confidence now?
-Yes.

169
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,130
-Do you feel happy inside?

170
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:48,630
-No because of my physical problems, they are too much.

171
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,140
-What is mostly bothering now?

172
00:25:51,240 --> 00:26:07,980
-The headaches, the infections and a sensitivity of my stomach.

173
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:31,970
What do we have here? We have a picture of Nat carbo more confined, why?

174
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:37,310
Because Nat carbo almost always has some problems with the stomach.

175
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:42,320
The stomach in Nat carbo is the weak spot.

176
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,570
Whatever it happens it affects the stomach.

177
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,470
-Fear of driving.

178
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:06,130
-I don't see in Nat carbo this, I don't know whether they have fear in escalators.

179
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:11,380
We just hear it now. If it goes away, then we wait to see if that fear goes away,

180
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:19,130
then we noted it down and then we may see, like fear in the" Mary goes around".

181
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:28,790
That is very much Cocculus, Argentum nitricum, Petroleum, Tabacum, remedies of that type

182
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,310
but not Natrum carbonicum so much.

183
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:38,890
So we wait to see what happens and how many symptoms of this patient will go away.

184
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:44,380
But what do you observe? You observe the closeness.

185
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,380
She searches what to say, she does not know what to say.

186
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,120
The self- importance is minimized.

187
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:11,870
If you ask me what do I think about myself... I'm the greatest homeopath!

188
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,530
Do you believe that? You don't believe it but it doesn't matter.

189
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:24,280
What it matters is how I feel. I feel very self-important, so I will tell you everything,

190
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,450
all my good points.

191
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:32,300
How sensitive, how nice, how loving etc.

192
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,040
Come on George.

193
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:52,050
A Natrum muriaticum that may have all these qualities after all and will say, what am I?

194
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,800
It is a difference, it is not accidental what you see.

195
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:12,940
We will see that later on when she will say for three years I did not dare to have sex

196
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,470
with my husband because my skin condition was so bad.

197
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:24,110
Once the skin condition for some time went better, she dared, she allowed herself

198
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,410
to have sexual intercourse with her husband.

199
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:47,280
How much concern about the other person that he will not get repulsed.

200
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,300
It is interesting to hear the whole story.

201
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:14,560
-What do you have there? Pains or discomfort?
-A discomfort and a little pain.

202
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:21,700
-It's all the time or after three hours after eating it starts?

203
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:38,050
-It's only if I eat the wrong things, too sharp or too fat.

204
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:53,220
I think my pancreas is not working right, I have feeling of low sugar.

205
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:58,370
-Do you desire sugar?
-I start trembling.

206
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,780
-If you eat sugar, it calms down?

207
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:11,630
-It is a little better if I eat sugar but not completely.

208
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:22,140
-Hypoglycemia.
-A little bit.

209
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:28,670
-So you have to eat something. Do you want to eat something during the interview?

210
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:31,220
-No, no.

211
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,360
-What kind of weather do you like? Do you like cold or warm weather?

212
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:03,040
-At the moment I like cold weather better.

213
00:32:53,290 --> 00:33:00,700
Skin has gone very bad these days of my travel to Greece.

214
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,700
-Because it's hot? It's too much sun?

215
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:19,460
-I couldn't bear the sun because of the headache and I missed the light therapy at home.

216
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:22,020
-Ultra violet?
-Yes.

217
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:40,920
-So what type of person you are? Discribe.
- i did.

218
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:52,920
-Not enough.
-I don't know where to start.

219
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:59,430
-Tell everything, everything that comes first in your mind.

220
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:24,250
-I think I don't live my natural character because I'm always handicap by my physic.

221
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:31,080
-I know but how do you feel?

222
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:35,410
Did you see the answer? How do you feel, what is your character?

223
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:42,190
Instead of describing the character, she automatically avoids...

224
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:47,530
Never mind how much you try. You see the resistance, it is very difficult to open up,

225
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,640
especially under the circumstances.

226
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:16,120
-How do you feel inside? Just describe to me.
-I feel good inside.

227
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:26,350
She still avoids the answer. If she says I feel good, there is no more questions.

228
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,950
The interrogation is going to finish.

229
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,470
She asks for help now.

230
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:53,200
-I'm content with my life at the moment. If I were healthy, I would say I'm happy now.

231
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,210
But what do you feel?

232
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,520
-Describe me this feeling, you said when you walk is like not stepping on the floor,

233
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:54,370
it is like flying, when you have the vertigo?
-It is like on a star.

234
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:06,700
-But you said as if you are not stepping on the floor.

235
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,840
-Yes.

236
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:35,450
-Do you get angry easily? Irritated?
-Yes.

237
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:42,040
-What do you do then? Do you come out with the anger or you withhold?

238
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,190
-I think I come out with the anger.

239
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:50,690
-You think. Are you sure?
-Yes.

240
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:56,540
-What do you do? Can you describe a case when last time you were angry?

241
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:24,450
-I'm impatient with the other person. I'm angry with my friend when he is very slow

242
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:34,300
and he doesn't understand me at once, I can be angry and impatient.

243
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:43,200
-Then what do you do?
-I tell him I'm angry.

244
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:55,040
-How?
-I try...

245
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:06,800
-She shouts.

246
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:27,190
Now this relationship that you have, you take some initiative or you follow what he wants?

247
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:32,210
-No, I have to take initiative.

248
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:44,210
-Is he the same age as you?
-Yes exactly.

249
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:50,960
-Do you feel that you protect him?

250
00:39:51,970 --> 00:40:11,380
-No but it's unusual for me to take initiative at all when I look at my before life.

251
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:24,290
It's new and it's not very easy sometimes for me.

252
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:43,450
-What it bothers you most at the moment is first the headaches and then the stomach

253
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,450
or the pains in the joints?

254
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:51,300
-The pains in the joints are good. No pain.

255
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:59,840
-Then the pain in the stomach is second and then the skin or the skin is second

256
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,780
or the skin is first?
-The skin is second.

257
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,880
-And the pain in the stomach is third or the exhaustion is?

258
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:25,270
-I think the infections, the frequent infections are.

259
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:36,270
-Where are the infections mostly?
-Colds, but also to the stomach.

260
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:42,260
-The stomach seems to have become very sensitive?

261
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:54,370
-It is like infection. It has diarrhea.

262
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:05,610
-When you get a cold usually it is with vomiting and diarrhea?

263
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:11,760
-Not usually but many times.

264
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:19,370
-Are you constipated?
-No.

265
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:26,150
-Your nails are strong?
-Yes, very strong.

266
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:42,370
-So you consider yourself open?
-Yes.

267
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:50,120
-Why you laugh?
-I think so.

268
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:54,260
-It's easy for you to talk to me?
-Yes.

269
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,480
-Do you think you have given me enough information?

270
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:04,780
-I hope so. In german it would be easier.

271
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,540
-Do you drink alcohol at all?
-Few and only beer.

272
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:29,960
-Does it aggravate your skin?
-Wine yes, beer not.

273
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,090
-Not at all. How much beer you can drink? One bottle?

274
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,080
-Yes.

275
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,260
-And you like to drink one whole bottle?

276
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:45,760
-Sometimes when it's hot here I drink it in the evening.

277
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:52,010
-Do you feel more happy when you drink the beer?
-No effect.

278
00:43:52,110 --> 00:44:16,010
-With your boyfriend are you talkative?
-Yes I would like but he is very silent.

279
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:26,360
-He is very close. No friends.
-Few.

280
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:39,870
-Do you have other friends?
-Yes but few. Some close friends.

281
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:25,620
-You don't talk much.
-Yes.

282
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:36,090
-Yes or you do?
-I have no idea.

283
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:52,240
-The menses are scanty, a small period, a bigger period, with a lot of blood?

284
00:45:52,340 --> 00:46:09,240
-A lot of blood and myomas.

285
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:13,850
-For how many days a lot of blood?
-5-6 days.

286
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:23,660
-Was any time when you had a bigger hemorrhage, like 10 days?

287
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,350
-Yes.

288
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:32,110
-Did they examine you? They found fibroma?
-Yes.

289
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,820
-A big one?

290
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:55,420
-Not so big, it's controlled and it hasn't grown and blood is still 5-6 days again.

291
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:13,420
-A bit of blood during ovulation sometimes.

292
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:42,570
-And the headache starts in two ways, before the menses and goes on the first part

293
00:47:42,670 --> 00:48:02,850
of the cycle to the ovulation that time. The second  part of the cycle was without headache,

294
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:06,460
this month and the month before.

295
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:18,700
-Do you have any leucorrhea?
-No.

296
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:55,450
-Do you perspire at all?
-Not very much.

297
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:12,450
-She has now flashes?
-Yes since two months.

298
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,550
-Flashes of heat?
-Yes.

299
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:24,630
-When did you take Pulsatilla?
-I don't know.

300
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:35,230
-She has some varicose veins now.
-Yes.

301
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:54,470
-The soles of the feet are sensitive?
-Not very much. Yes sensitive.

302
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,860
-What do you like to do? Do you work?
-Yes.

303
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:26,220
-What kind of work?
-In an office as a secretary. Arranging...

304
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:43,960
But only four hours the day, after that I'm very exhausted.

305
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:06,610
And I have much problems with my neck, I sit in the table and the neck

306
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:11,460
becomes stiff and painful.

307
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:25,690
-How is the sleep?

308
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:34,550
-At the moment it is good but sometimes ago I had much problems with my heart.

309
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:51,300
I slept and after an hour of sleeping I wake with very strong heart beating.

310
00:51:54,420 --> 00:52:02,940
Exactly an hour after sleep. All night.

311
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:10,820
-You mean you wake up after an hour and you stay awake the whole night or you sleep again?

312
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:22,250
-I sleep again and sometimes it comes back the heart beating and sometimes I sleep.

313
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:31,230
-Do you have a fright when you wake up?
-Yes terrible fright. Fright to death.

314
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:34,080
-That you will die?
-Yes.

315
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,850
-Every night?

316
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:52,250
-Yes a long time it was every night. At the moment it is not. Here it is not.

317
00:52:52,350 --> 00:53:09,050
-You will go to bed and after an hour you will wake up with palpitation and fear of death?

318
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:10,550
-Yes.

319
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:16,310
Can you find this symptom?

320
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:29,050
It's a very important symptom what she has said. Can you find it in the Repertory.

321
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:47,610
Palpitation on waking, waking from palpitations is close but this is much more strong.

322
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:52,210
She wakes up in a fright and she will scream.

323
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:04,710
She will say it later on.

324
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:13,130
Fear of death on waking in the night, do we have that symptom?

325
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:22,390
How do you know Aconite? Because it is in my lectures.

326
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:35,050
Fear of death on waking, Alumina.

327
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,950
-Excitement at night.

328
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:31,040
-Yes find me this. Where is Nat carb bold? Not bold.

329
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:47,440
It's interesting on this Repertory which has additions from different,

330
00:55:49,530 --> 00:56:02,690
it has a note that comes from Hahnemann and it says chest, palpitation, night, waking,

331
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:07,790
only Natrum carbonicum it gives for that and it comes from Hahnemann.

332
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:24,960
It's interesting just to find some confirmation on what you are thinking.

333
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:45,970
What she says lately also confirms the initial diagnosis.

334
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:58,690
I was especially pleased when I saw this addition in this Repertory from a note from Hahnemann.
