1
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:38,060
-The last 4 months since my last follow up here, I most of the time had the feeling as

2
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:54,810
if I was not recovering from a severe illness. I'd like to describe some physical complains.

3
00:00:54,910 --> 00:01:02,310
This time was characterized by recurrent pains in my legs of different kinds which I will

4
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,060
explain further in a short while.

5
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:15,730
Twice I had states with extremely painful cramps in my calves during the night, very bad.

6
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:21,480
These two nights when it's occurred, I tried to get up and walk around.

7
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,740
Every once in a while I used to have cramps in my calves before and then

8
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,980
helped me to get up and walk.

9
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,730
But this time with this incident now, the pain was so severe that I was not able to get

10
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:47,640
out of bed and my leg was drawn together in the knee joint; I needed 5-10 min. of

11
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,390
massaging my muscles to ease...

12
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,390
-You were shouting?
-Yes, yes.

13
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,560
And after that I managed to finally get up and walk around and then the pain

14
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,230
subsided and this happened twice.

15
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:11,730
I noticed that quite regularly I have cramps in my calves when I take off my gardening boots.

16
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:16,730
I work in the garden a lot and wear high rubber boots and every time I take the off

17
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,150
I have a cramp.

18
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,140
Now I'd like to say something about the pains in my legs.

19
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,310
Every time I had a lot of physical exertion, these pains developed over night into the

20
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:37,060
next day and they were stitching and cutting pains that I could not get out of bed the

21
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:44,010
next morning. And any movement aggravated.

22
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:53,140
Just quietly lying there ameliorated and almost always my right leg which was affected

23
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,650
and the central area of the pain was mainly in my hip, in my upper leg, in my thigh

24
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,130
and the quality was cutting and tearing and stitching.

25
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:11,300
And these pains I had in my hip and in my thigh extended downwards into my lower

26
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,550
limb all the way down to my ankles.

27
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,050
The first time these pains appeared was about the mid of June and it occurred after

28
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:25,550
I carried some very heavy stones but I'm absolutely positive that I did not twist anything

29
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:32,800
or have any torsion or something. It was just a muscular problem due to over exertion.

30
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:43,550
I then took vitamin B12 in high doses. I had an amelioration after 2 days with it and after

31
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,600
a total time of 14 days, the pain subsided.

32
00:03:49,700 --> 00:04:17,850
-How much high is the dose of vitamin B?
-About 600-1000 mm. per day.

33
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:24,600
This incident repeated itself another 2 times. The last time was about 5 weeks before

34
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,350
I came to Alonissos this time.

35
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,350
-While he was taking the vitamin?

36
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,100
-No, I had stopped taking the vitamin after it got better and then when it happened

37
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,050
again I took them again but they hardly had any effect.

38
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,270
Then I turned to taking vitamin B6 and Magnesium and that made the pain barely

39
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:52,770
tolerable but I had the pains the entire time, these past 5 weeks.

40
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:59,270
I arrived here on the island with pain. I was able to walk but I constantly had some

41
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:06,270
kind of pain. Yesterday the pains had aggravated severely, I could not walk anymore

42
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,770
so I decided to stay at home in the afternoon and lie down.

43
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,520
Because lying stretched out on my bed, that ameliorates.

44
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:25,020
-The pain you are talking about is on the right leg, starting from the hip joint, going down?

45
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:32,760
-Yes but the center of the pain is in the middle of my thigh.

46
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:43,510
And I also have the feeling of a sore pain in the middle of the bone of my thigh.

47
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,520
-It means inside the bone?

48
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:58,270
-Inside the bone. And then I had a kind of intuition. I had cold feet, since long time

49
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,770
I didn't have that anymore. In the last times they turned colder again and so yesterday

50
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:10,510
I decided to put on shocks in bed and miraculously enough over night the pains

51
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:18,510
ameliorated quite a lot and so today I'm able to walk again and come up, here.

52
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,010
-Very interesting for the next remedy which is developing.

53
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:32,010
-Another complain which is already existing since 1 1/2 years but I think I never really

54
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:38,430
mentioned it in this intensity here in the follow ups is that I have bleeding of my gums.

55
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:45,200
It's started the moment I stopped smoking. Since then I suffer from it.

56
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:56,300
-How many years ago?
-1 and 1/2 years ago he stopped smoking.

57
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:07,450
They bleed immediately when I brush my teeth and also already after slight touch.

58
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,960
What I also had once was something I had had before in former times already

59
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:27,390
a short, very intense, burning pain behind my sternum, almost like cold, hot cold.

60
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:45,210
And for a short while it just takes my breath.
-This pain how long ago he had it?

61
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:55,460
-It started when I started homeopathic treatment here and it just reoccurs on and off

62
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,210
every once in a while I have it.

63
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,460
-He did not have it before homeopathic treatment here?

64
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:08,460
-Not this kind. I had had a pressure behind my sternum but never this intense pain

65
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,210
with such a burning quality.

66
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,960
-How long it lasts this and how frequent? One minute?

67
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,960
-It lasts one minute and it occurred twice in this time.

68
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:27,460
Then I noticed that these last weeks I feel an urge, a need to stretch in the morning

69
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,210
after waking and that does me very good.

70
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:40,710
I would like to say something now about my mental-emotional situation.

71
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:56,460
Strong slowness overwhelmed me. I'm very slow. I now feel the need to slowly and

72
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:07,710
thoroughly incorporate my knowledge, whereas in former times I was interested one time

73
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:14,210
in this more and on that and I was not so concentrated, not so focused on the subject

74
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:25,960
of my studies.

75
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:34,210
And I became extremely sensitive to cruelty. Before I could watch some movies, some

76
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:40,460
criminal movies and now I can not watch anything of that kind anymore, I can not take

77
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,960
watching anything with any hint of cruelty in it.

78
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:53,710
Concerning my fears I noticed that I have a special fear of insects, if I see a bug crawling

79
00:09:53,810 --> 00:10:00,460
on the ground I always shudder and I'm also afraid of spiders.

80
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,710
I don't kill them anymore, that has become impossible for me to do but I really make

81
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:13,130
sure that I remove them from my room or from my house in any possible manner.

82
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:20,290
Right now I feel I would not be able to work as emergency doctor, taking care of the

83
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:26,790
wounds of people who have been in accidents, just having a clear mind and doing what

84
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:32,290
is necessary; right now it would not be possible for me at all.

85
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:40,040
I also noticed great difficulty to write down my thoughts on paper. The thoughts are good

86
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:45,540
but I can't put them down. If I want to sit down and write them down, at that moment

87
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,790
there is a kind of blockage, I just can't write them and I don't know why.

88
00:10:51,890 --> 00:11:01,040
What I still have is the aggravation in the morning. These states of anxiety or sadness

89
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,540
or any kind of unpleasant emotional things are always come over me in the morning

90
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,990
while I'm awakening.

91
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:14,460
There is another thing which I think I have not mentioned until now, I can not tolerate

92
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,210
tight clothing nowhere.

93
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:31,760
But in spite of my slowness, which I have accepted in the meantime, I feel hopeful and  optimistic.

94
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:40,260
-I want to ask some questions. Originally he had mentioned a vertigo from high places.

95
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,010
Has he checked this out?

96
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:56,930
-I go on top of my roof because I have to but I don't feel well at all when I do that.

97
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:08,680
-The last interview he was mentioning about a lumbar region pain when standing.

98
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,100
He did not mention that pain now. It was not noticeable?

99
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:27,600
-It's true, I have the feeling that this pain in my back somehow moved into my legs.

100
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:33,850
-Last time he said there is a sore pain in the mouth, now he says bleeding.

101
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:45,140
-No, I do not have that anymore.
-In his dreams there is any particular form, issues?

102
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:53,140
-I had had two dreams which had to do with violence.

103
00:12:53,240 --> 00:13:00,150
-I asked this because last time he mentioned dreams of accusation, that he was accused.

104
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:17,270
it did not repeat and I think because I closed the issue 'father' with the dream. I finished it.

105
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:31,960
-Also I would like him to tell me, his feet are more cold but in general he is feeling more the cold now?

106
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:38,220
-I think in general I have become a bit more colder. It's not so that I'm really cold.

107
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,470
I still have heat every now and then but I noticed that when I'm swimming here, before

108
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:50,720
it used to be a lot too warm, the water was too warm for me and now it's like a pleasant

109
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,790
coolness; so in general I would say yes I have become colder than what I was before.

110
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:04,950
-But in his feet definitely?
-I don't uncover them anymore.

111
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:14,920
-Also concerning his desires and aversions, has any change there?

112
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:26,340
-I now have a special aversion against milk, which before was not as strong as now.

113
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,590
And I still like to eat meat.
-What about sweets?

114
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:37,870
-I like to eat them but it's not I don't have to have them.

115
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,310
-The aversion buttermilk is still there?

116
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:51,480
-Yes but now not only buttermilk but also aversion to milk.

117
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,980
-And eggs?
-I like eggs a lot.

118
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,480
-More than before, the same as before?

119
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,980
-Actually I always like to eat eggs and still like to eat eggs. I also like hard boiled eggs

120
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:09,650
but there is a funny thing about it. My inner feeling says that the cholesterol of the eggs

121
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:30,240
is good for me but mentally I restrain myself from eating them.

122
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:37,600
-What about the herpes he had in his lips, the last time he was reporting.

123
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,600
Did not appear anymore?
-It did not reappear up to now.

124
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:49,370
-Also he had complained last time about sexual desire going down or not having.

125
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:53,290
The way I feel now mentally is that I'm slow but I'm thorough and very nit, very orderly.

126
00:15:53,390 --> 00:16:01,240
-It's still quite low but for me I think it has to do with this general state of slowness

127
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:12,490
of sluggishness and this inner feeling of being in a recovery phase, which is not progressing though.

128
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,330
-OK, thank you.

129
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:42,420
-It is very interesting. We don't have to say very much about the case. Not really.

130
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:55,420
Why? Because we have a remedy which is appearing and rather clearly.

131
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:11,510
The changes are such that indicate the direction quite clearly.

132
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:23,910
Also it is interesting for us -and don't forget this issue - that certain desires eggs

133
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,160
always was there. You see what was happening?

134
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:39,120
If you take the case desires eggs, yes desires eggs can be manifesting in your first prescription.

135
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:45,120
-When he took Sulphur he was still in desires eggs.

136
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:53,120
-He took Sulphur when we know Sulphur has aversion eggs, he doesn't like them.

137
00:17:53,220 --> 00:18:02,370
The vertigo high places was from Ignatia, was Sulphur, it did not go away with Sulphur.

138
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:11,030
It's waiting for another layer.

139
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:25,480
And then this going down towards ... indicates the correct direction and at the same time

140
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:31,200
points out to a great keynote of Calcarea carbonica.

141
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:45,700
Cramps in the night in the calves.

142
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:58,620
Aversion milk also. It is very interesting that the organism knows what wants and what

143
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,280
does not want, as far as microelements is concerned and vitamins, to take it from

144
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,700
different food.

145
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,700
So when he wants something from a food, then asks for that food.

146
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:24,950
That's why it is important for us to take into consideration the desires and aversions.

147
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:35,700
The very interesting thing that he says is that when he puts the socks, he is ameliorated

148
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:46,120
and shows how correct is our observation for Calcarea carbonica, putting shocks.

149
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:51,620
Calcarea carbonica has to put shocks in order to be able to sleep.

150
00:19:51,720 --> 00:20:02,870
But sometimes this aggravation can reach up to the point of aggravating the pains.

151
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:09,620
The way he describes the whole slowness that we know from Calcarea carbonica.

152
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:18,150
How slow it is. But at the same time while he is slow, he is organized and is precise.

153
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:25,120
He is not scattered anymore.

154
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:34,620
From homeopathic point of view this is a beautiful case, where we have the Ignatia and

155
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,870
the Sulphur and the Calcarea carbonica.

156
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:48,620
And this state of Ignatia was there for 10 years.

157
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:56,530
That state it doesn't meant you have a grief and you have it for a period of time.

158
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:09,780
In some cases the Ignatia picture will remain for many years. You have to give it first.

159
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:20,690
If he had taken Sulphur without the Ignatia, then you could not see the effect.

160
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:29,940
You could not see the organism coming into order.

161
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:40,610
And I would like to ask have you taken Sulphur in the past?

162
00:21:40,710 --> 00:22:00,020
-Once, 6 years ago in 200.

163
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:15,270
-What is the potency now that must choose? Who is in favor of 12? Nobody.

164
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:57,530
30? 200? 1M? 10M? 50M?

165
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:10,020
We have mostly physical symptomatology and I think we can start with 200 and then

166
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,310
we will see if he needs higher potency.

167
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:27,520
-George, usually when the picture is so clear you go high in potency. Can you explain what happens?

168
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:43,520
-Yes. I said when there is a big trauma in the soul, then in order to touch this, you have

169
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:57,520
to go high. You remember when we gave Ignatia, we gave 50M to touch this traumatic

170
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:03,770
experiences he was going. Now we don't need to go so high anymore because the

171
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:16,690
symptomatology is physical and even 12 Calcarea carb., 6X every day will do the trick.

172
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:21,440
So one dose of 200 now it will act.

173
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,690
You remember the case yesterday with Calcarea phosphorica?

174
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:32,440
She said I got one dose of 12 and it acted and took it a few times up to 30.

175
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:38,930
When we voted she was the only one who said give 30 because her experience is

176
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:56,850
that 30 can do the trick very well.

177
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:04,350
-I wanted to ask because there is mental symptomatology, he is afraid of insects

178
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:09,890
he is afraid of spiders, he is slow. So it's not only physical, we have complete picture

179
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,640
with mental as well.

180
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:21,890
-Fear of insects, fear of spiders... no. What you can say is that the sensitivity towards

181
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:31,140
cruelty is very characteristic of Calcarea carb. You don't need to go higher.

182
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:43,180
This is not a trauma, this is a sensitivity. It is different than trauma.

183
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:51,140
Now he is a whole human being, he cares. The only thing is that he cares a little bit

184
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:59,890
too much now because of his lack of Calcium which is not absorbed so easily.

185
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:05,390
We are going to give the organism the possibility to absorb the calcium that he needs

186
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:11,390
and you will see how this will be balanced.

187
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:28,130
Now if he is going to become a cruel person? No but he will react more natural to pain.

188
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,280
Calc. carb. cannot stand cruelties, cannot see an accident.

189
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,950
He says I can not work, he said it very beautifully.

190
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:47,700
Everything he said is a picture of Calc. carb. in spite of the fact, I told you, you don't have

191
00:26:47,800 --> 00:27:05,960
to have the fat individual.

192
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:16,700
-The last time was Calc. carb. 200.
-Exactly.

193
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,210
-He can tell us what happened.

194
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:23,870
-I first want to describe the symptoms that have disappeared.

195
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:29,620
The first symptom which was there and which was the reason for me being treated

196
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,870
acutely was my sciatica on the right side, which after 3 weeks gradually and

197
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,620
very slowly disappeared.

198
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,120
The calves that I was describing having at night and when I was putting on my boots or

199
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:49,370
putting them off, they too disappeared for about 90%.

200
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:56,210
This wandering and burning pain in my thigh disappeared for 100%.

201
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,540
The pain in my left hip that would come up after a long walk or a hike that disappeared

202
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,790
for about 70%. This burning pain that I had underneath my sternum which had

203
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:21,790
appeared very strongly and severely about 3 times before I took the Calcarea

204
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,540
didn't come up again.

205
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:31,710
In the headline of my symptoms which were called the feeling of 'an inner enemy

206
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:41,700
my vulnerability and my weakness' the first one had disappeared.

207
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,700
I may now describe the symptoms that remained. On the first place I have the

208
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:52,450
massive bleeding of my gums that always occurs when I'm brushing my teeth which

209
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,450
now goes on for 2 years.

210
00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:01,150
The pain on my neck on the left side is a little bit reduced but it's still there.

211
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:11,900
It's in combination and in connection with the sensibility to cold drafts and my desire for scarf...

212
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,150
-That means there is a sensitivity to this area to draft and he has to wear a scarf.

213
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:23,100
-If it's cold. I would even say that my inner temperature is dominated by the

214
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,080
temperature that I feel in my neck.

215
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:32,080
My feeling of numbness on the outer side of my right leg is still there.

216
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:49,080
My nails are pretty brittle. They have lines and one nail is still split in the middle.

217
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,330
My waking up in the morning between 4-5 o' clock is still existing.

218
00:29:54,430 --> 00:30:01,710
Later on I'm going to add something in this symptom when I'm talking about mymental symptoms.

219
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:08,700
My sexual desire for the time being went very low. I rather feel a desire for physical

220
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,450
touch, for caressing.

221
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:30,750
And if at all my sexual desire is combined with this desire for touch and for feeling love.

222
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,820
Then I want to mention something that I didn't stretch last time that I have extensive

223
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,820
desire for hot drinks.

224
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:46,770
Now I come to mention the emotional and mind symptoms.

225
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:52,490
Concerning the 3 main topics that I had, my vulnerability is still existing.

226
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,030
-To cruelty?

227
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:06,520
-Yes, a sensibility towards cruelty and a feeling of being unprotected.

228
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:12,770
I have now the impression of being in this phase of my life of my childhood when I was

229
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:15,280
between 3-4 years.

230
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:22,270
-He means emotionally? In that vulnerable state?

231
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:30,190
-Yes, mainly because I had to live for months with closed eyes on both sides.

232
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:36,440
My eyes were wrapped up at this time.

233
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:45,440
That was at that time a therapy against strabismus. That means on the road, when I

234
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:51,220
was eating, everywhere I would just have darkness in front of my eyes for months.

235
00:31:51,320 --> 00:32:00,440
I was not allowed to take off these bindings and I was threatened to be punished

236
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:06,690
heavily if I would take off these eye covers.

237
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:23,440
I think this in now the moment, the phase of a pronounced inner discourage.

238
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:29,440
And this is a strong opposition to the phase between 30-50 where professionally

239
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:37,190
would meet any decision directly with a lot of courage.

240
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:42,190
This is the one topic and the other topic has to do with the dream that I'm now

241
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,070
 going to tell you.

242
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:51,520
I was together with a number of other people on a flight across a small trail

243
00:32:51,620 --> 00:33:00,520
in the mountains and a big rock was just pending above us and I was standing

244
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:07,520
underneath this rock and all the other people would pass through this rock and when

245
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:20,050
the last one had passed, I couldn't keep the stone any longer and I would fall down.

246
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:25,060
That is the second topic that I'm feeling, I have the impression that I have to do

247
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:33,280
something for myself not to be lost.

248
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:44,020
-He was hurt when the rock and he fell, his impression was that he was hurt by this?

249
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:48,770
-I wouldn't be able to tell you because I woke up in the moment that I and the rock

250
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:57,520
were falling, I woke up. And determining for my life so far has been that the positive

251
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:08,930
results for my creativity and my power mostly were helpful for other people.

252
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:14,630
And so my life had been determined by the emotion of people around me.

253
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,740
And this as a special symptom has as a result that every morning I would wake up

254
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,040
between 4,30-5 o'clock full of worries and sorrows what is going to be there waiting

255
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:35,170
for me to be a 100% able to meet those demands.

256
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:50,090
more irritable, which of course I would withhold to the outside.

257
00:34:52,340 --> 00:35:01,490
This is due the cause for me having to check everything to the door of my flat, the

258
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:07,480
door of the cellar, the door of my car, if anything had been with the car I had nearly

259
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,480
compulsory to check it.

260
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:16,490
Even though I would rather like to let everything just open.

261
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,240
-When he says to check he means to lock?

262
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:28,020
-No, I'm just going to check if it is already locked. I just go there to the cellar...

263
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:33,230
-Yes but he would like to leave it open.

264
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:38,950
-Actually I'd rather like to have it all open. But I can't leave my computer and all the

265
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:45,680
data of my patients open and reachable for everybody.

266
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:49,150
I think these are the main things.

267
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:54,150
-I would like to ask some questions. First of all I would like to know if there is still

268
00:35:54,250 --> 00:36:00,070
the desire to stretch in the morning?

269
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:08,570
-That is still there.

270
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:31,520
-He was complaining last time that his mind is slow, he says I can not write down my thoughts?

271
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,270
-Yes, that is still there.
-The same as before?

272
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:47,870
-I think it is the same but by the fact that the two other mind symptoms, that I've just

273
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:58,540
been describing, it has been increased.

274
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,540
I have the impression that by this feeling my ability to concentrate is even more

275
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,790
diminished for the time being.

276
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,180
-Which feeling?

277
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,680
-By these thoughts that permanently circulate in me about these problems that I've

278
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:20,180
just been describing, this dream, this problem with my childhood and this problem with

279
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,430
the closed eyes, that I just described.

280
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:33,430
-I want to understand what exactly means. This vulnerability, he says there is a kind

281
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:43,180
of vulnerability which comes from this period of his life. What is exactly the feeling?

282
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:53,930
The feeling is fear, the feeling is anxiety, what is that which comes from that experience?

283
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,180
-It's the permanent feeling of apprehension.

284
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:11,180
-And the desire to be protected like a child who is unprotected?

285
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:19,680
-No, no that's not the case. This is not it.

286
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:30,180
It's just the apprehensions that have built up by this.

287
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:36,220
-Another is aversion to milk, still is there?
-Yes.

288
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:46,070
-And the desire for eggs?
-Maybe not as strong as before.

289
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,630
-What about the vertigo high places?

290
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,540
My desire for meat has stayed the same.

291
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,150
-What kind of meat?
-Mostly beef.

292
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,660
-Fear insects, spiders he has mentioned.

293
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:30,410
-It's still there but it is better. I try to make an agreement with these creatures.

294
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:44,560
-Would he say he is physically restless?
-Actually not.

295
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:50,360
-In bed he sleeps quietly or he turns?

296
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:56,200
-My wife says that in bed sometimes I'm really hitting about.

297
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,700
-He is restless during sleep.
-Yes but I don't realize myself.

298
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:11,700
-Does he realize that perhaps he is restless in his legs or feet or anything like that?

299
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,120
Do you have any constipation or stool is normal?

300
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,400
-I feel quite uneasy when I don't have stool, which might occur here and then.

301
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:28,400
I'm always very relieved after having had stool.

302
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:48,570
-Is this a kind of joy when he has a stool?
-No, he wouldn't be able to say that.

303
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:54,330
-Every morning wakes up at 4-5 with anxiety?

304
00:40:54,430 --> 00:41:07,320
-Every morning yes, waking up with apprehension, not anxiety.

305
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:23,740
-I want really to stress that I'm not afraid of life, I'm not afraid of my every day life.

306
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,770
It just these apprehensions.

307
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:29,840
-Which are abstract?
-It's a permanent worry about other people.

308
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:38,860
-Mostly patients?
-Not only patients, other people too.

309
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,110
-Friends, relatives?
-Yes.

310
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,360
-Anxiety about other people.

311
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,860
-I want to mention something briefly. I don't have the feeling that my organism

312
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,860
desires a new remedy for the time being. I rather have the feeling that it is my own task

313
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,610
to work through the things that I experience that happen to me and maybe then it would

314
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:08,860
be possible to have even a clearer picture.

315
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,360
-Yes I see here from the repertorization that Calc. carb. is still standing quite high.

316
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:24,610
Most probably if there is a relapse on the physical symptomatology, he can repeat

317
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,140
the remedy in the same potency 200.

318
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:37,390
But there is a possibility that later Rhus tox will be indicated, especially if the organism

319
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,890
starts to desire milk.

320
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:46,300
Perhaps after 1-2 doses more of Cal. carb. there is a possibility that Rhus tox

321
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,550
complement the action.

322
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:58,470
It's very interesting also for me that his organism has gone back to this state where

323
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:10,470
the origin of the problems is. He is able to see, to feel this condition and to deal with that.

324
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:18,440
We agree we don't give him any remedy but, as I said, the possibilities are these and

325
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,230
maybe if we meet after 1 year...
