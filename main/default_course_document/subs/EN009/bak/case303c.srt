1
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,590
-In May she got the Causticum C200 every day and in addition to this

2
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:48,010
she had the cortisone enemas with 2.5 mg and after this everything

3
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:50,360
was completely normal.

4
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:57,930
-When she came here originally she was taking how much cortisone

5
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:00,690
and how much enema?

6
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,850
-10 mg of cortisone and one enema per day.

7
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:17,100
-One enema of cortisone as well together with ...

8
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,410
-... with 2.5 mg of cortisone.

9
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,430
-And what else?

10
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:35,370
-It was just cortisone in the enema and the 10 mg of cortisone she left out

11
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,440
during the time she was on the island in May.

12
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:49,360
On the journey home she had one diarrhea after eating sour food and within five weeks

13
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:56,430
 when she was at home, she would gradually stopped taking cortisone enemas.

14
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:03,070
One week after stopping the enemas the stool started to get thinner again

15
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,100
and had blood in it.

16
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:14,910
In addition to this I got stitching pains in my abdomen again in the left side

17
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:23,240
and rumbling and flatulence and the pain got ameliorated by passing of the bloatedness,

18
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:31,990
the flatulence and after this I should take the Causticum 1M on a daily basis,

19
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,920
nevertheless it got worse and worse.

20
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,740
I had about 20 times stool the day and increasing amount of blood.

21
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:51,500
-Let me read a little bit of the report which I received through the fax at this moment.

22
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:59,660
She stopped taking cortisone last weekend. Since three days it got more and more diarrhea,

23
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,920
the pain is much more worse, she could not hold it on.

24
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,490
Also the diarrhea is much more worse, she must go to the toilet 10-20 times the day

25
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:21,900
always with blood and pieces of mucus. The blood is dark and it gets more and more.

26
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,070
She took Causticum but it got worse, yes continue.

27
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:35,900
-The back aches came back under the right shoulder plate and extending to both sides.

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,080
During this time I was in very bad mood, permanently tired and had nearly no energy.

29
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,060
The skin eruption from Alonissos didn't get better;

30
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,590
this double checking was getting better but still there was a little bit

31
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:59,330
and home in Germany I was having throat pains, sensation as if there was something

32
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,080
stuck in my throat, no pains at night.

33
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,730
Then there were eczemas behind the ears, what I had in former times on my hands,

34
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,250
on my arms and on my legs.

35
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:20,520
This time was itching very much and I had to scratch so long till the crust was going off,

36
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:24,660
it was bleeding. Trembling was going on too.

37
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,320
And the warmer it got, the more trembling.

38
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:43,660
And after this I was told to take Mercury corrosivus C200, 3 times per day.

39
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:54,710
Nevertheless there was no amelioration and with the passing stool, the pain came on.

40
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,470
With the urge to stool already, this pain came on.

41
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,390
When I was leaning forward I was pressing this spot and the pain was getting better.

42
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Otherwise it was a cramping pain and it was stitching as if a knife was going near

43
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:20,640
and the pain would come up suddenly and only faded away gradually after passing stool.

44
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,610
I had no problems during the night concerning stool.

45
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:30,980
Only the last stool of the day before the night would come, was most painful.

46
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:40,370
The next day the fever would rise to 38.2, there was more blood and water in the stool.

47
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,070
On Saturday, the sixth day, the fever got less again.

48
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:50,450
During the night I had stool too but less and with blood in it

49
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,380
and on Sunday it was much worse again and after this weekend, I got a strict diet.

50
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:05,560
Only rice with a little bit of lemon juice and black tea.

51
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,730
On Monday I got Sulphur C200 and after this I got strong skin eruption,

52
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:19,060
as if I had fallen into urticaria.

53
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,720
It was terribly itching, especially at night lying in bed and after the sleep in the afternoon.

54
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,710
The amount of stool per day was getting less, only eight times per day.

55
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,040
It was formed stool.

56
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:41,210
-Also she forgot to mention that she developed thirst, quite strong thirst for cold water.

57
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,950
-During this time I was very hot in my face and at this spot on my abdomen;

58
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:53,850
otherwise I was freezing and in addition to this I got astronaut diet.

59
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,930
I don't know how you call it in English.

60
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:02,590
The skin eruption got better and stool was normalizing too till Thursday,

61
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:05,590
the second of the July.

62
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:16,180
On that day I had a car accident and on the place of the accident the diarrhea

63
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,920
and the trembling was getting worse.

64
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,350
-She forgot to say that she bought the car a few days before

65
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,930
and it was a terrible shock for her.

66
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:41,170
-Yes and I had a shock and later on I thought about what could have happened.

67
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,940
And the police took the accident, took the details of the accident,

68
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:51,840
my parents came to the place of the accident and brought me to Sabine and to her office.

69
00:07:51,940 --> 00:08:01,930
In the evening we called Greece and after this you gave me Aconite 1M

70
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,680
and on Friday next day the colitis was very bad again.

71
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,000
The course of accident was as bad as it had been before the homeopathic treatment

72
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,780
and in addition to this I got strong cramps in my calves.

73
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:22,640
In the evening I got Causticum 10M and in the night from Friday to Saturday

74
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,410
I was so bad that I didn't want to live anymore.

75
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:33,180
I couldn't walk anymore and on Saturday night I got Causticum CM.

76
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,640
Nevertheless it was gradually getting worse and worse.

77
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,890
It was continuously getting worse and worse and as the amount of stool was getting

78
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:46,560
more and more and the fever went up again.

79
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:52,730
And I've seen her during this time and her stage was getting so bad

80
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:58,230
that I was really getting scared that she was dying under my hands.

81
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:07,850
On Sunday I couldn't still walk and at noon I got Colocynthis C200 diluted in water.

82
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,610
-Colocynthis? I did not give this.

83
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:18,960
-No, I gave it to her because it was continuously developing.

84
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,450
-Actually you said you could not get me on the telephone, right?

85
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:30,190
-Yes, nevertheless she was getting worse faster and faster and we waited

86
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,030
till six in the evening.

87
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:39,440
Then I took Mercury corrosivus C200 and during the next hour I only had one stool.

88
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,470
After this I fell asleep.

89
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,970
For the first three hours I slept very restlessly and then I slept quite calmly

90
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,610
and in addition to this I took one enema of cortisone.

91
00:09:52,200 --> 00:10:01,260
On Monday I still couldn't walk and I was unable to go and see the doctor

92
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,440
and after this I took vegetables soup.

93
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:13,960
Within half an hour I could walk again and my appetite was coming back.

94
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,570
-But she didn't say, she was given cortisone but first she got cortisone

95
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,360
and then she got better? She was better before the cortisone?

96
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,540
-Much better.

97
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:33,870
It was all gone actually and the internal doctor gave her 15 ml of cortisone every day

98
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:40,120
but at that stage she was able again to walk and to go and see him.

99
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,860
On Monday the diarrhea and the pain was completely gone and on Monday they made

100
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:55,390
a blood sample and the indications for inflammation were very much up.

101
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,390
One was 1.70.

102
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,370
-Centimentation rate?

103
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:07,450
-Probably centimentation rate. There is an indication of inflammation.

104
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:11,030
-C reactive protein was high?

105
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:17,700
-Yes, it was over 70 and the internal doctor was insisting that I would take the 15 ml

106
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,710
of cortisone every day and after three days he was controlling the blood again.

107
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:28,870
And this inflammation indication it was gone down to 12 and so he went down

108
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:35,970
with the cortisone to 14 ml and at this week I still have to take 7.5 ml.

109
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:41,700
And from next week on, only 5 ml and the blood examination is completely OK

110
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,540
at the moment.

111
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:59,410
Already one week after this bad relapse the blood examination was completely OK.

112
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:11,050
At a certain time the internal doctor gave her injections of iron and vitamins.

113
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:26,840
-I just want to read from the report on the 30th of June.

114
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,520
She took Sulphur 200 in the night, a big skin eruption started,

115
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,210
12 hours after taking the remedy.

116
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:44,000
Most of the face and the neck but also on the whole body and the extremities.

117
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:57,100
Then she reports on 1st of July, two days later, the temperature is 37.8

118
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,180
and the skin eruption stays on, it's the same as yesterday.

119
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,770
It's more worse after sleeping in the afternoon.

120
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,480
The itching is terrible, the skin eruption behind the ears stays on.

121
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:18,360
After this starting of the cortisone I did not have anymore reports.

122
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,870
-She is feeling well all the time.

123
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:34,610
-My problem was the fact that she was given so much cortisone.

124
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,510
I don't think this was necessary at all.

125
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:45,690
With 10 ml at the most she will be OK and now she will be down to 2-3 ml.

126
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,340
She took much more cortisone to what she actually...

127
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:58,180
I did not know because we spoke once after this incident and you told me,

128
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:08,570
as far as I can remember, that after taking the cortisone she was better.

129
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,290
-No, before.

130
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:17,570
-Now you say before which is even more terrible that so much cortisone was given.

131
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,470
-The internal doctor had seen her 5 hours after she took the cortisone and he,

132
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,500
himself said, this can't be due to the cortisone.

133
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,240
-It's a pity.

134
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:36,930
-But I'm only dentist and I can't tell to an internal doctor what to do.

135
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:45,990
-Anyhow I wanted her to describe really the accident because she bought the car

136
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,080
and  few days later, she smashed it.

137
00:14:49,180 --> 00:15:01,660
And she was in a terrible state, she said I'll never drive again and she was destroyed totally.

138
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,010
-I got this car a week before as a present and I was on my way driving to Sabine

139
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:15,490
to her office and on a crossing I drove into another car and this woman in this car

140
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:22,160
got so frightened that she was speeding up and going downhill

141
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:33,680
and this car was completely smashed and mine wasn't. Mine got repaired afterwards.

142
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:41,320
-Yes but still she avoids to describe how she felt.

143
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:47,910
I think Sabine may remember better to describe her state.

144
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,580
-What was remarkable was this Thursday.

145
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,940
On Monday she had got Sulphur C200 and up to Thursday everything was gone.

146
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:02,160
The skin eruption was gone, the diarrhea was completely gone, the stool were completely normal

147
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,230
and one hour before she came to me to the practice, we spoke to one another

148
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:09,420
and she was in a very good mood.

149
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:15,250
She was completely OK and she told me that immediately, directly after this accident

150
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:21,490
the diarrhea started again, on the side of the accident already started

151
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,080
and when she came to my practice...

152
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,000
I mean I've seen her excited very often but this was more;

153
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:34,300
she was trembling over the whole body and she was crying all the time.

154
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:39,950
If something would have happened to this woman, if something would have happened to this woman...

155
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:45,560
And then we called you and you said, I should give her Aconite 1M and then just wait.

156
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,560
But she was in this state for hours.

157
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:56,090
And the colitis before was going on for 10-11 days and that was less than the colitis

158
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:59,100
that she had had before.

159
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,560
It wasn't so threatening for me but after this accident it was getting so much worse.

160
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,140
It was like a train takes off. You can just look from behind and see how it develops.

161
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,560
It was like hour by hour you could see how her state was aggravating,

162
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,530
getting worse and worse.

163
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:25,480
It was much worse than the three spells of colitis that I have observed before.

164
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:32,100
It was developing to great extreme and I had the impression that the Causticum

165
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,200
did not act, did not get it.

166
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,970
At first I was orienting myself concerning the symptomatology of the pain

167
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,550
because I could not get hold of you and I gave her Colocynthis.

168
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:50,630
In the evening it was clear to me that it must a case of Mercurius corrosivus

169
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:56,320
because it was going so fast and I really had a feeling she is slipping from my hands

170
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,080
and I couldn't think of another remedy.

171
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,410
And when she finally fell asleep after one hour even though her sleep was restless

172
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,650
and her mother was there and I was there, we were observing her.

173
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:14,070
But for the first time during these 14 days I was sort of relieved.

174
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,280
-Just before getting the cortisone.

175
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:23,220
-In the morning she already didn't have big stool. This passing stool was over already.

176
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,290
She couldn't stand because she had this lack and imbalance of electrolytes

177
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,300
and I wanted that the internal doctor would give her electrolytes.

178
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,710
And another remarkable thing is that at noon she rang me and she was feeling much better

179
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:43,160
and she told me that she wanted to go for motorcycle ride with her best friend.

180
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:47,320
And I thought I'm going to get a stroke, I couldn't believe it.

181
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:56,730
So fast and so rapid this course of disease has been, as fast and as rapid

182
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,430
it was stopped too afterwards.

183
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:08,050
-And she kept on taking Mercurius corrosivus during all this time?

184
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:15,070
-Yes on a daily basis until today. And she should say something concerning her energy

185
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:18,460
since this day because this is really remarkable too.

186
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:24,210
-I have a lot of energy, I do a lot of sports, I go out a lot in the evening,

187
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:29,390
go shopping and 4 times the week I do sports for 3 hours.

188
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:35,080
Twice the week and in addition to this I go for horse back riding.

189
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,080
-Very good.

190
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:47,810
-I've never seen her having so much energy during the 10 years that I know her.

191
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,660
-Is it true?
-Yes.

192
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,400
-How do you feel now concerning the colitis?
-Normal.

193
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,810
-And your thirst is...

194
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:20,050
-I have noticed some more things. The thirst got less,

195
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:24,220
the drinks don't need to be cold anymore.

196
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,130
With the double checks I still do it but not as often as before.

197
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:33,910
I have a lot of energy. Here, on this island I get tired very early.

198
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:39,080
Nevertheless I have a lot of energy throughout the day.

199
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,970
All together I'm more aggressive than before, not so adapted anymore.

200
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:49,050
I hated for example is somebody asked me the same questions 3-4 times

201
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:54,140
and then I'm afraid that on the open sea I could fall into the water,

202
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:01,610
that somebody could grab me from below. This fear of examination is still there.

203
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,280
Then I have a strong desire for bungee jumping...

204
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,210
-What is bungee jumping?

205
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:15,890
-You stand on a high bridge with this elastic chord and jump down.

206
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:24,490
-My god. She wants to do that?
-Yes and parachuting.

207
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:34,980
The day before yesterday we jumped down from a cliff, me and Eva.

208
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,630
-With this parachuting or with the string that goes down?

209
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:47,970
-She has desire for parachuting, to jump out from an airplane to go out to parachute

210
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:51,070
and for bungee jumping.

211
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,240
-And she did it already?
-No, I want to start it now.

212
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,210
-Anything else?

213
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:10,350
-I have a lot of bruises. When I hit something, the trembling got more again.

214
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,650
It's OK for the moment.

215
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,430
Yesterday it was really bad.

216
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,570
-Show me both your hands.

217
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:39,640
-It's not so bad now she said. The other fears are like my first history taking.

218
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:46,500
When I first came here for telling my history, with spiders and so on.

219
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:52,770
I have a disgust for fat, eat very little meat, mainly vegetables and fruits.

220
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:59,470
In addition to this I'm treated by another natural healing doctor.

221
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:08,820
He says he is going weight with the big masters.

222
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,600
I only went to see this doctor because I wanted to get this internal doctor

223
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,660
out of the game.

224
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:26,940
-This new doctor is using natural healing?

225
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:33,210
-He is an anthroposophic doctor but he says he is gonna stay out of this homeopathic treatment.

226
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:37,000
But I have to have a medical doctor in the background.

227
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,490
-Yes sure.

228
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:46,460
-He only gives Biogain which is a remedy just to build up the flora of the intestines.

229
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:55,240
-That's OK as long as he does not give a lot of mixtures and confuse it.

230
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:01,840
-Aversion fat strongly, underline three times.

231
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:16,470
-Little meat, disgust for fat, mainly vegetables and fruits she likes, full grain

232
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:22,770
and yogurt and chicken.

233
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,850
-Sweets?
-Little.

234
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:32,130
-And thirst is normal, cold or hot.
-It doesn't matter.

235
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:35,640
-This excessive thirst for cold water is totally gone?

236
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,350
-Yes.

237
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,280
-Something else I wanted to ask you from the first time.

238
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:48,390
She had reported brittle finger nails, how are they now?

239
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,580
-Still brittle.

240
00:24:52,100 --> 00:25:00,810
-Also she had reported aggravation from onions.

241
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,650
-Raw onions.

242
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,640
-She can eat now?
-I haven't tried it so far.

243
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:15,290
-Also she had reported fear of the dark.
-Yes.

244
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,470
-So she says now she has suppressed anger.

245
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,390
She says now the anger comes out more easily?
-Yes.

246
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,710
-And she feels good with that?

247
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:32,400
-Yes, I didn't really remark it, she told me. Other people tell me.

248
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,710
-Also she had involuntary urination while laughing?

249
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,490
-Only former times, not now.

250
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:53,060
-The feeling that she has forgotten to do things is still there?

251
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
-Every now and then.

252
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:03,060
-Also the sleep was unrefreshing. You wake up in the morning and you feel good?

253
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,900
-No, I'm still tired.

254
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,260
-But in comparison with previously is it better?

255
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,400
-Yes.

256
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:25,290
-Also how is her sexual desire, energy?
-The same as before.

257
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:32,570
-Not much interest. She had reported aversion to...

258
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:44,670
-Also she had reported timidity in public appearing.

259
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,740
-That is still.

260
00:26:51,710 --> 00:27:00,410
-Bite her nails still?
-Only very rarely when I'm excited.

261
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,890
-Cold, hot how is the general state of the body?

262
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,070
-Warm.

263
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:14,730
-And she really suffers from that? When she is in a close room,

264
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:18,120
she has to go and open the windows?

265
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,840
-No, not to this extend?

266
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,060
-The feet are warm in bed?
-Yes.

267
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,610
-Burning, so she has to stick them out of covers?

268
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,650
-No.

269
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:34,200
-The skin eruption is not at all there?
-No.

270
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:47,230
-She is happy, she is quite happy with her life?
-Yes, for the time being.

271
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,180
-So you drive again?
-Yes.

272
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,860
-So you are a very healthy child.
-For the time being yes.

273
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:18,350
-OK, we'll talk in the class and we decide what to do with you further.

274
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:56,600
When we started the first day, we talked about this progress in the disease patterns

275
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:02,690
changing to different levels and if you remember we said,

276
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:13,630
in case we have here a physical element together with mental or emotional problems,

277
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:23,130
when you give the remedy here, then it's going to have a big reaction on the physical level.

278
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:27,860
Of course the moment that you see the mental-emotional and this is the problem

279
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,990
with all these cases, where together with the physical symptoms you see

280
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,120
mental-emotional symptomatology.

281
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:46,160
And you try to cure, then first you are going to have a severe physical reaction

282
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,300
on the physical body.

283
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,300
Where it belongs this case here in the scale?

284
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,080
It belongs somewhere here, you see?

285
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:22,050
Lower three. You need several remedies before you bring about a cure

286
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:32,830
and the cure is also doubtful in these levels. The final cure is doubtful.

287
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:42,750
Now with her case, the reactions have been too dramatic.

288
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:49,590
You just hear it but when you live every day with the fever, with 20 stool,

289
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:55,490
with blood and... then it's a different story.

290
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:08,230
And Sabine was on the telephone every day. Every day 8 o'clock

291
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:15,780
we had an appointment except of that weekend when the 15 mg were given.

292
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,390
This I considered it a very unfortunate thing to happen because I told you many times

293
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:25,680
we have to go back under stress.

294
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:31,790
Here what happened is while she was going down here she had this big reaction,

295
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,120
she is now going towards the next level.

296
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:40,440
In this phase she gets a big stress.

297
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:48,350
I mean you could here nothing here from the stress but the girl was destroyed

298
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:54,700
because she just had a new car and was damaged and she could not retain.

299
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:03,950
She was trembling, she was totally destroyed and immediately you see it starts with the point

300
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:07,580
where the weakness is.

301
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:17,030
And there is a mistake in potency.

302
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:22,820
Here I should have given Aconitum 50M or CM straight away.

303
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:32,380
You need a great fright where you decide this is a Stramonium possibility...

304
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,730
It could have been Stramonium actually.

305
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:43,260
I don't know if I gave the correct remedy here with Aconite.

306
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:50,090
I'm not sure it's the correct but anyhow I should have given higher.

307
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,450
1M is not enough to counteract.

308
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:16,910
Also you see the reaction in the skin. But you need the reaction in the skin permanently.

309
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:30,800
You need to have the skin permanently in a bad condition. Then you are more happy.

310
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:37,400
Because here what happens is the organism tries and then gives up and then

311
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:44,320
the skin eruption is back and then he tries and the skin eruption is back.

312
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:57,110
Now I believe that if in that stress period, if she had contacted me

313
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:03,810
and I had agreed to give cortisone, I would never had agreed to give more than 10 mg.

314
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:16,180
There is no question that the treatment so far has helped her a lot so far in spite

315
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:22,600
of the cortisone. And always it happens like this.

316
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:30,440
When you have to enter during this time with chemical drugs in general

317
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:40,990
and especially with cortisone, find out that much less cortisone than in the beginning.

318
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:51,550
Here she was given 12.5 mg when she came, 10 by mouth and 2.5 by enema.

319
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:58,180
Now if she receives 12.5 here, at the most she can get here during the crisis 10

320
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,130
and within 15 days it could go to 5.

321
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:18,710
Now she is for one and a half month taking cortisone and we have to bring it down of course

322
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:25,350
much faster to see what happens.

323
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:37,860
So at this moment you see how difficult it is to see the remedy.

324
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,020
It's very difficult because the child feels good.

325
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:52,850
She feels good but the cortisone is covering up certain of the symptomatology.

326
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:01,620
If we had a clear picture at this moment, we could stop the cortisone

327
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:16,660
and give again the remedy. Do we have? No. Let's see what says here the analysis.

328
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:29,010
Impulse to run? Who said that?

329
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:34,270
-The bungee jumping, shall I take it out?

330
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,150
-Yes, take it out.

331
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,340
Trembling of hands, fear of spiders, fear of the dark, aversion fat, desires vegetables,

332
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:59,800
fruits, brittle nails, public appearing timidity. No more?

333
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:22,390
Show me the Expert System. Medorrhinum, Carcinosin, Carbo vegetabilis, Gelsemium.

334
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:40,930
There is a possibility for both of these remedies but still we don't have

335
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:47,530
enough symptomatology and even if we had some indications towards...

336
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:55,400
more indications still I would be careful at this moment not to give a remedy

337
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,980
because she is under the cortisone and the moment that she stops the cortisone,

338
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,400
the picture may totally change.

339
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:16,460
So therefore the strategy which we have to follow in this case is to reduce slowly

340
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,780
the cortisone, very slowly.

341
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:27,930
That means in a month to reduce it to 2 mg and in the meantime see

342
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,500
whether she will develop a picture.

343
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,140
-One question.

344
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,200
As far as I understood she is still also taking Mercurius corrosivus on a daily basis.

345
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,410
What about that?
-Yes, she still is.

346
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:51,280
I will stop the Mercurius as well. I will stop the Mercurius together

347
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:56,420
with the stopping of cortisone.

348
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:05,680
Diminishing of cortisone, she can continue taking the Mercurius until this cortisone is out.

349
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:10,270
Once the cortisone is out, I will stop the Mercurius as well.

350
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,850
-Sorry for interfering but I'm really wondering why?

351
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:24,630
Why are you going to stop it at the same time?

352
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:29,430
Because then how do you know if she could stay due to the cortisone or due to the Mercury?

353
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:35,840
-Yes, so I will find out if I stop both but I don't want to stop the Mercury now

354
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:43,050
and leave only the cortisone and then from the cortisone... We would like to cure her.

355
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:52,770
If we stop both and she is cured, we say thank god it's OK. The idea is not playing tricks.

356
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:58,630
The idea is to find out exactly the truth. what is happening.

357
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,830
So what is the best way to find what I happening in that organism at this moment?

358
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:13,550
At this moment she looks so well but she is under the influence of cortisone.

359
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:18,530
So therefore we have to stop the cortisone. Why stop the cortisone

360
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:26,810
and then either we stop the Mercury immediately now and we stop the cortisone later

361
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:34,970
but I would like to have the influence of Mercury because I don't know how much is

362
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:39,790
because of cortisone and how much is because of Mercury.

363
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:47,400
So I will continue even the Mercury for a few days after stopping the cortisone,

364
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,360
I will continue, so I'll have the influence of the Mercury going on.

365
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:59,720
The idea of repeating cases of cortisone, repeating every day and perhaps twice

366
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:07,510
of three times the day, the possibility is that cortisone nullifies the treatment.

367
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:13,860
Therefore you have to repeat again, cortisone nullifies, again to repeat,

368
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,930
so you have a good condition.

369
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:24,170
-It is my impression that maybe she is already producing a bit of symptomatology

370
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:28,760
due to the Mercury with these ideas that she wants to go bungee jumping now

371
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:34,700
and parachuting getting these kicks from dangerous things. Is it possible?

372
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:43,350
-No. First of all I have not seen this in Mercury, producing ...

373
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:48,360
It is a tendency of Causticum.

374
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:53,350
Causticum children they go dangerous things, we have said that.

375
00:41:53,450 --> 00:42:04,490
Causticum children they may climb in this window and look like this... They don't care.

376
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,090
Causticum children but not Mercury, I'm not sure. I don't see any symptoms of Mercury.

377
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:19,270
I wish she would have said, I 'm salivating, I wish I'd have seen some peculiar symptoms

378
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:27,630
of Mercury which shows that Mercury is still needed and still acting. I did not see.

379
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:30,930
I did not want to push her to say symptoms.

380
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,580
-I'd like to add something. Since she developed the colitis first,

381
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:43,070
she always had the relapses when she was down to 12 mg of cortisone.

382
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:47,690
Now in the meantime she is already down to 7.5 mg.

383
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:52,490
-There is no question that she is much better.

384
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:59,510
-If you want to see which result has the cortisone or where the Mercury is working,

385
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:08,060
why you do not continue to keep run the Mercury for a longer period of time

386
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:14,330
rather than ending at the same time or continue a few days and see in that result?

387
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:24,290
-If she feels good during the time that she finishes with cortisone and she continues

388
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:29,120
for a few days, as we said she can continue with Mercury for a few days

389
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:39,890
and she still feels good then we stop and we find out whether this case needs Medorrhinum

390
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:47,070
or Carcinosin or Causticum again or whatever, Sepia, I don't know.

391
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,720
-And the other question I had.

392
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:55,350
Once you have the mental-emotional at their high pathology and the physical symptoms come back

393
00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:03,570
with a stronger symptomatology, at that point where there is this physical crisis,

394
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:10,940
are you saying is it preferable to use minimal allopathic medication

395
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,820
than homeopathic medication?

396
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:30,030
-Not at this case. This case she presented a very dramatic physical picture with fever,

397
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:37,990
with lot of losing blood, the anemia was very strong, she was freezing etc.

398
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:44,680
You have some pictures, then you have to prescribe.

399
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,500
Here you can't say let's wait and see what

400
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:54,880
happens, no. Sabine said I felt she was going out.

401
00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:01,670
So you have to prescribe and if your prescription does nothing, then I said

402
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,710
you resort to allopathic drugs.

403
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:19,220
But not as a rule. Because I feel it was unfortunate she had this accident.

404
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,260
It was very unfortunate by the time.

405
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,230
It's like karmic. It's like something happens in the fate of the person.

406
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:35,070
The moment she is getting better, here comes another and says I will not let you be well.

407
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:44,530
-In her case it was karmic. The question I have is that you give whatever is required

408
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,540
from homeopathic remedies in that situation to get through the crisis?

409
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,980
-Yes to get her through as long as you see that there is some kind of action

410
00:45:53,080 --> 00:46:00,670
but if you give here 10 remedies and no remedy is acting, what are you going to do?

411
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:10,320
-Is it possible at all in the situation where 1.5 becomes 1.4 and the shock develops

412
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,090
and everything, to find the correct remedy?

413
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:20,150
-Under the shock? If the shock helps you to find the remedy? What is the question?

414
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:27,580
-Presuming we do find the correct remedy, can we then always stop this relapse from happening

415
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:35,680
or is the situation too unstable?

416
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:43,110
-Here you don't call it a relapse. A relapse after the accident?

417
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:53,320
It depends on the severity of the relapse.

418
00:46:53,420 --> 00:47:01,140
During this time where there is a stress, you may give a dose of Aconitum high

419
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:09,180
or you give a dose of Stramonium and things are controlled but you may need 2-3 remedies

420
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:17,120
before you can control this aggravation. It's not a relapse really, it's an aggravation.

421
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:25,400
You see the moment she is starting the physical body taking most of the impact,

422
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:31,360
you see the skin eruption is affected and the mucus membranes

423
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:45,290
but in such a way as to endanger life, therefore you don't wait and see or things like that.

424
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,440
Wait and see what?

425
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:57,640
You see she is going away... As long as you have the possibility to wait, you do wait.

426
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:08,350
-Before the accident happened you gave her Sulphur 200 and after that she had a good sleep,

427
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:12,770
she even slept in the afternoon and then...

428
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:27,010
-She developed a skin eruption, strong skin eruption and the stool went almost normal

429
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,920
or not exactly normal but much better.

430
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:34,750
-Yes and then she had the car accident and it changed all.

431
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:40,240
And you take it, you gave Aconite...

432
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:45,220
-Why I gave Aconite? Why I preferred Aconite? Because I've given Sulphur.

433
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,050
Sulphur has acted, we know that Sulphur and Aconite are complementary.

434
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:54,190
So we have a big fright.

435
00:48:55,110 --> 00:48:59,850
The first thing I would think, she was in a terrible state,

436
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:11,430
therefore Aconite complementing the action of Sulphur but, as I said, the potency was wrong,

437
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,610
it was too low.

438
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:20,160
For this case the potency should have been 50M.

439
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:26,980
That's why I gave Aconite but I did not have...

440
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:32,000
Maybe if I was examining the case I would find out it's not an Aconite case,

441
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,200
it's a case of Stramonium.

442
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:39,570
-And you take it again and again and you lose the thing of Sulphur but the thing is that

443
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:45,100
I have an experience with my cases and I see it now after 9 years

444
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:50,810
when something like this happens, an accident, a dentist,

445
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:57,190
I lose the right remedy and after half a year I see what I did wrong.

446
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:04,060
-Yes, that is true because during the stress the organism produces another picture

447
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:09,500
which is similar but not exact as before, it's similar.

448
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:17,930
-What I want to know is why not go back to Sulphur 200 after the Aconite?

449
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:21,520
Why Mercury, why not Sulphur since Sulphur was working so well?

450
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:27,020
-I do not give her.

451
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:34,010
It was the time when she could not find me and then she made some decision.

452
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:40,580
Colocynthis seems to have been indicated and she was right when she gave Colocynthis.

453
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:45,330
-She said that the Causticum was given but just before the Aconite...

454
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:53,910
-Yes because of the cramps of the calves. This is typical, if you open the Repertory

455
00:50:54,010 --> 00:51:00,940
this is typical of Causticum. It is the first remedy which started the whole issue.

456
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:05,580
Then I thought that's a relapse, give Causticum.

457
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:11,090
-I want to correct one thing. Eva has always been taking an afternoon nap,

458
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:13,330
ever since the disease started.

459
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:45,180
-Why this case is difficult? Do you know why? Because she has this kind of ideas,

460
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:52,720
these fixed ideas where she has to turn back and check and check.

461
00:51:53,950 --> 00:52:03,770
That makes the case difficult. Otherwise it would be much more easy.

462
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:14,230
Without the ideas it would be upper three level, just the ulcerative colitis, upper three.

463
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:32,880
What is also showing the severity of the case is the fact that she has the C reactive protein so high.

464
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:46,100
That indicates a systemic disease, collagen disease and that indicates that in the process

465
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:58,390
of curing the case, then we may see some rheumatoid arthritis developing in here.

466
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:17,060
Luna, Jesus Christ, take it out, I can't see it.

467
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:33,300
The one who puts this, it says lunatic. Take it out.

468
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:46,570
Well I put as a test in the Journal, I put a case of Pulsatilla and say, what is the remedy?

469
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:55,840
About 12 people they wrote back and they said this is a Luna. I said, Luna what is this?

470
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:06,900
But if everyone gives Luna to all his patients,

471
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:13,030
I'm sure three patients will have a very good reaction.

472
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:20,540
Because of the placebo effect, because of different other factors.
