1
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,960
In the first case, let me see what it says here.

2
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:43,510
...Feels tired all the time, unable to resist any demand in his work, exhaustion.

3
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,760
He has developed constant anxiety, anxiety in bed at night, better after rising

4
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,570
in the morning, anxiety of conscience, as if he has committed some crime,

5
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,740
feels he is not good in his work, has not done enough for his patients,

6
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,490
he can not enjoy sex anymore, feels anxious after having sex, constant homesickness

7
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,320
for his home place, his parents, where he lived his youth.

8
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,410
He feels that if he could go there, he could become well but he can not leave his work.

9
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:22,160
Fears in dark, of embedded disease, of death, of fainting, of losing his reason...

10
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,430
Fear of suffocation when lying...

11
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,010
Have you done your homework?

12
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,770
Who wants to speak?

13
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,770
Nobody.

14
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,190
Nobody wants to speak.

15
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,930
-I will give him Carbo animalis.

16
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,170
-Why?

17
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:16,080
-Because he feels conflict and also the idea is the same.

18
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:25,750
-Only the fears, OK. Somebody else?

19
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,310
-The main characteristic of Carbo animalis I think it is the homesickness,

20
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:47,060
always having contact with his parents, also the feeling that I will be well, if I can go home.

21
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,210
This is the center of the remedy.

22
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:59,730
-But it's not enough because home sick we have also Phosphoric acid, Capsicum.

23
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,770
Show me home sickness. See how many remedies are there?

24
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,160
Mercury, I have not seen...

25
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,260
Carbo animalis, Ignatia...

26
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:38,330
But the main remedies are Capsicum, Carbo animalis, Phosphoric acid.

27
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:45,660
For me these 3 remedies are very strong home sickness.

28
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,000
Capsicum is together with a feeling of nostalgia.

29
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,850
-What led me to the idea of Carbo animalis in the first place was this being overwhelmed

30
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:17,700
from work, the inability to withdraw from his work and this paired with the home sickness.

31
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,660
-What it looks like this symptom with which other remedy we have been discussing?

32
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:40,400
-I think the difference to Capsicum is that Capsicum has strong other symptoms,

33
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:48,300
for spicy things and Capsicum is totally unable to do anything, he is lying there.

34
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,680
In our case he is still working, he is able to do his duty.

35
00:04:52,780 --> 00:05:04,010
-This desire to do, to work and not being able to resist the demand of others,

36
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,780
we have spoken on another remedy as well.

37
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:17,600
Natrum carbonicum. This is similar, the exhaustion is similar.

38
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:24,380
Once I'm exhausted, anybody can come and ask me to take his case.

39
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:31,030
So they know, when I'm exhausted everybody comes and say take my case and I can't resist.

40
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,520
When there is depletion of energy, then you can not...

41
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,680
But some remedies act this way or that way.

42
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,430
Natrum carbonicum or Carbo animalis they can not resist.

43
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,620
They try and try until they collapse.

44
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:58,760
-I used the rubric fear of suffocation due to mucus in the throat and there

45
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,610
Carbo animalis is the only remedy.

46
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:09,360
Also in the rubric fear of suffocation on closing the eyes, there also is Carbo animalis

47
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:15,270
in there and in another rubric fear of suffocation while lying.

48
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,300
In this rubric there are two remedies Moschus and Carbo animalis also.

49
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,150
-Who prescribed Carbo animalis in this case?

50
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,730
Very good.

51
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,220
These cases I have manipulated it to make them more easy.

52
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:45,730
Don't think that you will get in practice so easy cases.

53
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,640
You add one or two symptoms there and you make it easy.

54
00:06:52,650 --> 00:07:03,550
Still you have to start thinking rightly because this case it could have been without the fears

55
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:15,050
and home sickness with the tired feeling and not being able to resist,

56
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,630
that's enough for Carbo animalis.

57
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,970
Carbo animalis is very tired, it can not resist.

58
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:35,950
And if you have another keynote, while lying in bed they get chilliness, coldness,

59
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,060
when they first lie in bed.

60
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,550
A man suffering with duodenal ulcer.

61
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,730
... his business, his wife and his money.

62
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,710
He started building up his life again but since then he is suffering very much

63
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:55,890
with cramping pains that come from 3-4 after eating.

64
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:08,250
If he takes fruit that is bad for him but like onions, sweets... become worse.

65
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:14,320
His pains are better if he eats some biscuits or drink some milk.

66
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:20,130
The pain wake him in the night also but are worse around 6-7 pm as well.

67
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:25,090
...and then in the night at around 10 pm. No breakfast.

68
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,960
He used to be a very cool businessman but now he suffers with fears and anxieties.

69
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,130
Anxiety when alone, cramp in stomach, when hungry.

70
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:41,150
His anxiety arises from stomach together with pain but especially during sleep.

71
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,460
He is anxious about his future...

72
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,810
Who wants to speak about this case?

73
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,380
-I think that this case shows three remedies right straight.

74
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,130
Arsenicum album, Nux vomica and Kali Carbonicum and when you look at the fears

75
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,240
which are occurring in this case, they are resembling between Arsenicum album

76
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,960
or Nux vomica and I think these 2 kinds of fears I see on Nux vomica

77
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,640
because Arsenicum album has no fear of poverty. It is very strange in this case.

78
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:21,540
This man suffers from the first bankrupt and then he is still all the years

79
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:29,720
are committing by the fear already be without any money.

80
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,470
It is periodic on this case seems strange to go against Arsenicum.

81
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:41,880
This person is worse at 8 o'clock and it is periodic seems to be Nux vomica

82
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:48,040
looking at the Repertory at Arsenicum and it's worse at midnight.

83
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:54,290
All the other symptoms fit and in my sense to Nux vomica as the result and

84
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,930
Arsenicum is the second, Kali Carbonicum is the third.

85
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,400
-Who agrees with this explanation?

86
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,480
-If you don't agree you have to give your own version.

87
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,240
-I think that it is an Arsenicum case.

88
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:32,050
-You think it is an Arsenicum case? That means you agree with him.

89
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,830
-No.

90
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,720
-What did he say? He said Nux vomica finally.

91
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,680
Sorry.

92
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,460
-At least to my Repertory if I understood correctly it was stated that Arsenicum

93
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,540
does not have fear of poverty and in my Repertory it does have fear of poverty

94
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,400
and has tremendous anxieties.

95
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,960
This fear also being injured and suffering again as he had in the past was the fear

96
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:12,060
that I included, that's why I elected for Arsenicum.

97
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:21,400
-I thought of different remedies I might give him but then I looked at the rubric fear when hungry.

98
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,710
And for me this is a peculiar symptom which up to now I only knew from Iodine.

99
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:37,960
Also this combination with the anxiety that rises up from the stomach and

100
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:45,980
when you look at the entire pathology in the whole case, I decided for Kali Carbonicum.

101
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:53,820
-It is the first rubric, it's not the stomach, it is abdomen ulceration, quite another rubric.

102
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,980
A long time I thought about this, it is a different kind of rubrics.

103
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,810
All the problems he has are arising from the stomach but ulceration is not in the stomach.

104
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:16,570
-Take it out. Find abdominal ulcer.

105
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,030
-But there is a cross reference in abdominal ulcer to go back to stomach ulcer.

106
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:30,640
-There is a cross reference. This is not important because, as we said,

107
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:37,040
we have other symptoms, which are general symptoms, mental symptoms, so therefore

108
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,460
the local symptoms per se are not of great importance.

109
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,790
They should not change a prescription which comes when you take the whole,

110
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:57,040
it should not change the prescription. Even if there was a change here, I would not take it.

111
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,480
Put abdominal.

112
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,060
Show me the rubric in ulcers.

113
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,360
-Not Kali Carbonicum.

114
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:29,790
-But these ulcers do not refer to internal ulcers.

115
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,000
They do not refer to duodenum or anything to do with the duodenum.

116
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:58,210
Duodenal ulcer it does not matter whether it is on the duodenal, in the beginning of the guts.

117
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:09,520
People will show their stomach I have a pain here and the time element, so the location

118
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,200
and the time element goes for...

119
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:23,450
You have to find the time element and the location where the person feels the pain.

120
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,520
-Abdominal ulcers is not a rubric. I put it there underlined 3 times,

121
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,870
it doesn't change the repertorization.

122
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:47,460
-Who has prescribed Kali carbonicum? Very good.
