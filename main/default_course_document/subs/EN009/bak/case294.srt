1
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,010
-You can tell us what is the problem.

2
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:40,760
-The problem in my life is unprotected, vulnerability in my entire life, a weakness

3
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,260
which has been running through in my entire life.

4
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:53,010
An emptiness in the stomach and the feeling of an inner enemy, an internal enemy.

5
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:58,770
I would like to tell you the story of my life and I would like to differentiate between

6
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:06,110
my physical diseases and mental-emotional problems.

7
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:14,260
I was not nourished by my own mother but by a woman who feeds children.

8
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,510
I had strabismus, I was operated twice.

9
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,600
-In one eye? Right?

10
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:32,220
-I can not remember and the result was that on my right eye, I have weakness of the one side, myopia.

11
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,960
During one of these operations, during the anesthesia I made the experience of a

12
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:48,460
feeling as if I was captured in a tube, which had several holes through which rods

13
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,060
were coming in to hurt me.

14
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,630
What I remember from my earliest childhood was that I always had an aversion

15
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:03,480
to water because every time I came in contact with water, I had a strong itching.

16
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,230
And I could not bear wool at all.

17
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:23,790
When I was 6 years old an axe hit me on the head. I can not tell you anything more

18
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,070
about it because I was unconscious after that, I can't remember how it happened

19
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,670
and nobody afterwards ever told me what the issue was.

20
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,170
-Nobody ever told him?
-No.

21
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:50,180
-But it was an axe or it was a wood that felt down.
-It was an axe.

22
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:07,610
Between my 3 and 5 year of life I had very soft bones, so the legs bend outside

23
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:19,110
and this was treated by orthopedic exercises and other physical therapy.

24
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:26,130
When I was 14 I had a severe pneumonia in the midst of summer,

25
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,800
 when I was 17 I had a severe purulent inflammation of the lymph nodes

26
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:42,880
with many  abscesses in the area of the neck which were opened surgically, without anesthesia.

27
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:58,530
In 23 years I had hepatitis, I was turned yellow, in 25 I had again large boils on the

28
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:04,130
buttocks which I opened myself with a razor blade.

29
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:15,780
Age 23-45 I had a recurrent lumbago which I cured myself by doing exercises and by

30
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,130
running, I don't suffer from it anymore.

31
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,870
In this time, meaning up to the age of 45 years I was never able to stand longer than

32
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,720
5 minutes at 1 time.

33
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,480
During my other times of working I never was ill otherwise.

34
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,950
My life disease occurred in February of this year. I had a severe bronchitis which

35
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:55,290
healed by itself, spontaneously, without medication but for 4 weeks I was not able

36
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:58,140
to work because I could not concentrate.

37
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,510
-He did not take antibiotics?
-No.

38
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,780
-Homeopathic?
- Yes, I will tell you later.

39
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:16,520
-I'd like to continue over with my emotional things. For 3 years my father during a

40
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:22,950
vacation we had, he threw me into very deep water because I did not want to go in

41
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,110
voluntarily and finally some time he pulled me out of it again.

42
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:34,550
But I remember up to today how I was screaming below the surface of the water.

43
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:42,740
My mother was very strict and all my sins were punished by beating on my neck

44
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,990
and buttocks. Maybe I may tell you an example.

45
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:52,740
One example when I went to school during winter, I always had to wear long woolen

46
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,240
socks going up to here which were attached to holders.

47
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:04,240
And as I could not tolerate the wool on my skin, every day when I went to school

48
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:10,020
I took them off. I did that for about one week and then my school called my mother

49
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,360
and complained that I arrived in school frozen, blue every morning.

50
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,940
And for this also I was punished in the way I had described.

51
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,440
Another example, one day it was raining and I was playing with a boyfriend of the

52
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:30,440
neighbor and we were sliding down the hill on our pants because it was so much fun

53
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,490
and of course the pants were damaged.

54
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,960
And for this I got punished in the way I described.

55
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,380
-By his mother?

56
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:47,630
-Yes from my mother. When I was 8 years old my father died from hemorrhage in the

57
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:56,050
brain; my father was a surgeon and during the entire war from 1939-1944 he had

58
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,860
always been present in the different front areas of the war.

59
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:11,890
I actually hardly know my father at all. I saw him once before his death and then he

60
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:17,390
gave me his hand and told me I should take care for my mother.

61
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:27,390
From 1942-1945 the time is described best with all the bombardments that were coming

62
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:37,380
all the time, the air attacks and the fear of being in a small tiny basement, a shelter with

63
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,380
the walls and the ceiling coming down upon me.

64
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:50,040
The years from 1943-1948 were characterized by hunger because we did not have

65
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:55,470
enough to eat. I was completely thin, I had lost my weight and since my father was not

66
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:08,770
alive anymore and we lived with my grandfather, we did not have enough money to buy extra food.

67
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:26,520
In 1947 my mother got pernicious anemia which in that time was incurable and

68
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:33,270
progressed in spite of the therapies which were possible on that time.

69
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:41,430
She came into severe depression and twice tried to commit suicide with gas.

70
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:48,680
From that time on I always had the fear inside me that whenever I may enter the

71
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,810
apartment, we might all explode together.

72
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:58,890
This is also the reason why I always turn off the gas and I always kept the key with me.

73
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:08,310
When I was 15, I travelled to relatives during my school holidays.

74
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:15,310
During this time my mother committed....

75
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:21,260
and she was never recovered. And she left me a letter. Word by word said, she

76
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,560
disappeared in one of the Bavarian (?) and her body was never found.

77
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:33,820
She left me a letter in which she wrote to me that her death was my fault because

78
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,790
I had not passed 7th grade at school.

79
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:49,660
The sister of my mother then took me into her house and I finished my final exams in

80
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,660
high school (?) Medicine.

81
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:02,160
Besides my studies in Medicine I also dealt a lot with philosophy because I was looking

82
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,790
for possibility to develop my own personality.

83
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:10,430
And the development of my own personality was much influenced by Herman Hesse

84
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,030
of whom I read every book.

85
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,030
He also illustrated to me that the development of personality can only come out of

86
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:31,780
oneself and he also illustrated to me the connection between heart and love.

87
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:39,530
I then finished my final exams in Medicine... filled with joy that I had passed the exams.

88
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,830
We turned home to my step family and to my grandfather. My grandfather was the one

89
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,530
that made it possible for me to study.

90
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:53,740
Of course I always had to work alongside during holidays but without my grandfather

91
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,990
I would not have been able to study.

92
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:04,770
During this visit where I came home filled of joy that I finished exams to tell me my grandfather

93
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:24,520
the only son of this step family killed himself by shooting himself. And he died in my arms.

94
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:30,440
In 1965 I married and I have 3 daughters.

95
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:43,770
From 1965 on I started specializing. I started with surgery and internal medicine and

96
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:52,770
then later specialized for anestheology and intensive care at the University of Munich.

97
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,430
It was a period of very hard work because during those times the assistant doctors

98
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,680
were in the clinic mostly day and night.

99
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:10,470
In 1970 I got a call from the hospital in Lansberg to become the chief surgeon there.

100
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:21,680
The head doctor. During those times intensive care medicine was only starting to

101
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:28,680
develop and it was very hard work to develop this kind of intensive care unit in this

102
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,430
clinic because up to then nothing had existed in this clinic.

103
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:38,180
During that time not only started the intensive care within the clinic but I also spread it

104
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,930
out of the clinic, in the surrounding area because I saw how many people were dying

105
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:48,180
because they have found no proper care.

106
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,930
Then I set up this emergency doctor system.

107
00:12:54,030 --> 00:13:01,690
Professionally was a very good time for me and I also was a very known doctor at

108
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:11,180
that time and it was one of my main goals to teach my assistants in a protective way.

109
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,520
Protective teaching.

110
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,350
-I don't understand.

111
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:20,340
-His assistant doctors who were learning from him, it was one of his main goals to

112
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:30,420
teach them in a protective way; this means I protected them from the personal attacks

113
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:36,920
or arguments which always are found in this kind of hospitals, I protected them from

114
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:45,840
that so that they have really time to learn.

115
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:51,920
I had very good assistants and all the assistants that they have learned from me up

116
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:57,340
to today say that they really were able to learn a lot in a very good way in the clinic

117
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,310
when they studied under me.

118
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:06,310
I had developed a special sensitivity for threatening complications in patients who

119
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:12,060
were in the hospital and it was really strange that I usually, without having been

120
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:19,310
notified, appeared in the hospital when the situation was occurring.

121
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:27,060
Although the funding or the establishing of the family for me always was most valuable

122
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,810
or is the most valuable and I've been faithful to my wife all these years.

123
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:41,560
In spite of that our common understanding drifted apart more and more over the years.

124
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,530
It was very important to me to keep the children away and protect them from

125
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:51,480
witnessing personal arguments between my wife and myself.

126
00:14:51,580 --> 00:15:01,230
In 1980 after 15 years of marriage we have had a very open house, also a

127
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:13,140
Lutheran priest came to our house and in my wife an unbelievable change took place.

128
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,900
All of a sudden she dressed beautifully and was completely changed.

129
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,890
Since the operations in the hospital usually took longer than noon, I often only came

130
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:36,230
home late for lunch [...] with my wife and my children on the family table on my chair.

131
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:42,230
I also met his wife, the wife of this pastor and immediately I felt an unbelievable

132
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:51,480
vibration between her and me but for another half a year I kept trying to get my wife back.

133
00:15:51,580 --> 00:16:00,480
And so I fell in love and developed closer relationship with the wife of this pastor.

134
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:08,060
I tried to resolve these problems in discussions, the 4 of us had together and to try and

135
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:15,390
clear what were the real true feelings but for me was not possible anymore to go back

136
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,170
to my wife.

137
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:24,000
When this decision became clear for me, then my wife and also the pastor wanted to

138
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:32,800
go back to the situation that had been before.

139
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:40,800
-Which is the situation? Staying each with his wife?

140
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:49,050
-Exactly. But for me was not anymore possible and so I decided to take over the

141
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:54,470
responsibility and to die.

142
00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:02,720
But since it is not possible today into our area to just go into the woods and die

143
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:09,320
I planned a suicide in which I was going to hit a tree driving the car.

144
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:16,970
And I planned it very precisely, as to ensure that nobody would ever feel any guilt

145
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:22,230
thinking that he might be the cause of my death.

146
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:31,220
It was supposed to be just an accident and I chose a day on which many people were

147
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:40,570
in my family and we were taken care of and protected and I then progressed in

148
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:48,830
committing the suicide by in advance injecting myself several anesthetic medications.

149
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:55,980
I wanted to be absolutely sure that I will die and I had exactly 12 seconds between the

150
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,730
injection and hitting the tree.

151
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:09,480
I chose a street where I could look very far away ahead to see if any other car was coming or not. Why I survived this death?

152
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:18,960
It is against any known toxicology but since I did survive this death, I assume I suppose

153
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,210
to continue living and since then I have never thought of committing suicide again.

154
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,880
-Let me understand. He went into the car and he drove against the tree or he never

155
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,210
did that?

156
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:37,710
-Yes, I was sitting in the car, the engine was running, I injected the medication and I had

157
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:44,810
planned exactly precisely, so I knew how much time had left and the time between

158
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:50,560
injection and falling unconscious, I used to crash against the tree.

159
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,650
-And he did it?

160
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,810
-Yes, the car was a complete wreck.

161
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:02,310
-And he got out being injured by this?

162
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:13,910
-Yes on my head but otherwise hardly at all. It was an absolute miracle.

163
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,960
-So he was in deep depression by this time.

164
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:27,130
-Yes and actually it was a good ending for me at that time because I had done good

165
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,460
work, I have been good to my family, they were well taken care of, I had done

166
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:38,210
everything in this life which I could do and it was a good time to end it.

167
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,130
Everything was taken care.

168
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,210
-And how many years ago it was this?

169
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:54,130
-1980. Then it was an intensive care in Munich, they put me together again and so on this

170
00:19:54,230 --> 00:20:00,710
way I also experienced intensive care on myself and returned to work in my hospital

171
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,710
after 2 months.

172
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:10,540
I must say that all people around me protected me in an unbelievable way.

173
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:19,460
Beginning from the politicians all the way to the employees on the hospital.

174
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:26,890
I had told you that anestheology and intensive care had developed up to that time and

175
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:38,630
it was then a kind of medicine I would call human integrated medicine because we

176
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,380
respected life but we also respected death.

177
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:55,380
But within future development which begun in 1980-1981 these areas got more

178
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,550
self-independent and developed into human disintegrated medicine.

179
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,300
Of course I could bring many examples but I think it's sufficient if I just explain it

180
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,880
this way.

181
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,710
And so in 1986 I decided to resign from this hospital because this kind of medicine

182
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:19,050
became unbearable for me.

183
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,540
Then started in Homeopathy and I must say that before I started that I had also

184
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,790
already studied acupuncture which I also used within the hospital.

185
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,800
And so acupuncture and homeopathy became the two ways by which were

186
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:39,290
possibilities for me to treat patients in an energetic level.

187
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:46,800
In 1990 together with a colleague we opened up a practice in Lansberg

188
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:54,050
I might have to add that during these 6 years I did not have any regular work, so I

189
00:21:54,150 --> 00:22:03,050
earned the money for my family with emergency doctor system, where I was working.

190
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:15,460
To make it clear [...] either with acupuncture or with homeopathy.

191
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:22,290
And I should also add that since 16 years now I live together with the wife of this pastor.

192
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:29,800
And she is the first person in my entire life who loves me the way I am and not for what

193
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:36,130
I should be.

194
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:50,130
I have taken Nat. mur. in C200 and 1M.That was about 5 years ago.

195
00:22:50,230 --> 00:23:08,640
And Bar. Carbonicum C1000 because many homeopaths said that many medical

196
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:14,330
doctors are Baryta carbonica.

197
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:23,880
I proved Lachesis quite intensively. I proved it and I developed a proving and I have

198
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,960
very intense images of snakes.

199
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,460
About 2 years ago I once took Psorinum 1M.

200
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:37,790
In November 1996 I had a severe coxitis on my right side and I had many Bryonia

201
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:42,790
symptoms, I took Bryonia and I was cured within 2 days.

202
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,550
Since then I haven't taken any other homeopathic remedy because I wanted to be

203
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:51,050
very sure not to take anything else before I come to see you.

204
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,710
And that is also why when I had this severe bronchitis in February this year, I did not

205
00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:05,960
take any remedy.

206
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:27,980
-You never took Ignatia? -No.

207
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,750
It is so that I have reached a point now where I feel that my clear mental calculation

208
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:44,310
is beginning to suffer.

209
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:52,150
-Did you have any otitis as a child?

210
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,650
-I think once.

211
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,160
-Do you perspire a lot?

212
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:07,150
-There were times where I perspired strongly also at night and what I might also add

213
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:13,150
is that I suffer a lot from insomnia but maybe it's because also of my profession which

214
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,650
often included many sleepless nights.

215
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:24,650
It's now so that I'm mostly awake between 4-5 a.m. and I must go to bed before

216
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,470
11-11.30 p.m. at night to be able to fall asleep.

217
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:37,970
If I go to bed later than midnight, I usually can't fall asleep anymore.

218
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:52,390
-If he perspires, does he feel uncomfortable with the perspiration or he feels good?

219
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:54,870
-It's not unpleasant.

220
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,790
-Where is the place you perspire first?

221
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:16,710
-Usually on my chest and partially also face.

222
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:27,370
-He never got again boils? At what age did they stop coming out?

223
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:33,870
-It was when I was 24 years old, it stopped then. I also wanted to add that these

224
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:39,840
severe purulent boils of the lymph nodes, I developed about half a year after the

225
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:47,790
death of my mother and the boiles I had on my buttocks, I developed 6-7 months

226
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:53,420
after my cousin had shot himself.

227
00:26:53,890 --> 00:27:01,890
Probably was my luck that through this I was able to mentally develop my life.

228
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:18,040
-Is he clairvoyant? There are other things which are happening and he has a

229
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,540
premonition about them?

230
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:33,620
-Only in the hospital.

231
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,620
-Still he can not stand?

232
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,120
-It's got better but let me give you an example. When I was still studying, when we

233
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:50,360
went to the theater to a concert once for a while, all we could afford was the place

234
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:59,860
where it was standing, we had no chair and every time I did this I actually had no joy.

235
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,110
I could not enjoy the concert or the theater play because of the pains I was suffering

236
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,110
during that time.

237
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:13,710
-Temperature wise, he is very warm, very cold in his body?

238
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:22,790
-I like warm. This question is very difficult to answer for me but I can definitely tell you

239
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:29,040
that in a room which is overheated, I can not stand, I have to open the windows.

240
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:36,040
And I love the shade more. I lie in the sun for 1-2 hour but never longer.

241
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,790
-What about his feet? Cold, hot?

242
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,540
-Feet are always warm.

243
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,290
-Does he stick them out of covers?

244
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:50,790
-Seldom.

245
00:28:50,890 --> 00:29:00,290
-I perceived that during telling his case, many times tears came and he wanted to

246
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:08,800
cry but he managed to control it. He never cries in other situations?

247
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,290
-I can cry yes.

248
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:16,210
-It's difficult.

249
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:20,710
-It was very difficult but maybe also due to Nat. mur. it's got easier.

250
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:31,750
-Also during all this case, he was sighing. Is this something he realized?

251
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,270
-I sigh every now and then again.

252
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,740
-Outside of this he is sighing also?

253
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,240
-Yes.

254
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:54,070
-He had to stop talking before he couldn't control himself. Did he feel any constriction in

255
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,820
the throat area?

256
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:02,070
-Constriction no. A certain kind of dryness.

257
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:10,520
The main reason why I interrupted talking was to find the correct words.

258
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,070
-Not because of too many emotions?

259
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:24,820
-Of course also but I had 10 days here now these 10 days were a bad time for me.

260
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:36,820
-Because he was preparing himself?

261
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:44,570
-Yes. Preparing for the talk with you and since I wanted to say my entire story without

262
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:50,830
skipping anything, I really had to dig again and I dug some feelings which I actually

263
00:30:50,930 --> 00:31:02,570
had already set aside and to tell you the truth entirely, I had to go through many things.

264
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,070
-During sleep does he have any salivation?

265
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,610
-Never.

266
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,820
-Does he eat fruits?

267
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:18,320
-I do eat fruits not so much but for example here now I like to eat grapes and I do eat

268
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,520
fruit but I'm not a fruit eater.

269
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,990
-What he likes to eat mostly?

270
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:29,240
-Actually I eat everything because that's how I was brought up but I like very much fish

271
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:33,370
I also like meat.

272
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,870
-Fat of meat?

273
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:41,700
-I eat it yes. I usually don't cut it off. I have a special aversion and that's aversion to

274
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:51,050
butter milk. I couldn't really say sour milk. Butter milk is the remain after making butter.

275
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,640
The liquid that is left over, that's what the butter milk is.

276
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:06,800
-Does he think that the death of his mother left guilt feelings in him?

277
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:16,280
-Yes for many years of course. During all school time I had really hard problems of

278
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:21,280
passing my final exams because during the entire time, more or less, wasn't really

279
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:29,530
there, wasn't really present and it was a hard time and actually my life begun to

280
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,530
become easier after I had left school and when I started studying.

281
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:36,240
That was the first time I felt some kind of personal liberty.

282
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,870
-When he went to the University?

283
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:47,140
-Yes. It just gave me the possibility to orientate myself anew.

284
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,870
-He became a good student?

285
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:53,180
-Yes.

286
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,260
-The sensitivity to wool is still there?

287
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:02,760
-I still have this itching after water. It's not so severe in the ocean but I could never

288
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:12,280
enter a public bath because already the slightest additive to water brings intolerable

289
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:24,000
itching.

290
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,840
-Does he grind his teeth during sleep?

291
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:34,100
-I don't think so, my wife never told me anything like this.

292
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,610
-How is his desire for sweets?

293
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,200
-I like to eat sweets once in a while, chocolates and cake but it's not a pronounced

294
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,310
desire, it's not that I have to have sweets, except chocolate.

295
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:48,640
Chocolate, I eat one of these bars at one time.

296
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,870
-How much thirst?

297
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,970
-Basically I do not have much thirst but they are situations where I develop more thirst

298
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,360
but in every day life I'm more thirsty.

299
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:04,460
-Eggs?
-I like to eat.

300
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,690
-Does he have any fears?

301
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:17,690
-I'm afraid of deep water. It's difficult for me because I actually trained myself to drive out

302
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:24,770
my fears. I do up into mountains and I climb great heights but you could say there is

303
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:31,940
a kind of fear of heights which still remains.

304
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:40,190
For example the Bernina which goes down very steep, right and left, I couldn't walk that.

305
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:44,940
-There is any anxiety about children?

306
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,530
-When my children were not at home I had terrible anxiety. I could not fall asleep

307
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:53,270
before they returned at home.

308
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,130
-Does he have children with his second wife?

309
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:06,940
-No, we don't have children. She had two children and for me that of course was

310
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:13,970
very difficult time because I never, never intended to set myself between the children

311
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,970
and father and of course during those times they were problems arising and suffering

312
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:27,970
and so on it was not easy but in the end I think it was the right way to go.

313
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,880
I actually have a good relationship now to both of those children and the one son

314
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:38,630
said to me the other day that actually he feels very lucky and happy that was able to

315
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:44,880
grow up in the Community of his mother and me, preferable of growing up in the

316
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,570
Community of his father.

317
00:35:48,670 --> 00:36:02,080
If I may add something concerning my own children.

318
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,070
going on with my wife and me, I'm more or less left them with her.

319
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:13,080
Because I never wanted to pull them into this situation between her and me and these

320
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:21,580
arguments and quarrels and I wanted them to have at least one stable home, a place

321
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,830
where they could be and I visited them but they live with my wife.

322
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:35,400
Now 2-3 years ago with all 3 of them I had very good and very deep talks and I was able

323
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,410
to explain everything from those times and they told me all their feelings and what had

324
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,650
happened and we really worked it out well.

325
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:46,980
I just want to say that I love them all 3 very much and they are just really wonderful

326
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,570
daughters.

327
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:54,330
-His ex-wife married to this priest?

328
00:36:54,430 --> 00:37:01,570
-No. Already at that time my wife discovered that I would be the better man after all

329
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:18,570
I could have changed that anymore.

330
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:25,070
-His father died from brain stroke?

331
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,070
-Hemorrhage of the brain.

332
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:30,400
-At what age?

333
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:38,980
-37.

334
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,980
-How does he know it was hemorrhage of the brain?

335
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:47,730
-I know from my mother and I also heard it from other doctors and professors.

336
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:52,510
Even though my father was very young in age, he was very reknown doctor and

337
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:57,820
he had a leading position in one of the Munich hospitals and I just think that during

338
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,920
the war probably most of us today can not imagine what it means if hundreds of people

339
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:10,900
are brought at the same time and what the surgeons of those times really did for hours

340
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,150
and hours. They were working until they just fell over but of course they were many

341
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:26,230
not only my father and I just assume it was too much for him on those years.

342
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:35,400
-Was any of these remedies found that helped him?

343
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,900
-I think what probably helped most was Nat. mur. but I only took it once.

344
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,150
I was treating myself but actually I didn't want to treat myself.

345
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:50,150
What I definitely didn't want to do was to try 20 remedies and see which one does

346
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:56,070
something. So I told myself not more than 1 remedy per year and just whether it does

347
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,400
something or not.

348
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:06,150
I was clear that homeopathic treatment would have to do with my life and I never

349
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,400
It was difficult for me to bring myself to this point.

350
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,230
wanted to surrender these details of my life with anyone and as you can imagine

351
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:20,520
it was really difficult but also at the same time for me I am very happy now that I was

352
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:26,730
able to tell you Mr Vithoulkas and also in front of the class.

353
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:34,650
but as I told you at that time my decision already was made and there was no way

354
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:39,290
-Yes sure. Thank you.

355
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:02,300
-I would like to analyze this case and to discuss a little bit about it.

356
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:14,910
I want to first give you some of my thoughts and then you can decide what is the remedy.

357
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:49,320
I must say that this was one of the most painful cases because it was very sincere.

358
00:40:50,330 --> 00:41:10,190
It came out of real feelings and it was very difficult for him primarily and of course for us as well

359
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:16,020
because either you want it or not you participate in the feelings.

360
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:27,690
And you feel all this energy which goes inside and Uta was telling me, I was collapsing

361
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,870
trying to translate.

362
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:45,120
I would say that very seldom we have the opportunity to hear the real truth.

363
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:53,190
We try to more or less understand what is going on but if somebody has been through

364
00:41:53,290 --> 00:42:02,630
this kind of grief to come out and confess it, it's very difficult.

365
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:09,690
And it took a lot of courage and he must have taken a lot of thinking and days and days

366
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:14,870
of thinking before he could do that. I don't know, I believe.

367
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:33,450
This is very instructive and very good for the class because it was exemplify in my

368
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:43,030
understanding certain things which are going on in Homeopathy and how do we deal

369
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,300
with it and what is priority?

370
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,630
You were asking how do you recognize this layer and that layer?

371
00:42:53,130 --> 00:43:02,950
This is a case where definitely one remedy is not going to do the whole treatment.

372
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:11,360
Yet it appears to be clear and yet it's not clear and I will give you my thoughts

373
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,210
concerning the case.

374
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:22,700
When he sat down and he said, I have 3 problems. You remember he said

375
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:43,110
vulnerability and then he said, the second is weakness and the third is the inner enemy,

376
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:51,130
an emptiness. I wrote down the remedy.

377
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:55,870
-Mercury?
-Mercury, very good.

378
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:09,790
This kind of vulnerability, we have spoken about Mercury, they are very vulnerable.

379
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:16,360
They can not face the world and finally they come to the conclusion that the whole

380
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:21,800
world is an enemy, they see an enemy all around etc.

381
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:30,950
And there is this weakness and there is the difficulty in speaking and expressing

382
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:38,030
themselves. I said well, that's it.

383
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:44,130
And then the case progresses and as the case progresses I wrote down another remedy.

384
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,160
-Ignatia?

385
00:44:48,870 --> 00:45:01,960
-No, I did not write Ignatia. Somebody said it, Sulphur.

386
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:17,120
Worse standing. When he said it was very difficult for me to stand for 5 minutes.

387
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:25,020
Even for 5 minutes to stand, I wrote down, not only for that reason but because of

388
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:40,800
another reason standing combined with water bringing this itching and furuncles.

389
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:59,000
Sulphur is the main remedy for repeated furuncles, they come here, they come there.

390
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:16,620
And then as he was going deeper into this state and analysis, I said oh my god he must

391
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,950
have taken Ignatia because he was constantly sighing.

392
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:32,200
Then the idea of Ignatia came because of this grief and then he described exactly

393
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,750
the way that I have described Aurum to you.

394
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:48,310
I have described how the Aurum patients take the car and they just drive against

395
00:46:48,410 --> 00:47:02,240
the tree, just out of despair and commit suicide or jumping from a high place.

396
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:14,330
Definitely at this moment we have in his life the layer which is uppermost, is Aurum.

397
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,570
So we have Mercury, Ignatia, Sulphur and Aurum.

398
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:35,310
And he took Nat. mur. very good. What shall we do now? Shall we start with the Aurum?

399
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:40,940
Shall we start with Ignatia, Mercury or Sulphur?

400
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:48,410
And this is the question we have to solve at this moment.

401
00:47:50,910 --> 00:48:01,220
Aurum, is he still Aurum? There was a layer which was Aurum?

402
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:06,560
We have said many times that Aurum he really means suicide.

403
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:15,310
When he tries to commit suicide, he really means that, he really wants to finish his life.

404
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:24,720
He is not trying to get out. He planned it. The first time I heard so clearly.

405
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:34,350
I planned it, I just wanted it and also I didn't want to give bad feelings to others or responsibilities.

406
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:46,150
So if you have him as a patient, during that time, you plan it you say forget it my life is

407
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:57,420
finished and once they find themselves in a high place, they just jump.

408
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:05,230
I told you about the case in Las Vegas. He telephoned one night that man.

409
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:18,150
He said, I will commit suicide tonight. I said how? He said, I will jump from this high place.

410
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:28,050
In Las Vegas there are some very steep rocks, 50-100 meters. He said, I will jump from there,

411
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:33,640
tonight and then I said to him, can you change it for tomorrow morning?

412
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:43,960
He was serious, it was not like this, my heart was going like this.

413
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:53,540
He was just informing me because my student, a medical doctor had made and affair

414
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,150
with his wife.

415
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:09,630
And therefore it was my fault because we had been in his house together with this

416
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:17,730
student of mine who had an affair with his wife.

417
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:32,910
So I was also in his mind responsible. What kind of students do you have and all this blaming.

418
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:37,510
He said to me that he had planned all that.

419
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:44,350
Of course it was time lapsed. By the time we went to his house and the time he decided

420
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:52,280
to commit suicide, there was an affair going on with this doctor and his wife.

421
00:50:53,370 --> 00:51:02,700
So he was telling me actually that this was his decision but I should know why and that

422
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,070
was the reason.

423
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:18,760
I said, would you do me a favor? Because I was very nice with him. I had treated him

424
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:28,680
and I've been to his house and met him and we discussed and I was supposed to treat

425
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:37,780
him if he needed something, I would provide. He was very nice, we were friendly.

426
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:51,100
And he said OK but you have to know that this is the reason and he has done all he had

427
00:51:51,200 --> 00:52:03,450
to do with his lawyer, made his will, what will happen afterwards.

428
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:13,930
Of course in Berkley and he was in Las Vegas and he was telephoning me that in a few

429
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:18,110
hours I just commit suicide, you have to know why?

430
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:25,950
Then what could I do? I said, can you wait until morning, do me a favor, last favor.

431
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:33,970
Wait until tomorrow. He said OK tomorrow morning.

432
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:44,110
Then I said, will you please take this remedy and if you want to commit suicide by tomorrow, you do it.

433
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:48,210
There is no question but do me this favor, take this remedy.

434
00:52:49,040 --> 00:53:00,370
I called his wife who was still with him and I said, give him a dose of Aurum CM.

435
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:05,020
You have Aurum CM? Yes. Give it to him now. He took it.

436
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:14,750
Next morning he telephoned, next afternoon. He said, I have decided not to commit suicide.

437
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:24,650
This man died 10 years ago by falling from his helicopter.

438
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:34,490
His helicopter broke down and he had an accident. He died from a fall.

439
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:47,390
But anyhow this suddenly will develop an Aurum situation. You have to give it.

440
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:58,400
Now the question we have with this man, with all this deep, unbelievable grief and

441
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:15,060
putting on him all this guilt, grief and guilt, because of his father, his mother and then

442
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,720
because of his wife of course.

443
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:22,250
You can imagine, she changed her mind, no, no I love you.

444
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:34,770
No, now it's too late and all this guilt. Is this still an Aurum case? This is what we have to solve.

445
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:54,730
Or the layer of Aurum has gone, through what?

446
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:05,490
-Through Nat. mur.?
-No, I don't think.

447
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:32,740
Actually this layer was counteracted by a very intense inner action.

448
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:53,570
It was a homeopathic nullification of this level like auto therapy, when they take blood

449
00:55:53,670 --> 00:56:04,800
and they inject it again back. Most probably this level left.

450
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:17,180
So therefore we are left with 3 possibilities. The Mercury, Sulphur and Ignatia.

451
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,420
Does anybody has any other idea?

452
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:33,500
-Nat. sulp.
-Staphysagria.

453
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:55,120
-I think the layer is already gone because he says he has a very healthy relationship

454
00:56:55,220 --> 00:57:00,360
with the woman 16 years already and that she is the only person that took him the

455
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:06,470
way he is and in this way she loves him. So I think no more Aurum.

456
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:21,120
-I think one time he would need, not now but later. He will need also Carcinosin. His mother had

457
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:34,190
pernicious anemia and his father died very early and if he had all the symptoms of Carcinosin...

458
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:43,120
-I don't know but you like Carcinosin and every time comes to your mind.

459
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:57,260
-What about Arsenicum? I know that you are telling me it feels hot but last September

460
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,280
was sitting here, he didn't let us open the windows

461
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:10,010
-Never mind last September. Now he says, he is feeling warm. He thought about it and

462
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:16,200
he said when I am in a warm room, I don't feel comfortable.

463
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:26,070
And Arsenicum will say, when I am in a warm room, I feel very comfortable.

464
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:37,080
What is your idea?

465
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:47,220
-How is it with the physical injuries he had, with the axe what he told and

466
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:59,340
with what he had when he was in anesthesia and he said he was in a big tube

467
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,500
and he was stuck with It. was his first thing he said.

468
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:08,360
-That was an experience.

469
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,110
-What about all shocks that he had, one after another?

470
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:23,900
-He had a series of grief and a series of very strong events in his life.

471
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:33,610
There comes and his father is dead and there comes and somebody shoots himself.

472
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:39,000
The moment he is happy, he has finished his study, he comes there and finds somebody

473
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:47,000
who dies in his lap and his mother commit suicide and leaves a letter.

474
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:55,350
That is really very deep because there is a connection, you are connected.

475
00:59:55,450 --> 01:00:05,490
You can not forget. Try to forget this event, how? I don't see how you can forget.

476
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:14,070
So that state is a deep grief inside and guilt feelings and grief.

477
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:19,570
So there is any question that there is grief in him? No.

478
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:28,490
The relationship which he has with his wife now, whom he loves, he found somebody

479
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:33,570
with whom they have a very good rapport.

480
01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:40,040
That relationship takes away a lot of problems, there is no question.

481
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:48,490
But can this relationship take away all the grief because if it can take all the grief away,

482
01:00:52,030 --> 01:01:03,290
then we are justified to go to purely physical symptomatology and see which remedy fits.

483
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:12,190
All the grief is out because of a good relationship? What's your impression?

484
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:13,730
-No.

485
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:23,830
-So the grief is still there. Therefore we are going to deal first with the grief.

486
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:35,320
First we are going to deal with the grief? It's Aurum, Staphysagria, Ignatia, Nat. mur.?

487
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:37,740
-Ignatia.

488
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:56,810
-It's Ignatia, why? Because you see this deep sighing constantly.

489
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:10,890
That's what when we described the remedies, this is how we described Ignatia.

490
01:02:18,890 --> 01:02:28,720
And not crying. He can cry but you see how he control the crying?

491
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:38,540
He needed a lot of power to control the crying because it is his remedy to control

492
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:43,640
the crying; otherwise why he should control?

493
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:57,620
Somebody else will cry but he didn't feel comfortable in crying, in spite of that

494
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:03,570
tremendous grief, in spite of the fact he was confessing this grief and digging

495
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:21,960
inside his soul. All this grief coming back, again relieving every point and you could

496
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:29,710
see he was not detached, a person who was relating about the grief.

497
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:41,790
He was living the grief, he was one with the grief. So the grief is there alive.

498
01:03:41,890 --> 01:03:54,140
Then we have to deal first with this grief and then we go deeper.

499
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:59,800
The remedy which is indicated...

500
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:23,880
This is interesting. Ignatia, Mercury, Sulphur the 3 remedies we have been thinking are

501
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:35,390
prominent, 3 prominent remedies actually. Aurum, Pulsatilla, Natr. mur.

502
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:57,900
So therefore as the case unfolds and you are searching for the right remedy at this

503
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:05,110
moment, you can not say I'm going to give him Sulphur because you see the life grief.

504
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:11,530
The grief is there because in spite of the fact he has a good relationship, in spite of the

505
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:20,190
fact he talks with his children and they talk it out, this is not enough for the organism.

506
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:33,290
The organism has been wound deeply and needs the homeopathic remedy to bring

507
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:38,130
some kind of balance on that level.

508
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:46,370
The Ignatia will bring a kind of a balance to a certain level and then underneath

509
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:50,710
what will be the remedy underneath?

510
01:05:55,410 --> 01:06:08,130
Who says Sulphur? Who says Mercury? Who says another remedy?

511
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:22,870
My idea is this. Many times Ignatia is complemented by Sulphur.

512
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:30,040
You have to remember this. Ignatia many times is followed well by Sulphur.

513
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:39,710
Now in this case we have too many symptoms of Sulphur to be able to ignore them.

514
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:51,190
Vertigo high places, worse heat, aggravation from water, itching from water, wool

515
01:06:51,290 --> 01:07:02,370
aggravates, also aggravates the Mercury. All these are keynotes of Sulphur.

516
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:30,290
Emptiness in the stomach is also a keynote for Ignatia. All gone feeling in the stomach.

517
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:39,250
As the case unfolds from Mercury to Sulphur, to Aurum, to Ignatia, you say wait a moment,

518
01:07:39,350 --> 01:07:43,840
what potency?

519
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,230
-Very high.

520
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:56,580
-Very high, 50M, CM. You give and you can repeat it also.

521
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:08,570
50M 2 times, CM 2 times 5 days. In 5 days he must take a deep breath and the

522
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:18,830
organism will forget most of the grief. This grief is never going to be forgotten totally.

523
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:20,940
Don't make a mistake.

524
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:23,010
-Why 5 times?

525
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:41,010
-Because the grief is 5 times, multiplied by 5. Put any grief, multiply by 5 and this is

526
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:53,280
the case. It's very deeply rooted, tremendously. It's unbelievable.

527
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:04,340
It's one of the most dramatic cases I have encountered, as far as relating the cases concerned.

528
01:09:06,340 --> 01:09:14,240
To be able to give out this information in front of the class...

529
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:23,100
If there was a psychiatrist here would say, well this was a healing experience.

530
01:09:24,810 --> 01:09:35,210
Forget it, not in his case. Because he has done it already with his wife, with his children.

531
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:37,640
The grief did not go away.

532
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:44,450
-George I think that he was able to do this in front of the class, shows how deep he suffers.

533
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:55,110
-Also the preparation he needed. The psychological preparation, he must be

534
01:09:55,210 --> 01:10:01,810
torturing himself, he must have thought again and again how shall I say, what shall

535
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:11,650
I say? He wrote it down to be able to stick to the facts and you could see the

536
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:21,240
trembling when the whole organism was in a state of turmoil.

537
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:25,580
-I think that Aurum layer will come up again.

538
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:36,810
-I don't think, no. Taking the way his life is at the moment. God help if something else

539
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:43,320
happens, I don't know but in this way, no. The way I see the situation, no.

540
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:50,080
-Do you then say this was an acute? This Aurum was an acute?

541
01:10:50,180 --> 01:11:02,390
-Exactly, it was a layer added which changed the layer of let us say, Sulphur or it might be Mercury.

542
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:15,160
Maybe this case is Ignatia and then Sulphur and then Mercury.

543
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:20,160
And there was a time where he needed Mercury and Sulphur.

544
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:51,130
Aurum I should put it here. This was counteracted by itself, by the fact and then

545
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:55,900
Ignatia stayed and then Sulphur and then Mercury.

546
01:11:57,770 --> 01:12:04,770
I think this is the way is going to do but he will feel much better after Sulphur.

547
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:11,770
The big amelioration for him will come, will be another person.

548
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:22,910
-And when you do get to the Sulphur, will also be a high potency?

549
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:32,500
-Yes, not a very high like this. Ignatia is the level of grief and the level of grief is deep

550
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:38,190
and strong and embedded inside. He has permeated all his cells.

551
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:49,940
To unroot that it's a miracle because it might have been so deep that you can not

552
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:58,040
even see it. But now all this pointed out to us.

553
01:12:59,790 --> 01:13:05,800
-Mr Vithoulkas I was almost in the way of these things except the one tone.

554
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:13,190
The tone to the Aurum, maybe from my mistakes some other people can learn also.

555
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:21,520
I thought about Nat. Sulphuricum because he planned this act so detailed and he

556
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:26,510
didn't want to bring the harm to the relatives and that was a key issue in all this

557
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:30,120
discussion and so together with the symptom of waking at 4-5 a.m., could you please

558
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:36,760
bring a little bit light to my mistake? Thank you.

559
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:44,670
-Have we talked about Aurum?

560
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:53,950
-We talked about Aurum the first lesson. I described the way they commit suicide.

561
01:13:54,050 --> 01:14:04,780
One of the ways is taking the car and hit it against the tree.

562
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:18,110
This, the Nat. sulph. they don't commit suicide because they think of the others.

563
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:24,030
The grief they are going to inflict on others, prevents them from committing suicide

564
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:28,950
though they think all the time, I want to die, I want to die.

565
01:14:29,050 --> 01:14:38,780
No, you must not die, you have a daughter. No, this is not life. All this time, this fight.

566
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:46,300
This fight we don't see and then they hang themselves. Usually Nat. sulp...

567
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:51,680
-I just remembered the story you told us about Nat. sulph. in one of your cases.

568
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:58,920
When you treat some patient who was in grief because his wife died and he doesn't

569
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:06,590
want to harm his daughter. Is it the same, the wife like died because they divorced

570
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:11,600
and he doesn't want to bring this grief to the family.

571
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:18,140
So he planned it very well but at the same time he was just on anticipation...

572
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:24,230
-Planning suicide means finished, I don't want to live. My life is finished. They jump.

573
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:30,700
They take the car under this condition and they hit the tree.
