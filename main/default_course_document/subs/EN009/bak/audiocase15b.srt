00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,890
-In regards to the teeth grinding, have you any idea whether there is a particular part of

2
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,650
the night that you grind your teeth more?

3
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,220
-No I don't know but I know when I''m stressed, I grind them more.

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,980
-In relation to food desires, is there any particular relation between chocolate and you?

5
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,890
-Yes, yes very strong.

6
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,550
-And that desire is it affected by your menstrual cycle?

7
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:55,230
-I wouldn't say so, although I've noticed that if I carbohydrate before my cycle,

8
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:00,980
like a week before, that it helps.

9
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,980
-You mentioned a couple of times that your sexual desire at different times in your life

10
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,840
was not that strong, has it ever got to the point that you actually had been averse,

11
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,310
that you pushed someone away.

12
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,730
-Not averse because it is averse to a person maybe.

13
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,440
-Or aversion from fatigue?

14
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,600
-Yes but I wouldn't use the word aversion.

15
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,850
-I can't be bothered, I'm too tired?

16
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,770
-I'm too tired.
-Thank you.

17
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,460
-How you would completing the things you start?

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,850
-I'm getting better, I used to often not being able to complete what I started but because

19
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:11,440
I'm aware of it now, I make a point of doing it and unless it's ridiculous to continue.

20
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:14,970
-Do you often start many things?

21
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:25,360
-Yes, I use to work on many things at once like when I'm cleaning the house,

22
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,260
I try very much to focus on one room at the time but if I'm passing through somewhere else,

23
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll do something. I have to learn to focus.

24
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:46,260
She has been harassed and the defenses have been gone down and could not keep

25
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:53,550
anymore the acne, the trouble in the skin.

26
00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:02,350
This might not have happened during the time she was taking the antibiotics.

27
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:09,880
I feel that during that time, 50% of the problem was gone already

28
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:18,930
but the organism itself went down and then because of the harassment from the antibiotics,

29
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,820
the whole thing disappeared.

30
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:29,520
But it is the effect of the antibiotics which brings the organism to that state

31
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:36,240
where it cannot anymore bring out the eruption. If we now give the correct remedy,

32
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:44,860
she will start slowly having more and more pimples and more and more eruption,

33
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,820
which will show what? The defense is better because of the right remedy and then

34
00:03:51,920 --> 00:04:01,860
 the organism will remember what has to do when it is in a good state, to bring out an eruption.

35
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:16,160
-Didn't the eruption come out again stronger after she stopped the antibiotics?

36
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:23,520
-Yes, which again for me it is the same thing.

37
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:33,660
The defenses are down and then the eruption is a lot but the organism has been

38
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:40,690
weakened and eventually it withdraws.

39
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:48,160
-Have you purposefully ignored the herpes and the desire for chocolate?

40
00:04:48,260 --> 00:05:11,400
-Not purposefully but the desire for chocolate in this case, I do not give much weight.

41
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,080
I take it as the desire for sweets it is good enough.

42
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,490
The Repertory gives only two remedies for desire for chocolate

43
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:35,560
Hydrophobinum and Phosphorus.

44
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,350
-And Carcinosin and Sepia and Argentum nitricum.

45
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:50,140
-Yes but I'll tell you why I ignore it. Who likes chocolate really? Look.

46
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:58,560
And there are two remedies in the Repertory. Most of the people like chocolate.

47
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:06,060
Therefore in a case like that I will not base my prescription on the desire for chocolate.

48
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:14,140
That is one reason why I ignore it. The second you ask is why herpes?

49
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:32,560
Herpes is a periodic manifestation and you say I ignore it but I don't.

50
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:46,600
Herpes is a condition which can be produced by half of the Materia Medica.

51
00:06:51,820 --> 00:07:01,890
Not there but if you look all the chapters where herpes are mentioned and you count the remedies,

52
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,740
it will be half of the Materia Medica.

53
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:14,410
So if there are so many remedies that can produce herpes, how herpes differentiate

54
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:25,730
for me this or that remedy? It is very difficult on the strength of the herpes to differentiate.

55
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:44,040
Vaginal herpes. You want to differentiate on that.

56
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:56,800
She said that they told her it is herpes but she could not see anything.

57
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,160
-Is that what you said?

58
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,130
-I'm sorry, I missed the question.

59
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:10,880
-You said that they told you, you had herpes but you could not see anything.

60
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:17,330
-I did but there was never confirmed, there was never actual test that showed that it was positive.

61
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:28,580
It was a doctor who said it looks like it could be and since that time I never had any problems with it.

62
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:38,570
-So you have something which is not really defined.

63
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:46,780
-Most patient similar to her could have come for menstrual difficulties rather than fatigue.

64
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,360
She said that she has terrible cramps that started since the age of 13, at the same time of acne.

65
00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:02,430
So probably the same remedy interesting for her initial, would be interesting

66
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,930
also for her menstrual cramps and other disorders.

67
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:12,340
Like that we don't have anything in our rubrics concerning her menstruation and

68
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,590
concerning short periods or any other characteristics.

69
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:29,180
-We can take into consideration. What you would like to look in the Repertory concerning her menses?

70
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,210
What symptom you would like to look?

71
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,710
-I don't have many information about her menstruation. I don't know whether she gets

72
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:44,800
hot flashes, whether her sex drive tends to be better or not, whether she gets craving or not,

73
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:52,510
whether her perspiration is different
or not?

74
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:59,350
-She said that before menses she gets upset and she gets all kinds of psychological

75
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,350
but you can tell.

76
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:08,770
-Two, three days before I start I get very, very tired and at first day I feel terrible, when

77
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:16,350
it starts and I wish I could stay at home. It's cramping and irritability and bloating and all

78
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,800
the usual things.

79
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:25,040
-What you want to put into the Repertory out of what she said?

80
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:35,180
-Not very much so far but I wonder if it is important to investigate more on that.

81
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:45,930
-To investigate more? We investigated. Don't push something which is not there?

82
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:54,630
By putting questions and questions and pushing it's not going to take you very far

83
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,850
because she said exactly, three days tired before menses. You can use that.

84
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:13,960
Do we have this? Weakness before menses? Let me see the rubric.

85
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,260
-Weakness yes.

86
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,260
-She said weakness three days before menses and the day during menses

87
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:48,690
she becomes very irritated and crampy. Show me irritability during menses.

88
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:53,630
-Actually I take a prescription for it.

89
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,500
-What do you take?

90
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,630
-Anoprox.

91
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,630
-What is this?

92
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:09,830
-Anoprox is anti-inflammatory for the cramps. They are quite severe.

93
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,710
-Cramps where, in the lower abdomen?

94
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,330
-Yes.

95
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:19,880
-Cramps on the lower abdomen during menses.

96
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:29,550
The irritability is only one day, the first day or it is during the whole menses?

97
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:38,130
-It's maybe the day before and the first day.

98
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:55,750
-Here we have bone aching, dull pain, cramping pain during menses. Cocculus, Sulphur.

99
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:12,490
-She also said that she gets radiation.

100
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,130
-When she is menstruating does she have a feeling of a symptom with pressure down?

101
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,290
-No, she said no.

102
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:45,190
-During menstruation do you have the feeling that everything will come out?

103
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,220
The intestines will come out?

104
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:56,110
-No but I feel like point downwards, it's not like the intestines are coming out.

105
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:01,390
I feel like there is a pressure pulling down, like gravity.

106
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,110
-She has a gravity.

107
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:11,310
-When she coughs, sneezes or laughs does she lose any water?

108
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:20,200
-No I don't.

109
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:40,460
-Going back to her constipation would she be able to describe the feeling in the rectum?

110
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,490
I'm looking for a keynote.

111
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,040
-You are looking for what?

112
00:14:49,140 --> 00:15:00,710
-No, no.

113
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:08,210
-That's the French part of me coming out.

114
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:14,880
-If you are constipated, do you have any particular feeling in the rectum?

115
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:29,490
-C'est tres lourd. It just feels like I have cement in my gut and my stomach feels hard.

116
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,490
-Like concrete.

117
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,990
-Yes.

118
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:46,370
-Do you have this feeling in the abdomen pulling down?

119
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:12,700
Not during menses.

120
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:21,540
Dragging, bearing down in abdomen.

121
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:37,820
During menses she says.

122
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:59,130
Secale, Platina, Pulsatilla, Lilium tigrinum.

123
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:08,880
Now what you will do? Here is dragging, bearing down during menses.

124
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,300
Do you have any palpitations?

125
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:21,060
-Not that stands on my mind.

126
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:33,480
-I just like to ask because in my mind it keeps coming back Sepia in this case.

127
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:39,680
You tend to dismiss Sepia here because she did not seem to have the emotional state of Sepia

128
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:46,210
but it's been my experience that in this modern world for some reason,

129
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:51,600
the Sepia type being more the workaholic female.

130
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,930
That you don't tend to take the kind of emotional symptoms, as clearly as you might,

131
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:03,000
when you read  in the Materia Medica. So if I set that aside and I certainly had

132
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,750
a couple of patients who fit that kind of picture and that may be a prejudice in my mind to some degree

133
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,910
but the rest of the symptomatology seems to me that suggests very strongly Sepia,

134
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:17,380
although I agree there is a strong element of Silica there as well.

135
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:24,120
-As we have seen from the repertorization, Sepia was coming as one of the first remedies,

136
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,620
first or second remedy all the time, which means a lot of her symptomatology,

137
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,990
there is no question, it is covered by Sepia.

138
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,740
Here it's very interesting - I'll make the comments in the end - how we make the

139
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:52,350
differentiation in the case where we have two or three remedies that come with quiet a lot

140
00:18:52,450 --> 00:19:04,070
of symptomatology, all of them. How do we differentiate one from the other?

141
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:11,690
-I keep wondering if the dragging or bearing down sensation is in the uterus

142
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:16,740
or rather in the abdomen?

143
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,740
-I don''t know if she knows so much anatomy but we'll see.

144
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,990
-I think it's the uterus.

145
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,740
-You feel it's bearing down.

146
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:43,990
-When you say you have a sensation of bearing down, pulling down, is this in the whole

147
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,650
of lower abdomen or it is the uterus? Can you differentiate that?

148
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:53,270
-No, I can't.

149
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:17,490
-What is the bearing down? Sepia, Pulsatilla, Lilium tigrinum, Belladonna.

150
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:23,570
-I think what we need to do here is to go back to over all the symptoms that we gathered

151
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:29,160
and to read them according to their characteristics, their spontaneity, their essence

152
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:36,150
and pick up the top 6 to 8 symptoms that we think are key,

153
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,690
so that we are not getting lost in the details and go from there.

154
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,030
-Very good.

155
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,200
This is a very good observation.

156
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,190
You see what happened in the class, I let it run like this.

157
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:00,560
So you asked questions, more questions, more questions. You reached her to the point

158
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,810
where she has bearing down feelings.

159
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:16,060
If that was prominent in her case, she would have mentioned it on the very beginning.

160
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:24,360
When she mentioned about her menses, she would have said not that I'm irritable and I have cramps.

161
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,190
She would say I have a bearing down sensation.

162
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:33,030
That would be the first thing to have said and then first things first.

163
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:38,600
Now by asking and asking and asking, you reach a point where she will say

164
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,600
yes I also have a bearing.

165
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:50,350
It's exactly an example which I gave you a few minutes ago.

166
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:57,600
Don't you have a bearing down sensation? Don't you feel something is pulling you down?

167
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:05,510
Well yes I also have that but what she has said in the beginning? We have the video and

168
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,460
we can go back and look.

169
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,930
When she talks about the menses, she says three days before the menses I'm exhausted,

170
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:26,260
I'm very tired and during the first day of the menses I'm cramping and I feel miserable,

171
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,510
I don't want to go to work.

172
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:43,840
She did not say for her to be or to rely upon that symptom and go and say this is a case of Sepia,

173
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:51,760
since you don't have the aversion to sex or the lack of orgasm and you want to rely

174
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,760
on the bearing down sensation, it has to be strong.

175
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:04,090
This is what I spoke in the beginning. A symptom has to have intensity,

176
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:18,350
has to have continuity, has to have depth and has to have also uniqueness.

177
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:25,260
This symptom lacks the intensity.

178
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,760
If you keep on asking questions, you will bring out 1000 more symptoms and you will say

179
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:37,630
what about this and what about that and there is another one.

180
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:44,890
I can make it as a test in another case if you want and you will see how many more

181
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:51,130
symptoms we can gather and gather and pages and pages of symptoms.

182
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,050
Then what you do with them. Then you have to focus to what?

183
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:08,630
She said something which is very strong and important and when did she say that?

184
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:16,420
In the beginning. Not that this case is not Sepia because it looks like Sepia,

185
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:24,130
it looks like Silica, it looks like Psorinum but we have to differentiate between the three

186
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:27,880
and come down to one conclusion.

187
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:35,050
There is definitely from the repertorization we see Sepia appearing,

188
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:39,920
we see Silica appearing, we see Psorinum appearing.

189
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:51,290
This is our job now to differentiate, to go back and say what does she look like?

190
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:55,040
-What about Psorinum? We considered a number of differential, we haven't really talked

191
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,130
about that, she certainly seems to have a lot of Psorinum symptomatology and

192
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,640
some of them are keynotes. You were saying before what is the essence?

193
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:08,040
Coldness, she is freezing, she wears six sweaters in the winter, she can't go out without her hat on.

194
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,460
Is it not a strong Psorinum keynote?

195
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:19,220
-Right exactly, this is very good observation. You remember I asked her a keynote

196
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:25,630
of Psorinum because Psorinum they feel so cold and they feel aggravated by cold,

197
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:33,040
especially in the head, to the extent that they cannot go out in winter without a hat.

198
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:40,130
-But she is not wearing much today. She is wearing about the same as you.

199
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:45,880
-My nose is cold, my hands are cold. I don't know about my feet.

200
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,300
-I'm perspiring.

201
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,380
-All women are cold.

202
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,720
-No, I have a problem with being cold leg.

203
00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:01,380
-You wear only one shirt and she wears two, a jacket and a shirt.

204
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,000
-But most women, a lot of them are cold. It's not uncommon to hear that women

205
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,710
 are cold and chilly.

206
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:20,880
-Sometimes in the summer time when it's completely hot, I feel cold.

207
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,460
-She even said that she cannot sleep at night if the room is cold.

208
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:33,740
-She has a headache if the room is cold, she wakes in the night.

209
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,320
There is an aggravation definitely, which you cannot ignore.

210
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:53,820
-Is there a rubric for head pain cold, head getting cold at night?

211
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:00,680
You see her head becoming cold?

212
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,400
-I have to disagree. There are lots of women who are warm and who feel really, really hot.

213
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,980
So I don't think that all women are cold. I think that's a wrong observation.

214
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:32,790
By the way I just remember that I'm perspiring all the time, so why should I perspire?

215
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:49,870
Pain and getting cold, Belladonna, Sepia and Silica. Sepia again is coming quite strongly and Silica.

216
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:05,060
Here Psorinum has to be added by the way.

217
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:10,050
-In what degree?

218
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:17,190
-Psorinum at least italics, Psorinum is one of the main remedies.

219
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:24,560
Psorinum will sleep in the night with a hat because they get very cold in the head.

220
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:31,520
Also Silica, not so much Sepia. I have not seen it in Sepia.

221
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:43,030
I don't know it is in the original Kent? Sepia is capital.

222
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:59,520
-Are you aware of any aversion for hat with Silica because a homeopath told us that

223
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:05,230
Silica people generally have great aversion for hats.

224
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:10,270
-No, I do not know it.

225
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:25,530
We all agree that the choice is between Psorinum, Sepia and Silica. Which one?

226
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,940
-She is clairvoyant.

227
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,440
-Are you clairvoyant?

228
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,350
-Sometimes.

229
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,940
-In Boericke in the Psorinum it says phagocyte's defective which is interesting because

230
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:17,800
antibiotics cause granular cytosis, which means that your faculties don't work.

231
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,640
-I would like to know how you were before your menses started?

232
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:47,960
As a child, how was your energy level?

233
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:53,200
-Great.

234
00:30:53,300 --> 00:31:00,110
-Also as you were been brought up, nutrition wise what was your environment?

235
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:11,780
You were brought up in a good environment or poor environment?

236
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:24,400
-I think that we ate quite well. There was some junk food in there but pretty typical of what teenagers eat.

237
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:44,790
-I just want to find out if she's had Raynaud's, if she's had any thyroid panels done

238
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:53,280
because she is showing a lot of thyroid symptoms.

239
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:01,120
-Which disease? Raynaud's.

240
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,860
-Did you have any thyroid tests?

241
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,360
-I think so.

242
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,440
-Was anything wrong with your thyroid?

243
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,760
-No.

244
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:35,190
-In the Raynaud's disease there is freezing of the fingers and the toes and they go white.

245
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:54,520
-I''d like to know if she is perfectionist. She told us she would like to do more

246
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,360
but when she works, is she working extremely precisely?

247
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:05,210
-If she does, what you will do?

248
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:11,280
-I think it goes better with Silica. Silica people they are supposed to be excellent workers,

249
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:16,770
doing the best all the time, giving good results at work and the rest.

250
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:24,770
-Show me fear of death.

251
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:31,110
-In regard to that Sepias are also very artistic. That could be also in favor of Sepia.

252
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:38,440
Also I would like to know where  your eruptions were when you had the antibiotics

253
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,560
and before the antibiotics?

254
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,670
-On the face, the back and the buttocks.

255
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:49,600
-Anywhere specifically on your face?

256
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,110
-Forehead and chin.

257
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,940
-OK thank you.

258
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,360
-There was a time when you had fear of death. What age?

259
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,930
-Around 20 to 21.

260
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:38,270
-I'll tell you the solution, so everybody will be happy.

261
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:51,180
We'll give in the morning Sepia, in the noon Silica, in the afternoon Psorinum.

262
00:34:53,290 --> 00:35:03,100
Even for those who use polypharmacy, analyzing a case is so useful.

263
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,740
Once you do that, you have a possibility.

264
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:20,120
Well it's a difficult case, the decision is very difficult.

265
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,620
Especially the decision between Psorinum and Silica.

266
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:34,110
Sepia for her is a little bit more on the side.

267
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:48,990
I do not like the fact for instance that she does not have a perspiration which is offensive.

268
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:54,250
For Psorinum I would like to see that the perspiration was much more offensive

269
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:59,250
than she has accepted.

270
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,250
-Offensive perspiration on her feet?

271
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:19,590
-Only if I'm not wearing cotton, if I'm wearing nylons.

272
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:26,030
-Both Psorinum and Silica they have offensive perspiration and the perspiration of Silica is

273
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:37,080
many times acid and it spoils the shoes. Do you have that?

274
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,840
-No.

275
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,540
-Do you have any perspiration in the night in the head?

276
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,840
-Sometimes I sweat a lot at night but it's not often, it's every once in a while.

277
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,950
I wake up and my clothes are wet.

278
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:55,080
-You wake up sweat in the night?

279
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,670
-In the night.

280
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,750
-What time? First part of the night or you don't know?

281
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:06,420
-Right in the middle of the night.

282
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:18,920
-Perspiration in the night.

283
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:29,170
You see Sepia is quite strong in that.

284
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,660
Silica and Sepia, Sepia also.

285
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:48,500
Does she perspire so much as it appears here? No. Still the third degree?

286
00:37:48,600 --> 00:38:03,080
-Although Calcarea was not there. I didn't see Calcarea before.

287
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:24,500
-So her perspiration is rather of that order, not of this order. Not three underlines.

288
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:32,090
You would put 3-4 underlines in her perspiration? No, she said sometimes I perspire in the night.

289
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,330
Once in a while.

290
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:48,830
With this case to finish because I get the feedback that

291
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:55,020
we have analyzed for too long the case.

292
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:05,330
Why we have analyzed it too long? Because it is not clear and because

293
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:16,400
I, myself have not really decided on one or the other remedy and I keep on thinking all the time

294
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:25,080
that we have been analyzing the case. Where we should start?

295
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:42,240
My decision for starting the case will be Psorinum, with second possibility Silica.

296
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:49,820
In case Psorinum does not give an effect, then I have Silica as a second possibility

297
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,490
and then we can go ahead and give it.

298
00:39:52,590 --> 00:40:00,830
The reason for giving Psorinum first is because the trouble that

299
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:05,570
 starts the whole thing is an eruption.

300
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:16,230
Another reason is that Psorinum also like Sulphur is indicated with unclear cases where

301
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,350
we have not a clear cut picture.

302
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:39,010
So Psorinum is one of those remedies that go quite deeply and they change the constitution.

303
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:44,090
Show me Psorinum.

304
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:05,180
Also Psorinum has grinding of the teeth during sleep, which is interesting because though

305
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,990
it is not strong...

306
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,900
Psorinum has most of the symptomatology actually.

307
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:59,810
-What potency?
-200.

308
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:18,130
-OK, 200. Give her 200, 1M and 10M, morning, evening and night.

309
00:42:23,310 --> 03:01:30,970
One dose, one day, yes.
