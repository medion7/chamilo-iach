1
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:41,010
-George the last time you saw me I was in Berlin, it was in February of 1999.

2
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:47,180
At that time, I was taking Phosphorus C200 every day after the last attack

3
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,540
and felt quite well with it.

4
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,840
On the 20th of June, she developed new problems.

5
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:02,200
The cortisone dose had been reduced, up to that point down to 10 mg every day

6
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,140
and then the problems reappeared again.

7
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:13,540
But her blood examination was fine, nevertheless she had watery and bloody stool

8
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,270
about 4 times every night and twice during the day. Her energy went down,

9
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:29,270
she was living on her own by then already and told me that

10
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,020
she had more double checks than before.

11
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,810
-Again?

12
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,920
-And also her menstruation had become normal again since the beginning of the year.

13
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:45,180
Her cycle was 30 days, the menses lasted for 5 days every time,

14
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,060
it was completely without any problems, no pain, no nothing accompanying.

15
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,260
She was also doing fine at school, so actually she didn't know what could be the cause

16
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,650
of this new attack again. Where did it come from?

17
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:09,680
-Let me remind me something. When I first saw her, there was a stoppage for menses.

18
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,120
For how long?
-At least one year.

19
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,270
Due to the fact that diarrhea was mainly coming after midnight,

20
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,600
you prescribed Arsenicum album C6.

21
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,340
Besides that she was very chilly and had very low energy.

22
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,420
Two days later we raised the potency to C12 because C6 did not act.

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,170
In the meantime she also developed fever during the night, up to 40 degrees Celsius,

24
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,930
always after midnight.

25
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,720
And the main problem at that time was the menses pains she had when she had

26
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,070
the urge for stool. Strong pain.

27
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,960
-Strong pain in the abdomen?

28
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,690
-Especially on the left side, she was always pointing.

29
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,420
-This pain was there before, she can remember?

30
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,520
-I had it before but not that severe.

31
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,760
-When she had it before?

32
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:09,350
-Every time I had an attack, every time I had the urge to stool, this pain.

33
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,840
-The urge or the pain?

34
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,200
-Every time when the urge for stool came, she developed the pain.

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,010
-Every day or during a crisis?

36
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,650
-During every crisis.

37
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:34,500
-Every crisis since the beginning? She had that pain?

38
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,290
That particular pain in the same place?

39
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:44,650
-Yes but this time it was extremely pronounced and she focused on it again and again.

40
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:52,540
On the 12th of October we started the C12 and on the 17th of October the fever subsided

41
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,040
but the stool problems remained also mainly during the night.

42
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,750
It actually wasn't real stool anymore at that time, only pieces of mucus and blood

43
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:08,290
and the main problem I underlined twice at that time was these severe pains.

44
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,550
She described it in the following way.

45
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,040
The pain begins and then immediately she has to bend double and immediately

46
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,800
she has to rush to the toilet but she does not have stool every time,

47
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,760
it's mainly this intensive urge.

48
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:32,260
Then she also reported that since two days, the stomach fluids were rising

49
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,770
every time she had this urge and that she always feels she is one step from vomiting

50
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,860
but she never vomits.

51
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,760
The modality we had at that time was that it was always bad after sleeping

52
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,110
even if it was only a short nap.

53
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,510
-The pain?
-Yes.

54
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:58,110
The pain is ameliorated either by lying on the left side or by bending double.

55
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,510
Then she had salivation on her pillow, the trembling of the fingers,

56
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:10,510
she perspired a lot at that time and all complains were worse after sleep.

57
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,090
Then we tickled out two facts in her emotional sphere.

58
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,330
One is that she can not say no to anybody.

59
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,580
If somebody wants something from her, he will get it.

60
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:30,340
Even in this bad state she was in, she still pulls leg to go out of the way for other people.

61
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,430
And on the other hand she can easily react aggressively, especially within the family,

62
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,990
with her mother and her father.

63
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,890
At that time she already received injections of vitamins and iron.

64
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:51,880
All together one can say that this attack, this crisis lasted a lot longer than the ones before

65
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,390
but it was never as severe as the ones before had been.

66
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,390
During the entire time she could continue going to school while in former times

67
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,670
she was at home after four days and two weeks later she always was in the hospital.

68
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,140
-During that crisis did you use Colocynthis at all?

69
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,390
-No. In this phase they were I think it was about 10 days where we could not reach you.

70
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:20,640
And so during this time we went up with the cortisone, I think 2,30 mg with mg every day

71
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:27,520
but I have discussed this with you and on October 29th 1999 after I have sent you the fax

72
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:35,280
we both talked on the telephone. Then you asked me the deciding question if I like fat.

73
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:41,780
And if I never ever ate anything that only looked like that maybe could contain fat,

74
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:50,150
then you prescribed Pulsatilla C200 and so with Pulsatilla C200 it went better, day by day.

75
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:55,390
It took about another week for her to really get out of the crisis completely

76
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,910
but ever since she has been taking Pulsatilla and she is doing fine.

77
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,910
So the Pulsatilla was on October 29th 1999.

78
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,050
-She continues with how many mg of cortisone now?

79
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:14,570
-5 mg.

80
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,560
-For how long is on 5 mg now? Since November?

81
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,230
-She reduced gradually and the amount of 5 mg is now for about two weeks.

82
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,630
And she is doing well in spite of the fact that right now she is undergoing

83
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:41,000
the final exams at school and it is quite a stressful situation.

84
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:50,880
-She is in high school now, she is finishing high school, the last class?

85
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,730
-The last class, 13th grade yes.

86
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:05,470
-What can we say? We can not change the remedy.

87
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,380
-What is also important is that I frequently had a cold in the past times

88
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,740
and I also developed herpes again on my nose.

89
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,460
-Where?

90
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:25,470
-She had it before the colitis started, just very shortly before.

91
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:28,970
-And this time was as bad as the original one?

92
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,720
-Yes.

93
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,230
-Sure?

94
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,820
-Yes and I had it twice another time right down here.

95
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,810
-And you didn't do anything to suppress it?
-Nothing.

96
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,220
-You say that you are under stress but why you are under stress?

97
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,470
Just because you take examinations or because you haven't studied enough?

98
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,070
-Just because the exams are now.

99
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:09,500
-But she has studied, she feels she knows.
-Yes, up to now yes.

100
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:20,400
-After Pulsatilla do you feel more cold in general or still you are in the hot side?

101
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,250
-I feel colder.

102
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,500
-Very cold?
-No, it's OK.

103
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,660
-Is she bothered at all with drafts?
-I wouldn't say so, no.

104
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,510
-Stool now is normal, it is formed?
-Completely normal, formed.

105
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,100
-The nails are good, strong?

106
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,210
-In the moment they are quite OK, relatively normal, not completely strong but OK.

107
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:13,410
-We have to continue with the same remedy until we see there is a possibility

108
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:24,010
that she may go to Silica after. She may or she may not, we don't give it.

109
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,790
-How quickly would you advise to reduce the cortisone in this situation?

110
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,290
-It's two weeks now that she is taking 5 mg. Can she regulate it to 1 mg less?

111
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:45,500
-No, only 1,25. She can only divide it into quarters.

112
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:53,350
-Into two quarters which means 1,25 she could reduce it.

113
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:09,020
One more week that means 20 days she can reduce one more quarter.

114
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:20,170
One more week, that means 20 days from the last moment she reduced,

115
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,770
she can reduce again one quarter.

116
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:30,170
Does she pay any attention to her diet?
-No due to the school stress that's impossible.

117
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:36,520
-But does she eat junk food also?
-Every now and then yes.

118
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,830
-She is a bit of an anarchist.

119
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,080
-The only times when she ever paid a bit attention to her diet

120
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:55,020
were in the absolute crisis times. Otherwise she just loves eating sweets.

121
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:08,030
-I see. OK Eva you are free for the time being.

122
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:34,330
For instance talking about Eva and you remember the 12 levels. We have the 12 levels.

123
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:50,740
12, 11, 10 etc. Which level Eva is?

124
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,230
-Nine.

125
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,370
-Eva is somewhere around here.

126
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:30,790
That means whenever you see that there is a frequent change of remedy picture

127
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:37,790
and the pathology is deep, that means the person is in danger,

128
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:43,140
the person is close to malignancy

129
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:48,920
in which you will have to change your remedies frequently.

130
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:54,250
Here according to the original idea, how many remedies we said

131
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,850
we will need to bring up patience?

132
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:06,170
You remember the analysis of this? We said here only one remedy, we start two remedies

133
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:12,940
for these levels, three remedies for these levels, 4,5,6,7,12,20 remedies

134
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:25,920
for down here to bring up, if we are ever able to bring up this.

135
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:34,420
You will see for instance with Eva, when she will come up, she is already I believe

136
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,280
somewhere here between 6 and 7 level at this moment.

137
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:51,760
After a year or two, you will see Eva getting frequent acutes.

138
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:03,590
That is the time you feel OK, the danger is away now.

139
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:09,250
-The question concerns cases like the one of Eva where we are forced to use

140
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,660
very strong acting orthodox medication like cortisone, like anti-epileptic medicines

141
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,840
and so on and these medications change the chemistry of the organism in a massive way.

142
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:27,240
And in these situations I always come into conflict, due to the influence of the medication,

143
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,830
patients often develop clear remedy pictures but they have to do with the influence

144
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,820
of this medication and then I always am in conflict do I prescribe

145
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,080
on the actual momentary symptoms which are strongly influenced by the orthodox medicine

146
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:50,760
or do I take a remedy which represents the state the patient was in before all this started?

147
00:15:51,520 --> 00:16:01,510
-When we treat severe pathology under allopathic drugs, let us say a rule ideally.

148
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:16,570
If we say this case is curable, ideally we should be able to bring back health

149
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:25,000
by cutting the drugs, reducing the drugs and never again coming back to the conventional drugs.

150
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:33,150
If ideally we knew so well Homeopathy as to prescribe at the right time, the right moment,

151
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:39,430
the right medicine, the right potency and sometimes in such cases

152
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:44,730
you may have to change in one day, to change the remedy.

153
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:50,580
So therefore your question is, yes when you have severe pathology and you have a picture

154
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,150
you prescribe it, in spite of the fact that that picture has been created by allopathic drug.

155
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:08,660
Ideally if this case is curable, why do we need to resort to conventional medicine

156
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:16,230
at the moment? Because we can not have the control of the case through Homeopathy

157
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:22,250
and especially these cases are more difficult for me because I'm not present.

158
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,320
They try to find me on the telephone or send me a fax but a fax, a telephone

159
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:36,060
is not at all the same as when you have the patient in front of you

160
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,820
and you can realize the severity, you can see the picture,

161
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,670
maybe the person is exaggerating or whatever.

162
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:55,570
So therefore not that I try to find excuses for myself but I say that

163
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:05,520
if we knew what we are doing ideally, we were perfect, we should be able to carry these cases

164
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:17,810
from 9 level to level 5 or 3 or 4. Ideally, without intervention of allopathic drugs.

165
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:28,810
This is not all possible and you have to resort again and again, in epileptic cases etc.

166
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:35,550
Otherwise you may have problems, you may have a status epilepticus and then the case is finished.

167
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:42,110
She will stay for ever damaged, you can not just cut epileptic drugs especially

168
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:47,710
when you have mental disorders complicated with epilepsy.

169
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:55,210
In such cases you don't withdraw the drugs, you have to be very careful

170
00:18:55,310 --> 00:19:00,710
because when the whole force of the disease comes with the right remedy,

171
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,040
you have to know what to do next.

172
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,530
-I would like to ask another question concerning Eva's case.

173
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,770
It has to do with the dosage.

174
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:17,030
If I understood correctly, she is taking Pulsatilla C200 every day,

175
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,130
meaning she is doing that since approximately four months.

176
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:29,350
-If somebody is under allopathic drugs, especially heavy drugs,

177
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:37,040
in order to counteract the effect of the drugs, you have to repeat the remedy.

178
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,280
You have to repeat it and frequently.

179
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:46,860
If it is 200 or 30 you have to repeat it once the day, if you prescribe under this,

180
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:54,600
that means 8,12,6 you have to repeat it 3, 4 times the day to counteract

181
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:03,700
the effect of the drug, until you are able to withdraw the drug totally.

182
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:22,140
For me I would be very happy if you understand how to evaluate a situation.

183
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,020
You know the Theory so well in your mind that you understand every time,

184
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,610
now it is wrong, now it is correct.

185
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:37,510
You know when you have prescribed wrong, you know when you have prescribed correct.

186
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:46,530
That is a great thing, a great knowledge that a homeopath could have.

187
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,930
-I understand your first prognosis that you said it's going to take about 5 years for her

188
00:20:54,030 --> 00:21:00,030
to be cured because her colitis is complicated, for example with the compulsive neurosis.

189
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:05,450
And they were some factors making the whole thing more difficult for one that

190
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:10,690
the entire treatment was mainly done through fax and telephone and so for me

191
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:15,190
I have the impression that some remedies she received in the mean time

192
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:21,180
before she got Pulsatilla, some of them helped her but some of them didn't help that much.

193
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,180
The main reason why you decided for Pulsatilla was her strong aversion against fat.

194
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,680
-Not the only reason.

195
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:40,680
-Yes, since she has always had that strong aversion to fat, couldn't it be possible

196
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:46,410
that if she had received Pulsatilla from the very beginning, that this whole healing process

197
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,920
could have been speed up much more?

198
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,510
Also mentally she is having quite an amelioration which we can see due to the fact

199
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,510
that she has a boyfriend now, even though she has had a severe disappointment in the past.

200
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:06,170
How much it would have been right or appropriate to have hope that her case

201
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,170
could be cured quicker than the initial prognosis said?

202
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:17,690
-That's a good question. I'm very happy that you are making such a correct observation.

203
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,760
In this case perhaps you missed the fact or she did not mention it that Pulsatilla

204
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,610
was given before to her without much effect.

205
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:40,510
In the process of giving several remedies, by the time she was calling me etc.

206
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,370
I had prescribed Pulsatilla again.

207
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:49,340
That is the first where we know that now Pulsatilla is indicated.

208
00:22:49,440 --> 00:23:00,590
That leads us to understand that there is a time for each remedy that has to be given

209
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:13,350
and as we peel off layer after layer, remedy after remedy, then we come more and more close

210
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:22,560
to the healing remedy, I would say, that will have the best effect.

211
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:29,420
But without the previous peeling off, this will not be possible.

212
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:39,250
And this is always, it's not only this case.

213
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:47,490
It's many cases in which we have prescribed the remedy, no effect.

214
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:52,490
You prescribe another one and another one and you come back to the original

215
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:58,440
and then the original acts. Which shows that there is a time...

216
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:07,580
If you remember or you will see it later on that I have explained the different layers.

217
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:18,160
You will remember this, saying that the second layer brings 1,2,3 possible symptoms

218
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:25,500
from the underlined layer and there is another layer which has a symptom going right through.

219
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:34,260
And in spite of being clear symptom, it will not show an effect until you reach...

220
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:41,510
You take out these 2 layers and then that symptom becomes indicative of this layer.

221
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,520
You most probably if you have not seen that lecture, you will see it.

222
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,660
-My other question, whether this last follow up we saw now, doesn't it give us hope

223
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,150
that the prognosis can be better now than it was initially?

224
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:14,040
-Yes. But this moment the prognosis is, let us say, 30% better than the initial prognosis.

225
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:23,840
That means we arrived at a point where some real hope has arrived.
