1
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:28,880
Before we go further I would like to analyze more systematically

2
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:36,140
what took place in this case and to show you how I thought.

3
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:44,060
When the practitioner took the follow up, if you observed, she came

4
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,570
and said certain things have happened but I'm confused. Did you hear her saying that?

5
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,300
Many times we are in a similar situation.

6
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:06,970
So in order to avoid that, to say I'm confused, I don't know what to do,

7
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:15,100
we have to know certain principles, certain laws that exist and to apply them every time.

8
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,700
There were several questions concerning the follow up of this case.

9
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,600
The first question is whether your remedy has acted, yes or no?

10
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:41,350
The second question is if it has acted, did it move the case correctly or wrongly?

11
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,350
That means it was a close remedy or it was the exact remedy,

12
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,780
the remedy that really the person needed?

13
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,960
You have to answer these questions clearly in your mind.

14
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,960
There is a difference here, I don't do it on purpose.

15
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:11,210
The practitioner said I'm confused, I said you are doing very well. I was pleased.

16
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,210
What is the difference that made me being pleased

17
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,290
and the practitioner saying I'm confused? The difference is on facts.

18
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:27,790
I evaluate the facts in a different way perhaps than the practitioner.

19
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,970
What I hear is first of all she took the remedy and then she fall asleep

20
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,310
and she felt she slept deeply.

21
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:44,890
This for me is almost an infallible symptom showing that the remedy has acted curatively.

22
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:55,620
Then this person sleeps for 10-15 days, gathers a little bit more energy for one week,

23
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,130
then on the following...

24
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,370
There are two months between the remedy and the follow up.

25
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:09,120
The follow up is taken middle of July and the remedy was given middle of May.

26
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,370
This is a two month follow up that we are observing.

27
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:21,290
The person says I slept and it was very good.

28
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:29,290
Then I had perhaps a little more energy because in the evening I was socializing,

29
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,790
before I could not do it, now I'm doing it.

30
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,390
Very good.

31
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:44,390
Then I hear the practitioner and herself saying she is lately on the depressive side.

32
00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:02,290
I also hear the patient saying certain things happened with her eyes, squinting the eyes

33
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,880
and then she developed these impulses...

34
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:12,210
And I have to put all these into a logical sequence and understanding of what has happened.

35
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,890
Otherwise I'm going to make a mistake.

36
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:25,290
What did I say to myself is that the remedy acted because of the reaction.

37
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:35,380
Also it took away some of the desires, pickles and also aversion to sweet

38
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:43,790
that eventually had and brought about a change in the general temperature of the person.

39
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:50,970
Where she was rather cold person, she became so warm that she could not cool down.

40
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,880
These drastic changes together with the fact that she slept so deeply,

41
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,130
together with the fact that for some time the energy was better,

42
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,980
it shows that the remedy acted.

43
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:14,370
But now she comes and says I have impulsive tendency to commit suicide,

44
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:22,730
I'm on the depressive side, my energy is not better, it might be even worse.

45
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,530
You hear me saying, you are doing well. Why she is doing well?

46
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,110
Because she felt better for one week? No. Because of what I know.

47
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:41,040
Now what she presents to me is a case of Argentum nitricum.

48
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:53,690
What has happened is that Graphites acted and took away the first layer

49
00:05:53,790 --> 00:06:00,690
and another layer is coming up, quite clearly which is represented

50
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:06,050
by a clear picture of Argentum nitricum.

51
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:18,350
That is why now I can be sure that in this case, which is deep pathology, we have hope.

52
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:27,610
The reaction was very good from the first remedy presented, did whatever it could.

53
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:34,110
If you let this patient go on without Argentum nitricum, she would go on suffering

54
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:40,590
and suffering. You will not see the real effect of a cure. Why?

55
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:45,440
Because she needed the second remedy to complete the action of the first.

56
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:52,350
If you make a mistake and you give another remedy, instead of Argentum nitricum,

57
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:58,090
you may have eventually a confused case and finally you will not see

58
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:03,680
what we want to see with Homeopathy after a period of time that the health of the person

59
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,780
really gets better and better and better.

60
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:13,850
The idea with Homeopathy is that we don't have the elimination of the symptoms immediately.

61
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,090
The idea is that according to the pathology of the person we prescribe correctly.

62
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:24,770
So year after year the person's health is improving, we are regenerating the health.

63
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:31,260
Don't forget we don't eliminate the symptoms. Not that we don't bother by symptoms,

64
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,060
not that we say never mind you suffer.

65
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:41,820
We are guided by the symptoms but how? In a very scientific, precise way.

66
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,630
We like Homeopathy to be very precise.

67
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,350
Don't miss anything. You have to take into consideration all the information

68
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:57,690
that is coming and evaluate it properly, correctly and with care.

69
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,930
It's not that you don't care about whether she is suffering.

70
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,940
It's not that I don't care when I say you're doing very well, when she says I'm exhausted,

71
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,190
I'm tired. It's not that I don't care but what I see in my mind it's coming out beautifully,

72
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,430
its' so clear, great, it's going to act.

73
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:23,680
Now she is going to find out how she is going to be better and better.

74
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,760
That's why I'm saying in the interview, now you are going to see the follow ups

75
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:35,270
and see whether I was right saying in the interview you are doing great.

76
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,520
Where the great is? The great is not there, where she wants to commit suicide,

77
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,770
she has tiredness. This is not great.

78
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:48,010
But in my I can't retain my joy because I have seen what takes place.

79
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,760
And what I have seen is very clear.

80
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:58,760
Graphites acted and then what it means a picture of another remedy.

81
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,760
It means symptomatology. What kind of symptomatology?

82
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,930
It might be as well symptomatology on mental-emotional level.

83
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,930
How is this symptomatology is better than the other one? We don't exactly know.

84
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:26,180
Because we don't know really the main symptom which is lack of enjoyment in life.

85
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:33,850
To be alive means to enjoy, that measure is difficult for us to pin out a person.

86
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:40,680
A person does not enjoy life, it may be just indifferent and you give a remedy

87
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,680
and he becomes very aggressive and still you say he is better now

88
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,020
because before he didn't enjoy at all, he didn't care.

89
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,950
His house was put on fire and said I don't care really.

90
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:03,600
And now you just say a few words and he fights with anger and you say he is better.

91
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,440
Wait and you will see the result.

92
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:27,190
In this case Argentum nitricum was prescribed on middle of July...

93
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,060
-...1939.

94
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:52,780
-OK. Let us see now October 86, that means three months later after Argentum nitricum how she is.

95
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:15,370
-She took Argentum nitricum on the 14th of July, she took it in 200

96
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,200
and has had no prescription since then.

97
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,950
-How she is?
-Very good, excellent, stunning.

98
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,700
-She had Graphites initially?
-Yes.

99
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:48,850
-We have seen this case for the first time after Argentum nitricum?

100
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,510
-Yes this is the first time that she had her prescriptions for two months.

101
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,350
-I have not seen her.

102
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,100
-I spoke to her on the telephone, I've seen her occasionally in between,

103
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:05,360
she brings me patients and she looks better for the last couple of months

104
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,200
but I haven't prescribed.

105
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,440
But I do that her symptoms are changing and the emphasis is on different things now.

106
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,850
She looks very concerned about her cold fingers. Two things she is concerned now.

107
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:49,430
Tremendous sweating and cold fingers that she wakes up and also her hearing aid is back.

108
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:57,040
-Make her take out her hearing aid this time
-Yes this time.

109
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:19,200
-Just take it out. Can you hear?
-No, I have to do it by lip reading.

110
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:27,850
-Just turn to the other side. Can you hear what I'm saying now?

111
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,530
-No.

112
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,940
-Last time that we were talking she had a hearing aid?

113
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,950
-Yes.

114
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:56,100
This is a very crude test of course. It's not the test that the otolaryngologist will do

115
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,610
but this is the most convenient test and I'm going to do this test again

116
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:09,200
and perhaps you will see the difference and you will see what Homeopathy can do.

117
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,270
-How are you now?

118
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:30,770
-I'm much better in energy and I have not that inner tiredness that I've had for so long.

119
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,200
I just get it very occasionally.

120
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:55,110
There was a point that I didn't know what it was like and I realized what it was like

121
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,530
and almost after that it started to get back again.

122
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:15,190
Tremendous sweat. If I get very hot, then suddenly I get tremendous sweat.

123
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:31,370
In the morning I wake up in a sweat. It's really very unpleasant.

124
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:47,870
You see what you have to be aware here in this case that she says she is sweating a lot.

125
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,150
She had tuberculosis originally, I don't know if it was mentioned in the original case

126
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:05,930
but getting sweat, you have a possibility of going back into that state perhaps.

127
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:16,210
What do you feel about the sweat? What it is?

128
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:35,850
Because of her age, she is on a menopausal age, she has the possibility

129
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,860
of getting tuberculosis and be on a tubercular state

130
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:49,350
you have to examine and make sure that this is not a state where tuberculosis starts coming.

131
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:55,860
Because of her age and most probably her answer indicates

132
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,850
that this is a menopausal kind of sweating.

133
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:08,020
It is what they call the woman flushes of heat, it's not a tubercular state.

134
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:15,270
Always you have to be aware of different possibilities that exist with Homeopathy

135
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,120
and be aware of the pathology underlined and don't escape it.

136
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,100
The fact that you are treating the patient, it doesn't mean

137
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:33,780
that you are automatically protecting the person from different things that they may come.

138
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,930
-Do you have a particular time when you feel that the sweating comes,

139
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,640
like early in the morning or...?

140
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,780
-It comes early in the morning and I wake up in this sweat.

141
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,870
A tremendous thirst all the time.

142
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:04,220
-For cold or it doesn't matter?
-At night more but in the day time it turns...

143
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:16,600
I could drink cold water all the time, it doesn't matter really. It's a tremendous thirst.

144
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:27,180
-You are having your menses normally?
-They stopped.

145
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,760
-Because these are climacteric symptoms now.

146
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:41,250
-Probably. This time I had it once in a three months.

147
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:07,570
-What other symptoms are bothering you now?
-I have a lot of very thick sputum and...

148
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:13,070
-From the left ear? Did you have an X-ray?
-...

149
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:21,410
-When?
-All over the years and I had particularly...

150
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,230
-But you are bringing out sputum now?

151
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:36,830
-Yes, very thick, frothy, creamy, occasionally it's cream.

152
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:04,480
I have dripping. I have constant nasal discharge.

153
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:15,830
-Like water with no other reason?
-No.

154
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:24,240
-Do you have this perhaps when you go to the toilet for stool?

155
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,830
-As well yes.

156
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:35,900
Which is this remedy which has dripping of the nose on having stool?

157
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,830
-Thuja.

158
00:20:53,830 --> 00:21:00,090
-Do you see the next remedy coming?

159
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:24,650
What she says is that the deep tiredness is gone, she doesn't feel deep tiredness

160
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,730
and you remember from this case of Graphites, we learned a few things.

161
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:37,150
One is this deep tiredness, as she described it, that type of tiredness,

162
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:44,250
connected with the lung problems.

163
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,240
Desire for pickles, which is not mentioned in the Repertory.

164
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:59,090
The excessive thirst for cold water, which can be as excessive or as cold as Phosphorus.

165
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,920
It was not very much in your mind concerning Graphites.

166
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:25,660
Now she says still she has the tiredness, she has the sweats

167
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:33,010
which alternate with coldness,

168
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,750
she has the coldness in the hands.

169
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,750
Can you see a remedy?

170
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,580
What was her comment concerning how she felt in general?

171
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,310
-She felt better.

172
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,070
-She says she didn't know how this better was for years,

173
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:36,920
she has not experienced this feeling of being better.

174
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,500
Let's see a little bit more if you can tell me what is the next remedy.

175
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:54,480
-Now my hands get numbed, the circulation I think it stops.

176
00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:02,480
This morning three fingers were dead and all the hand went white.

177
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:19,920
It's much worse, I need to push my circulation, I often have to get up to get it going.

178
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,210
Then it's hard to hear.

179
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,900
-They went away for a period?
-Yes, everything was...

180
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I think for four weeks after the remedy, this was marvelous.

181
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,180
Now it has come back.

182
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:07,730
Did you hear what she says? The first four weeks she felt marvelous and the swelling

183
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:13,330
of the glands went away. Now the swelling of the glands is coming back.

184
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:20,580
Tiredness also but not this deep tiredness.

185
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:30,280
Now you are going to make a mistake here, I'm sure. So far it was very easy this case.

186
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:47,990
-I had a tremendous heat, they still get numbed, now my chest was still producing sputum

187
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,250
that's going on but now the noises in the head is much better.

188
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,520
-The noises in the head is better.

189
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,340
-They came back as they were before?

190
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:22,190
-Not as bad but it is a hot feeling here and I have a tremendous discharge from my ears.

191
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,090
-You have a lot of discharge after the remedy?
-Yes.

192
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:33,940
-What kind of discharge?
-It was pale, creamy yellow.

193
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:43,090
Again another point. You give Graphites which affects the ears.

194
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:51,340
Graphites increases a little bit the discharge initially, then it takes it away.

195
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,910
Then you come to Argentum nitricum. That's another level altogether

196
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:03,670
but still pushes further that point as well, discharges from the ear even more

197
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:06,170
and discharges from the lungs.

198
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:12,020
She says purulent discharge quite a lot, she felt it from the lung coming out quite a lot.

199
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,420
This is very good reaction together with the feeling of the well-being that she was having,

200
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,020
together with the tiredness going away.

201
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,170
-Do you feel any improvement in the hearing?

202
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:41,000
-It is not this last month but... the noise from the head has gone this time.

203
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:52,110
-And the hearing remained deteriorated?
-No it remained, it came up and remained.

204
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,010
-Anything else?

205
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:26,380
-A few weeks ago I had tremendous dryness, not on my eyes, skin reaction.

206
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,370
-For how long?
-It lasted for five days.

207
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:59,710
Inner burning underneath the skin, when I touched it. it was hard and thick... from getting cold...

208
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,230
always it has been a pattern.

209
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:13,190
-Last week was as severe as you expected or it was less?

210
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:24,300
-It was slightly different... I didn't feel congested after it.

211
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:33,300
-Any reaction?
-I get coughing,  spasms of coughing.

212
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:49,550
Varicose veins comes up in my right leg now, it's a mild thing.

213
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:58,050
At night I get this increasing urination and I have to get out of bed.

214
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:05,800
-After you go to bed, then you have to get up?
-Yes I just have to go to pee.

215
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:15,380
-How many times you may have to wake up?
-Sometimes six times or more.

216
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,450
-Because the water that you are drinking is too much.

217
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:31,050
-Yes I still drink a fair amount and most probably is that that makes me wake at night.

218
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,220
-You could drink gallops of water.
-I could drink.

219
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:05,110
-Also you said in the beginning that your feet could go cold and numbed.

220
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,460
-Yes now they became numbed and very cold.

221
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,690
-It used to go numbed?

222
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:26,880
-Not my feet, my hands. But they get this cold all the time.

223
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,870
That's it, the interview. What are you going to do?

224
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,880
This is your biggest chance for mistake.

225
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:57,460
-Tuberculinum.

226
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,460
-Nothing

227
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:14,790
-Sac lac [placebo]
-Why sac lac?

228
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:26,760
-But she seems to be going into a kind of relapse. What about that?

229
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,030
-It's not clear enough.
-Very good.

230
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,360
-What if you repeat Argentum nitricum?

231
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:56,170
-You have a very good possibility to spoil the case.

232
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:04,920
The symptomatology on which we prescribed Argentum nitricum

233
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,020
were the impulses, were the heat, the desire for sweets.

234
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:20,660
If this symptomatology was back, we were justified to prescribe or to repeat Argentum nitricum.

235
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,930
But this symptomatology is not there at all.

236
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:27,170
She is feeling very well. Actually she says for the first time I felt so well in my life,

237
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,530
I don't remember how it was to be well.

238
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:39,840
Now the glands are getting swollen, there is an excessive perspiration

239
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:45,680
and those two symptoms together with the tuberculosis of the past

240
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:50,270
indicate a possibility of Tuberculinum.

241
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:57,270
But do we have enough symptomatology to prescribe Tuberculinum at this stage?

242
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,110
Not according to this interview.

243
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,350
Therefore what we have to do now is to wait.

244
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,350
This is three months after the second remedy. Still we have to wait.

245
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:18,340
To see if another picture really develops and then we can prescribe.

246
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,770
Because during that time, now we can spoil this case.

247
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:30,000
I promise you, if you start prescribing in this case, a few months later, six months later,

248
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,600
you will not recognize the case.

249
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:39,100
But leave it alone and see what happens.

250
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:51,020
You prescribed Graphites in the beginning, could it be anything else? No, it was correct.

251
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,250
Especially because it was confirmed by this last keynote

252
00:34:56,350 --> 00:35:00,510
and then it did whatever it could and produced a clear picture of Argentum nitricum.

253
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:04,010
Beautiful. You gave it, you had a good reaction.

254
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:08,770
Now here you don't have enough information to change your remedy, repeat your remedy,

255
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,350
prescribe a higher potency, no.

256
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:16,100
So hands up, don't worry, she is going to be well.

257
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:35,080
Let's see the next. This case again last February and then a few days ago,

258
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:40,720
so I show you the two follow ups, so you have a complete picture of a year treatment.

259
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:53,120
See also the pathology how deep it is. It is not a simple case, it is complicated.

260
00:35:53,220 --> 00:36:02,170
The hearing since childhood is impaired, the lungs from many, many years.

261
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:08,170
She has been eating up a lot of antibiotics, injections, treatments.

262
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:15,620
The circulation, the vascular system is in a very precarious condition.

263
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,410
So it is very deep pathology.

264
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:23,420
You see bronchiectasis, impaired hearing, Raynaud's syndrome,

265
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,270
all this is a complex, which does not make the case easy.

266
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:46,110
-This is case MAH, date of birth 20 of 9th 1939.

267
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:53,760
I saw her again on December the 4th 1986 and her glands have been up again,

268
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:07,590
her hearing had been better for some time but it was relapsing again, she was tired again

269
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,850
and she'd been having some nights sweats.

270
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:18,510
She felt some times that she was in a daze and she still had some impulses

271
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:24,870
to jump under trains but finally they were coming less and less.

272
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:35,190
She'd lost a lot of weight and she had been passing a lot of urine but that had improved.

273
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:44,170
She said her appetite was enormous and she was hungry for anything

274
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,850
but not particularly sweets anymore.

275
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:54,010
Her eyes were getting worse, she was having tears in her glasses more often,

276
00:37:54,110 --> 00:38:00,760
her numbness in her fingers was getting worse again, that fluctuates all the time.

277
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,510
She was always complaining about her cold hands.

278
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:08,010
She felt that the deep fatigue of the past was not there

279
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:13,860
but she still feels a tremendous weariness and she consistently complains about this.

280
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:22,250
Basically her thirst was more normal and she has no particular craving for anything,

281
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,770
she is just very hungry.

282
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:27,840
She was very insistent that she had something, so I gave her some sac lac.

283
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:34,090
She felt better afterwards and again she came back in February the 5th

284
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:37,840
about one week ago and she is complaining of a different sort of tiredness.

285
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:41,090
She says she doesn't have the deep fatigue, I questioned her very deeply on this.

286
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:44,420
She said she needs tremendous amount of sleep, she will complain to you

287
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,510
about the fact that she is feeling tired all the time, she can't concentrate on her work.

288
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,260
I feel there is some new things coming through from her.

289
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,510
She has this very deep inner frustration, which she talked about

290
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:05,750
and it's always a desire that she has to get on and she is using these words,

291
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,960
every time she comes to see me, "I really want to get on,

292
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:10,710
I'm fed up being ill, I feel that I must..."

293
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,510
She's got some fight in her now where before she had no fight.

294
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:19,590
And she is lonely, it's coming through very strong that she doesn't want to be on her own.

295
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,840
We talked about sometimes to have a relationship, so her energy is so much better

296
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:28,670
that she is actually thinking about having a relationship.

297
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,160
I agree that she has been ill for so long, she is beginning

298
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,610
to have some feelings about the situation.

299
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,270
-Did she have the possibility of meeting somebody?

300
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:42,770
-She has some boyfriend who is been lingering around, but he is obviously very vague,

301
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:47,010
he was not consistent and she wants more commitment than he is willing to give.

302
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:51,260
She stressed very strongly to me that damp aggravates her, she says that

303
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,210
whenever she is in damp condition she loses all her energy.

304
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:58,710
So if she goes to the west coast of England she feels like she used to feel

305
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:03,810
when she had tuberculosis. It's very strongly stressed.

306
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:07,750
Her chest is being getting worse again, there is more expectoration,

307
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:14,110
this bronchiectasis Cause, although the expectoration is no longer green.

308
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,010
-She had a lot of expectoration the last time I saw her?

309
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:27,980
-Yes. The hot flushes are better, there are no night sweats since the beginning of January,

310
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,660
her glands and throat had gone up and down and she hasn't had period since August.

311
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,900
Her hearing cleared up tremendously from after the treatment but it's relapsed again now.

312
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,390
-You mean she was able to hear without hearing aid?

313
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:49,150
-No, you ask her because she is never clear to me. She says it was better

314
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,140
and now it's gone back and I say with or without the hearing aid

315
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,230
but she says I need the hearing aid...

316
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,410
So I'm not entirely clear about that.

317
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:02,400
She gets me into more involved... she keeps talking about this tiredness

318
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,390
and she wants to get on and I feel she is a lot better

319
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:12,480
and I begin to see that there are some new things creeping in and that's all I want to say.

320
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,470
But she stressed to me the suffering by the sea and the dampness

321
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:20,730
and how much she relapses, so she can't even think to go away on holidays

322
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:25,070
because if she goes away to the west coast, she is ill.

323
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,060
-But it's very cold in there?

324
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:37,730
-It's not, it's the dampness and the cold. She says I suffer by the sea.

325
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:42,230
-And she had only one dose of Argentum nitricum 200 in July 1986?

326
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:50,830
-Yes one dose, you said nothing else. She thinks she has but it's only...

327
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:02,000
-What is your impression, she will need a remedy?
-Yes.

328
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:09,280
-Most probably yes. What will be the remedy?
-Tuberculinum.

329
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:23,530
-Why? Because she is worse by the sea side? Lose weight, history of tuberculosis?

330
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,780
All right, let's see.

331
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,530
-You have some notes?
-I've made some notes yes.

332
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:06,510
-Very good. What I want before the notes, I want you to give me a general idea of...

333
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:13,350
Last time we met it was October. During that period of time generally

334
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:23,200
how you were considering the initial kind of problems that you came with?

335
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:29,520
It was this deep tiredness mostly and all this psychological state.

336
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,620
So how you are in general from that point of view?

337
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:39,620
-The tiredness is changed, it's not that...

338
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:49,450
It's more now I'm tired and I want to sleep but I haven't got that inner tiredness.

339
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:07,790
And from the psychological side I didn't get faint easily, I got more fight.

340
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:27,190
My hearing suddenly became very clear. For five days, I was walking around,

341
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:31,520
hearing sounds I haven't heard for years and then it's gone.

342
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:37,030
-When it was that from the improvement?
-After about...

343
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:40,510
-Last month or December or November?

344
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:46,510
-The same month with the remedy, it suddenly cleared, it was really clear,

345
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:50,100
it was like a fog going away.

346
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,440
-But you were still wearing your hearing aid?

347
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:59,190
-Yes I did but I could cut it, I certainly heard sounds that I haven't heard before

348
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:01,370
even with the hearing aid on.

349
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,020
-But she has the hearing aid now.

350
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:09,260
-I have it now. But now I just got this impatience. I want to get on.

351
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,270
-You are very impatient.

352
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:22,520
-Because I have enough of being... and I do want to keep on accepting things

353
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:28,370
but I feel that I got the energy and just it has been cut.

354
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:44,770
I can feel progress. I can see a lot of progress, I feel calmer though I got the fight

355
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:54,780
and in healthier state generally. It was chaos...

356
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,630
Now it's coming and going.

357
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:06,350
It's very interesting how she describes the effect of the treatment, where it was chaos,

358
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:12,850
entropy, it is coming to an organization where our remedy is doing,

359
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:19,270
it's organizing the different levels but remember we have to give it time.

360
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:24,380
Give it time, don't rush into conclusions.

361
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:29,690
You see when I rushed into giving a remedy after two months,

362
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:34,430
I had my strong reasons for doing that.

363
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:36,370
Don't rush.

364
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:44,520
Did the practitioner gave you the impression that this woman should get a remedy?

365
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:49,380
What is your impression from hearing this case? Should you give a remedy?

366
00:46:55,370 --> 00:47:03,130
You see the subjectiveness of evaluation...

367
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,860
Two people look at the same case and one says, no wait and the other one says,

368
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:19,290
why not, try this. This is our biggest weakness in Homeopathy.

369
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:23,940
Try this, why not? It looks like so much.

370
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:30,770
Try this and then the mistake and then the big sighs, Ignatia state.

371
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,620
Oh god I made it again.

372
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,520
In these cases you don't have many...

373
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:50,770
The organism is not in a powerful state to resist your remedies.

374
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:54,780
Your remedies are going to affect this, if they are the wrong ones.

375
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,710
You have to be very careful whether you will prescribe or not.

376
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:06,210
I don't say don't prescribe now but try to tell me if you will prescribe.

377
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:09,680
-Perspiration?

378
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:17,690
-The night sweats have stopped. Last night it was very hot generally and I seemed sweaty.

379
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:24,470
I haven't got the control yet.

380
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:28,780
If I get cold, I get cold easily, if I get hot, I get hot easily

381
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:37,040
but still I haven't got what we call more balance. But my night sweat is gone.

382
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:46,270
-But if the weather is damp, then it's...?

383
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:55,030
-Damp and really hot damp it's OK. If it's cold damp or in between like the English spring

384
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:59,770
and autumn or when it keeps changing, I have no energy then.

385
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:08,880
If I go away to the country, I just end up tired and I don't sleep a lot.

386
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:17,780
But if it's hot and humid, then that's fine. I have a lot of energy.

387
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:25,770
-In United States? In Hawaii, in Florida?

388
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:32,850
-Yes, just north of that, near Charleston where it's hot I had bags of energy then.

389
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:38,790
-No problem. God, it's terrible climate!

390
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:46,190
Another point. The practitioner said she is wasting away and she gives an impression

391
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:48,180
that she is losing weight.

392
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:52,690
Do you see this?
-No.

393
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:54,680
-Normal.

394
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:58,190
-It's not only normal, she looks much better than originally.

395
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:02,620
You will see her face and everything looks fine.

396
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:11,280
It's not a person who is in a tuberculosis state who is wasting away, nothing of that type.

397
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:15,210
Her color is very good, her appearance is good.

398
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,870
-The sunshine.

399
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:27,620
-Maybe you feel more the cold now, you are more sensitive to cold.

400
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,610
-Yes I'm very sensitive to cold but this last winter I haven't got cold badly.

401
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:36,860
I only liked, I didn't enjoy it.

402
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,020
-But it's not as bad as it was.

403
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:44,380
-It may have been half as bad, I think I have to put more clothes but it hasn't mentally got me.

404
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:50,280
-The expectoration from the chest?

405
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:59,530
-That's variable. Sometimes it's not at all, I have more pain the last two months.

406
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:03,630
-Do you smoke?
-No. I never have done.

407
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:05,940
-The sputum?

408
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:15,400
-Now it's creamy white. In the mornings it's obviously thicker.

409
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,880
Sometimes in the mornings it doesn't come out. At the end of the day,

410
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,790
in the evening then it's very thick.

411
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:25,990
-I see.

412
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:42,150
-You had also noises in the ears?
-That has gone completely.

413
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:46,460
The last 2-3 weeks it's slightly there when I'm tired in the evenings perhaps

414
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,100
but nothing like it was.

415
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:06,460
-Also you had some nodules in the throat that they were swollen and they were down

416
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,400
and then they came up again?

417
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:15,050
-It's slightly hard here. This side is better but then it comes up.

418
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:17,050
-Hard and painful?

419
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:22,790
-Yes I can feel pain compared to that side. But that to me is all part of

420
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:27,900
when the ears eventually will get better, I'm sure this goes together.

421
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:37,150
I do get sore throat occasionally, not as I was getting sore throat, quite a lot.

422
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:46,500
What I have is a sensation of a hair in my throat for about six weeks but that it's now gone.

423
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:07,390
-You had these chest infections with discharge from the ears.

424
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:09,480
Now you don't get anything of that?

425
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,630
-From my left ear I get occasionally brownish discharge.

426
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:21,470
The right ear it did get more but some of it is maybe condensation from my hearing aid.

427
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:27,710
It's more clear, slight yellow.

428
00:53:51,450 --> 00:54:00,460
-How do you feel now considering your social life?

429
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:06,600
-I feel a battle all the time because I have to paste things. I'm thinking of being too tired,

430
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:13,780
not able to keep up.

431
00:54:20,530 --> 00:54:25,680
-What about your sexual energy? Has it changed, has it come up more?

432
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,100
-Nothing has changed, it's very constant.

433
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:43,220
-You remember you had a fear of disease, do you remember that?

434
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:56,570
-Yes, I don't have a fear of disease. I have cricking hips every time I get up my hips crick.

435
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:03,470
I hate that or my knees are not coming up straight.

436
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:07,220
-I want to say that her mother had two operations for arthritis,

437
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,820
so you have been worried about it.

438
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:21,320
-Your mother at what age?
-At her 60's but she was familiar with it.

439
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:43,970
What is your next proposition?
-Placebo.

440
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:46,070
-You are more careful now.

441
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:57,470
You can't give another remedy. You must not give another remedy.

442
00:55:57,570 --> 00:55:59,550
You do not have the right to give another remedy. Why?

443
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:04,900
Because there are not enough symptoms to guide you to a prescription.

444
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:14,910
It is much better to wait. Now she may not get fast enough better, as you might have liked.

445
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:23,890
She is getting so much better that you don't realize it perhaps

446
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:27,080
that she is getting so much better considering what she had.

447
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:34,470
The fact also that the color of the sputum and the quality of the sputum changes,

448
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:41,820
it will show the different stages she has been through.

449
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:54,050
That means the defenses are working and bringing as fast as she can do it,

450
00:56:54,150 --> 00:57:00,060
her defense mechanism can do it by bringing order. That's what she has said.

451
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:07,650
There is some order coming in me. Then you just watch it.

452
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:16,390
This is not going to any kind of danger, she is not having any really severe problem,

453
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:20,240
she says I would like to have more energy.

454
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:26,740
If I ask the whole class here, tell me one that says I have enough energy, I don't want anymore.

455
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:33,390
There is no such thing, especially under the pollution situation in which we live,

456
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:39,490
under the stresses, under all this who does not complain for lack of energy? Tell me one.

457
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:49,890
You have to wait until the pathology takes its time, sort it out

458
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:52,740
and then the energy will start be coming.

459
00:57:55,240 --> 00:58:01,660
And then you may have this case after 2, 3, 5 years better, better, better...

460
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,320
These are the cases that will bring the other cases also.

461
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:14,720
They will say I'm benefited after a year, still I'm not well but what a difference.

462
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:18,330
Let's see the last interview a few days ago.

463
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:46,970
-She was diagnosed with bronchiectasis, I'd like to have seen these old X-rays

464
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,410
compared with the now.

465
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:58,000
-The main thing she is complaining about now, she has some new symptoms.

466
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:03,070
Her joints are very swollen and may definitely be, sometimes she comes

467
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:05,340
and I see her arms are very swollen.

468
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,080
Ankles feel swollen sometimes and they feel quite painful

469
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:12,330
and she continues the complaints about her hips cricking

470
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:17,830
and because her mother is now arthritic and she had two operations, she is very anxious now

471
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:21,590
that she doesn't become arthritic like her mother but it's definitely something

472
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:24,760
which started to develop, she can't put her rings on.

473
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:29,020
And you said that something will start to develop and it has.

474
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:35,020
She has no hot flushes for the last 3 or 4 weeks.

475
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:41,370
The only thing that she changes in her food is the desire for cheese,

476
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:44,080
she said she was craving cheese the last time I saw her.

477
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,340
-Not anymore?

478
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:53,420
-She is craving cheese but sweet desire has gone and she desires sour, three underlines.

479
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:59,250
Cheese and sour. Sometimes her glands come up and go down still.

480
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:06,740
Everything is basically better but there are some new symptoms.

481
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:17,120
-I would like you to give me an overall impression of your health,

482
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:21,610
what is your overall impression? How are you doing?

483
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:28,460
-I really feel much better, I began to see some energy there.

484
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:38,610
Do you see now? We prescribed in October and it's May and it's the first time she says

485
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:44,300
I feel a lot better, it's the first time she said it clearly. Because you waited enough,

486
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,050
because you haven't prescribed.

487
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:53,170
If you had prescribed, you would not hear that. I'm absolutely sure.

488
01:00:57,410 --> 01:01:05,140
Unless we do understand this aspect of Homeopathy, unless we do perceive the deepness

489
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:14,890
and what we do, how deep we affect the organism and until we appreciate this deep action upon,

490
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:19,140
it's like a surgery, it goes very deep and corrects.

491
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:24,140
Then you wait, take your hands off and you wait to see what is happening.

492
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:35,400
Things fall into place. I will test her hearing now to see how her hearing is.

493
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:45,410
-I collapse but I can easily get up and then easily get down.

494
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:54,730
On the other hand I got more spark and it can last. I can laugh more easily.

495
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:56,410
-It's good.

496
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:02,150
-I got other things coming up like some swellings.

497
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:06,900
-Where the swellings are now?
-In my joints.

498
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,230
-All the joints have started swelling?
-My hands particularly in the mornings.

499
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:24,060
Some mornings I can hardly move my fingers and my feet particularly in the mornings

500
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:30,910
I can't put certain shoes on and then they get better and I can't put rings on them in the morning.

501
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:36,820
-Later on you can?
-Yes. It's not as it used to be.

502
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:46,570
-But the joints seem to be swollen and stay swollen or they go up and down?

503
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:55,390
-They stay all day but it's worse when I wake up. This thing particularly has been moving.

504
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:04,390
When I wake in the morning with pain, that goes all day. I have tremendous cricking hips,

505
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:13,400
every time I get to move my hips crick. It doesn't hurt but I hate the feeling.

506
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:18,910
-It's cricking, it's not bones that come together.

507
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:28,480
The cricking is air, which goes inside the sacks, which are around the joint

508
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:39,980
and this is what makes the noise. It's just air like little sacks, if you squeeze them.

509
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:50,390
Don't imagine it's the joints which are hitting each other.

510
01:03:50,490 --> 01:03:51,650
-Is this from the antibiotics?

511
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:56,230
Because when I used to get antibiotics I got rashes always with every antibiotic

512
01:03:56,330 --> 01:04:01,730
and I didn't really bother about them but the actual consultant said that they are worried

513
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:05,950
that it might affect my joints.

514
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:11,950
-There is some kind of infection, we can actually do some laboratory tests

515
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:20,460
for rheumatoid arthritis and see the rate. Just these two factors.

516
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:24,860
Also what I would like to know is... You have been treated for bronchiectasis, right?

517
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,880
-Yes.

518
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,950
-You have been treated in a hospital, which hospital?

519
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:36,640
-I have all my original X-rays, my bronchograms.

520
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:49,290
-What I would like is to have now, not today, if it is possible within the next week

521
01:04:49,390 --> 01:05:03,700
to have an X-ray and compare this X-ray with the old ones and have a report from the radiologist.

522
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:10,050
Have him to evaluate the situation and give us a report.

523
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:16,280
-My chest hasn't been so good, the last three months, I'm aware of it.

524
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:22,120
I feel a smell from it but I'm aware of it.

525
01:05:22,220 --> 01:05:27,720
-But you have to check it up.
-Yes but it's better, it's not concentrated.

526
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:34,360
-We have to do the check-up and after a year to have another check up

527
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:40,460
to have an objective confirmation of what we are doing.

528
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:47,110
Which was the last hospital that you were?

529
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:52,060
-I was in the London hospital with my TB...

530
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:02,450
-How many years ago?

531
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:09,950
-In the 60's. They have put them in the museum.

532
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,550
-So you are in the museum.

533
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:20,200
That's a good case, for the museum also.

534
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:26,550
To go after 20 years to show that the lungs are in a better state.

535
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:37,220
You see all the symptoms of Tuberculinum have gone without any remedy.

536
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:45,800
Why did I ask for a RA test, rheumatoid arthritis test?

537
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:52,700
Because in this case because of the severity of the pathology, the level of pathology

538
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:58,130
it may change into a rheumatoid arthritis state.

539
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:08,790
You see clearly the direction of the pathology now is going towards the joints,

540
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:16,870
which indicates a very good direction but still it can be severe, it may be severe.

541
01:07:16,970 --> 01:07:23,120
What is the severe arthritic condition that we may have? It's rheumatoid arthritis.

542
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:28,970
That's why I checked it immediately after I had the first indications.

543
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:35,550
So they will not say he has been treating and she had rheumatoid arthritis.

544
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,050
Let's see a little bit more.

545
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,490
-Does he know that you are doing homeopathic treatment?

546
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:57,290
-Yes.

547
01:07:57,390 --> 01:08:01,840
-Does he object to that?
-No, he says do what you like.

548
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:09,890
In fact he has asked me to do some work with him for diabetes.

549
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:22,960
A friend of mine, I still have friends in the hospital, he can't believe how well I look and he

550
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:33,050
comes to see if the improvement still holds. He is amazed and he is very interested.

551
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,780
-We aroused some curiosity at least.

552
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,330
-I think we aroused it and it's nice.

553
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:55,200
-Is the rheumatoid test that you can have also? What I would like to see is the radiologist

554
01:08:55,300 --> 01:09:04,050
report, if it is possible within the next week. The other test you can have within this month.

555
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:19,800
What other things you have to note?

556
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:30,700
-I had enormous appetite and then that leveled out but now it's more...

557
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:33,030
-You tried to restrain it?

558
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:47,220
-No I couldn't restrain it and at night I felt hungry sometimes but I tried sensible food.

559
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:55,390
-Try to eat as healthy as possible, eat yogurt and fruits and salads.

560
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:03,700
-My teeth are causing me trouble. They had tremendous sensitivity

561
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:14,560
but in fact that is much better now. Now it's more one or two teeth that are sensitive.

562
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:26,980
I now have a lot more desire for cheese.

563
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:31,620
-Strong cheese or any kind of cheese?

564
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:45,200
-Basically creamy cheeses. I do like so much meat. I'm not bothered by meat.

565
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:48,710
-You don't eat it?
-I do eat it.

566
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:51,960
-You eat it but you don't desire it.

567
01:10:52,060 --> 01:11:01,710
-I used to have a steak but not now. I'm still thirsty but not as thirsty

568
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:08,930
and I wake up at night thirsty, but that's better.

569
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:27,780
You see here the symptomatology how fluctuates and eventually takes a shape?

570
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:31,380
You have to wait until it takes a shape before you can prescribe.

571
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:37,330
You let it fluctuate, thirst and no thirst, desires cheese...

572
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:45,050
You don't rush into prescribing for no substantial reason. This is the idea.

573
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:56,060
Because you may find excuses for prescribing every time, there is no question about that.

574
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:03,060
What do you think has happened with her hearing?

575
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,140
Let's see.

576
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:17,100
-Even that it's getting better.

577
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:25,300
Another thing it may come at night is to urinate, it drives me crazy.

578
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:32,050
-You have big quantities or little?
-Quite a lot.

579
01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:33,810
-And it is only during the night?

580
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:41,820
-Yes and in the day and I have stopped drinking about certain clock at night,

581
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,170
I don't drink anything and still I wake up.

582
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:50,730
-Do you have special time when you wake up?
-Not that I'm aware of.

583
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:55,500
-It can be 2-3 times?
-Yes sometimes 2-3 times, sometimes 6 times.

584
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:03,990
-It can be as many as six times?
-It can be, yes.

585
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,250
-What is your reaction to weather?

586
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:27,650
-I don't like the cold and particularly the cold and damp but today it's sunny and I'm fine,

587
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:29,900
I'm warm because it's sunny.

588
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,260
-But you don't like the cold?
-No, I don't like the cold days.

589
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:42,480
-Tell me something else and then I ask you a few things.

590
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:48,730
-I got noises that buzz in my head all day now. I used to have it but now it's there.

591
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:51,730
Sometimes it's very bad.

592
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:55,060
-What is this buzzing?
-It's like a hamming.

593
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,410
-In both ears?

594
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:01,000
-I'm not aware if it is in my ears, it seems to be in my head.

595
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:06,500
-What about your hearing?
-I think it's better.

596
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,730
-You are having your hearing aid?

597
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:13,230
-I do have it but I can carry on a conversation.

598
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:17,830
-Can you switch it off for me?
-Yes.

599
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:25,730
-Can you hear what I say now?
-Can you hear what I say?

600
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:28,580
-But you read the lips.

601
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:35,840
-Can you hear what I say now?
-Can you hear what I say?

602
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:38,480
-Can you hear?

603
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:41,190
-He said something else.

604
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:45,480
-What is your name?

605
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:47,320
-What is your name?

606
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,970
-What is your name?

607
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,580
-No. That was...

608
01:14:56,090 --> 01:15:03,570
-Where do you stay? Where do you stay?
-Where are you staying?

609
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:09,580
-I think it is improved.
-I think it's better.

610
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:24,230
The last time I was taking without the hearing aid, she could not hear at all

611
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:30,830
and she can hear quite a lot now and there is a possibility still of an improvement

612
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:36,170
as she goes on with the general improvement.

613
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:58,980
I'm afraid I tired you a little bit with the case but I wanted to show you in a long follow up,

614
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:04,480
is you don't rush to prescribe and yet you rush to prescribe when the time is right.

615
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:08,980
This is what it exemplifies this case and also it exemplifies the second difficulty,

616
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:12,480
we said what is happening to the case? Is she getting better,

617
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:16,580
is she getting worse after Graphites?

618
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:29,650
Also I would like you to understand that the cases I'm showing you

619
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:33,670
they are not a kind of selected cases.

620
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:40,820
In these seminars, where I have done mostly in America and London,

621
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:44,820
I have asked every case to come back.

622
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:56,310
And from those cases, I have seen almost 100 % of these cases back, I'm presenting to you.

623
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:59,900
It's not a selected case.

624
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:10,490
Of course here I brought a case that has a relative value concerning the problems

625
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:19,740
that I wanted to talk to you about but do not get the impression that these are selected cases.

626
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,740
No. My students have the possibility to check me in every case

627
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:33,420
and always they like to try to catch me being wrong sometimes.

628
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:42,570
Somebody put a question outside.

629
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:49,920
Dr Ross, I would like you to ask this question again in the class.

630
01:17:50,840 --> 01:18:03,000
-I asked when you give the right remedy and we have to wait.

631
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:14,000
I think we wait too long...just  give the right remedy in the good potency

632
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:23,330
and I asked you what was the result if you repeat the remedy untimely?

633
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:30,740
-The question was, if you repeat the remedy, for instance after three months,

634
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:35,740
that's the right remedy Argentum nitricum, the right potency 200 and you repeat it again,

635
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:39,340
what is going to happen after three months?

636
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:56,730
The answer is that most probably you will have unwanted reaction because don't forget

637
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:59,980
that the remedy is not indicated anymore.

638
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:06,480
Once it has started the changes within the body it's not indicated anymore.

639
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:16,750
So if you repeat it, it's like repeating a remedy that it's not indicated but it's close enough.

640
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:22,660
Therefore what you are doing, if you repeat the remedy untimely without being indicated,

641
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:29,230
you are giving a remedy that is not exactly indicated but it might be close.

642
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:33,650
Still the condition of the organism might be close to Argentum nitricum.

643
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:39,900
So therefore Argentum nitricum repeated untimely is going to stir up matters

644
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:45,750
not in a curative manner but rather in a disturbing manner.

645
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:53,490
So you will definitely get some disturbance. Whether it is big or small the disturbance,

646
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:59,490
it will depend on the strength of the constitution of the patient.

647
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:03,060
If it is a strong constitution, no problem.

648
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:08,670
A weak constitution, you can have a lot of disturbances.

649
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:20,400
Somebody else asked me whether I prescribed Tuberculinum in this case.

650
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:26,340
I didn't give this impression, I did not prescribe Tuberculinum, I did not.

651
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:30,910
The person received only Graphites and Argentum nitricum.

652
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:41,160
But we can say that in the future we may expect the possibility of Tuberculinum in this case.

653
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:49,940
But we have to wait and see that the picture of Tuberculinum is established now

654
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:58,550
and the person is really suffering and then you are justified to give Tuberculinum.

655
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:07,810
But if you give it untimely again, you may have some side effects or some unwanted effects.

656
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:21,040
Unfortunately there was... the impression has been in Homeopathy, give anything,

657
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:27,870
give any remedy. It doesn't matter, it is without side effect.

658
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:34,210
That is true but at the same time if you keep on doing these things,

659
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:41,460
you will never see on the long run real cures. Because you will be mixing up the cases.

660
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:44,710
It is not that you are going to bring a side effect like in allopathic remedy

661
01:21:44,810 --> 01:21:48,280
but you will change the symptomatology picture to the extent

662
01:21:48,380 --> 01:21:53,380
that you will not recognize it ever to give the right remedy some time.

663
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:59,030
And I have told you this many times.

664
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:12,760
In this case you heard the practitioner said I gave Hepar Sulphur, she did somewhat well,

665
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:18,860
I gave Mercury, she did somewhat well, I gave Psorinum, she did somewhat well etc.

666
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:27,350
Let's do the graph of that person so far.

667
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:34,250
Graphites was the first remedy and underneath this remedy

668
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:41,850
was the symptomatology of Argentum nitricum, which appeared.

669
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:49,100
Therefore we had there all the time a constitution of Graphites, Argentum nitricum

670
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:54,590
and a possibility of a third prescription, which is Tuberculinum.

671
01:22:56,030 --> 01:23:02,190
This is the constitution of the person on which we are acting.

672
01:23:03,950 --> 01:23:08,690
Let us say now this person develops a sciatica.

673
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:13,840
Is the sciatica going to be of the Graphites type? Very doubtful.

674
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:20,690
Most probably her sciatica will be Kali bichromicum, it develops on top of this here.

675
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:27,590
So you prescribe Kali bichromicum and she does very well for her sciatica.

676
01:23:27,690 --> 01:23:33,090
The sciatica goes away and she develops a bronchitis and in her bronchitis

677
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:40,200
she needs Bryonia and you give Bryonia and you treat.

678
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:45,600
You may treat a case year after year without ever touching the Graphites,

679
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,950
Argentum nitricum basis underneath.

680
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:55,840
This is what we have been doing many times before we realize what is going on.

681
01:23:55,940 --> 01:24:00,930
Finally the patient is not really improving after years of treatment

682
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:06,430
though the treatment appears to be successful. Because she came with a cold

683
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:10,260
and Allium cepa did so well. Immediately it disappeared.

684
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:16,500
She came with a bronchitis and Bryonia and Rhus tox took away the bronchitis beautifully,

685
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:20,370
this sciatica etc.

686
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:28,120
You treat upon a layer, what we call we treat always upon a layer, not the layer itself.

687
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:44,500
So maybe also you try to treat this layer and you give Hepar Sulphur instead of Graphites.

688
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:52,260
Because Hepar Sulphur is close, it creates some sort of disturbances or changes

689
01:24:52,360 --> 01:24:56,760
and she says I'm a little better, close to the placebo effect.

690
01:24:56,860 --> 01:25:01,510
This is not placebo effect, this is worse because the placebo effect we don't care.

691
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:09,430
If this person had come and say I feel a bit better, without deep changes,

692
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:14,420
constitutional changes, temperature changes and all these dramatic changes,

693
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:18,180
I would not take into consideration whether she was saying feeling better.

694
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:21,430
What it means feeling better? It doesn't mean anything.

695
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:30,670
What I want to see are changes and in depth. Then I know my remedy is acting.

696
01:25:30,770 --> 01:25:36,440
When a person comes and says, how are your headaches? Well I think I'm better.

697
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:42,780
Placebo, go. And next month he comes again, I have my headaches.

698
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:50,610
Natrum muriaticum, OK Sepia. Then how are you? I think now I'm really better.

699
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:58,260
This kind of thing, you can prescribe close to the case, not exact

700
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:04,340
and you may have some effect and you say better and better and worse and better

701
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:13,670
and not really touching the case where you see the rejuvenation,

702
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:16,600
the new situation that will take place.

703
01:26:18,950 --> 01:26:23,840
You see with Homeopathy we have that possibility, there is no question about that.

704
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:32,200
And we have to exploit it. The problem is to apply it properly and it's not difficult.

705
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:40,840
But it has to be applied properly. It is the most exact science that exists so far on Earth.

706
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:45,850
I'm telling you, you have to be very exact, you cannot make mistakes here and there.

707
01:26:45,950 --> 01:27:03,450
You cannot be loose about your way because you will not get these deep reactions.

708
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:07,030
You have the possibility to get them.

709
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:22,260
Also in this way you are learning because what you learned about Graphites today,

710
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:26,860
you will never learn it in any book, it's not written in the books.

711
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:35,340
You learned this kind of tiredness, this kind of combination, this pathology of the case,

712
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:40,180
the Raynaud pathology together with the lungs, together with the ear...

713
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:45,020
You get a complex pathology and you say Graphites.

714
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:00,870
No questions?

715
01:28:06,940 --> 01:28:08,680
-I have a question.

716
01:28:24,210 --> 01:28:28,910
-She was asking, she has the impression that the patient was acting differently

717
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:35,000
to the practitioner and to me, that she was giving different information.

718
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:40,910
Another thing that this question implies is that the practitioner every time she tried

719
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:47,170
to persuade me to give a remedy, so she will not be bothered by the case.

720
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:53,160
Fix her quickly so I cannot be bothered, she complains about not having energy

721
01:28:53,260 --> 01:29:01,350
and she gave her impatience about the case but facts are facts.

722
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:14,420
This is a great talent I can tell you, this is perhaps the greatest difficulty in Homeopathy.

723
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:23,520
Taking information which is real, the person does not mislead you.

724
01:29:24,290 --> 01:29:28,740
The patient usually wants quick cure, he must be treated fast,

725
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,990
he must be treated immediately, if it is possible tomorrow he must be all right.

726
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:38,080
And you have to deal with that situation. You have to deal with the anxiety of the patient

727
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:41,570
to become well completely.

728
01:29:41,670 --> 01:29:45,260
Therefore she says I don't have enough energy, give me energy

729
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:51,740
and in the meantime you see the sputum is changing colors. What it means?

730
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:57,990
For those that they have worked in hospitals, you will see the sputum how it smells

731
01:29:58,090 --> 01:30:09,580
and when we have a microorganism which is severe like the bacillus pyocyaneus,

732
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:12,430
the sputum becomes very offensive.

733
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:16,670
When it's staphylococcus it's not so smelly.
