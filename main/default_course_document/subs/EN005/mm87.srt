1
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:26,789
I would like to give you a small remedy
 but maybe very useful sometimes.

2
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:39,869
I would like to give you the main points
 of this remedy which is Dolichos.

3
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:54,049
Dolichos is mainly a right sided remedy,
 which affects mostly the liver and the skin.

4
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:10,539
Its main characteristic is very intense
 itching without an eruption.

5
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:26,719
A nervous sensitivity which comes to an exalted state, especially when we have that tremendous itching.

6
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:40,029
With this sensitivity building up in a Dolichos case, we shall have at a certain moment so much the intensity inside

7
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:48,032
and the despair because of the itching and the sensitivity that the person shouts... ah.

8
00:01:52,130 --> 00:02:09,000
You will see this state in the last stages of cancer when the bile duct is obstructed and the bile salts are circulating within the body

9
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:17,339
and then the itching is tremendous,
is unbearable and is constant.

10
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:25,199
There is no moment that there is no itching and the itching is here and you scratch and it goes there and you scratch and it goes there.

11
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:44,929
This builds up inside the individual until that sensitivity builds up so much that reaches the point where really shouts, really wants to kill himself.

12
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:57,909
We have suicidal tendencies because of
that state, despair when this comes.

13
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:08,649
There is a kind of amelioration during the day. The day is bearable but as soon as darkness starts coming down, then the itching starts.

14
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:17,659
And the itching builds up as the time goes
 by until 2,3,4,5 o'clock in the morning.

15
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,899
The individual can stay days
after days without sleep.

16
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:34,909
They are people that in the hospital they will be begging the doctor to kill them. It's such itching.

17
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:46,229
At the same time you will find something which is very peculiar to Dolichos and if you get that it's Dolichos;

18
00:03:46,230 --> 00:04:02,363
together with the itching, together with the liver being affected, the bile obstruction is there; together with that you will get irritated gums with inflammation.

19
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:16,850
And there is a pain which is deep and
prevents sleep. It will not allow you to sleep.

20
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:26,599
 If you have this kind of itching in the gums with a bit of itching in the skin also can be Dolichos.

21
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:38,019
But mostly Dolichos is when the itching in the skin because of bile salts in the blood is tremendous and the irritation on the gums is there.

22
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:44,019
These two, the combination
makes a Dolichos case.

23
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:55,099
Dolichos makes the person very restless, wants to get up from bed and move about all the time.

24
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:05,169
They cannot sit for a moment and as we said, it's worse at night, underlined 3 times and worse with warmth.

25
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:13,279
Warmth of bed, the covers of bed will intensify
 the itching and will bring up the despair.

26
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:26,629
There is an amelioration from cold water and actually what ameliorates these cases are only ...

27
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:38,769
I remember a case on a liver problem with obstruction of the bile duct during the last months of pregnancy

28
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,189
where you may get such dysfunctions
 and some problems.

29
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,989
And she was saying to her relatives to
hold her not to jump from the balcony.

30
00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:07,299
The itching was so terrible and the only thing that ameliorated it was that they would make the bed sheets wet with a solution of vinegar.

31
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:24,979
She would be wrapped up the whole night with those sheets that made a little bit of difference, that made a little bit tolerable the situation.

32
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:39,999
This intensity where you will in a hepatitis,
if you have a hepatitis which starts with itching...

33
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,869
We have two types of hepatitis,
type A and type B.

34
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:59,819
Type A is of less infective hepatitis, the less strong hepatitis and type B, where the Australian antigen is positive.

35
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:09,040
In about 5% of all cases of
 hepatitis, there is itching.

36
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:31,689
 But there is a modification of hepatitis type A, which mostly starts with itching, and it is called cholangiolytic  hepatitis.

37
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:40,929
This is hepatitis type A but the main characteristic is this tremendous itching which starts immediately with the symptoms.

38
00:07:40,930 --> 00:08:05,879
Therefore you have the urine in Dolichos, is dark, there is a constipation most of the times and if there is enema then you may get stool which is yellow.

39
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,279
But mostly there is hepatitis.

40
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:21,729
Another characteristic is that the
scratching does not relieve.

41
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,679
They will scratch and scratch and scratch and they will feel no relief from scratching.

42
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:39,919
What I'm describing has nothing to do with a
type of skin eruption that will have itching.

43
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:54,909
This itching I'm describing beyond comprehension. They will tear up the skin and then you will see blood running through.

44
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:20,379
There is much flatus with eructations, distention of abdomen with the desire to take out the clothing.

45
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:26,099
The clothing seems to be heavy.

46
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:45,199
So it's a remedy that will be prescribed mostly in hepatitis type A or in the end stages of hepatitis type B.

47
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,189
If the hepatitis is very severe sometimes will eventually go into that state of itching.

48
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:58,930
Symptoms of bile duct obstruction.

49
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:09,619
The despair, the sensitivity, the thoughts of suicide, a tremendous sensitivity which builds up, the shouting...

50
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:19,840
they shout like mad people and the desire to die, they are not afraid. They don't have fear of dying, there is no anxiety.

51
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:28,139
The only thing is the despair and they want to end their suffering by just committing suicide.

52
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:35,159
So this is a small remedy that it's going to
be very useful if you have that picture.

53
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:45,679
And it's going to act like a miracle. When the remedies are correct, you know how they act.

54
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,710
It's a plant.

55
00:10:53,950 --> 00:11:04,530
I'm talking about the potentized medicine, I'm not talking about the herb that you go and drink it.
