1
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:47,239
Primarily a rheumatic  remedy affecting the joints worse always before a storm.

2
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:57,389
Worse cold, worse wet but primarily worse before a storm. They know when a storm is coming by the pains which are coming.

3
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:11,639
The  remedy will be confused with Rhus-t.

4
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,710
Motion ameliorates.

5
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:38,919
Especially they get epididymitis swelling of testes, especially the right side very painful, better by motion.

6
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:53,919
Heels also are very sensitive, rheumatic
 pains which affect primarily the heel.

7
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,769
The heel becomes very painful in the same way as Med.

8
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:15,229
Med. has very sensitive heels in any case but it can reach a point where Med. is so sensitive in the heels

9
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,273
it's not anymore sensitivity, it's painful sensitivity, nd it is a crucifying pain to get up in the morning...

10
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:39,999
...they will go on into four, lying down before
they can get used in walking, in Med.

11
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,079
Rhod. is similar but not as strong as Med.

12
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:57,839
Another peculiar symptom is the way that they like to sleep. It's on their back with legs crossed.

13
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:25,839
The similarity with Rhus-t. is quite strong but if you see the heels sensitive or painful, then it goes immediately towards Rhod.

14
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:36,559
And of course if they say that storms are affecting them, worse before and during storms.

15
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:45,920
This sudden change of weather makes them feel very bad.

16
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:56,160
They can be also psychologically down with this weather, before a storm.

17
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,879
That's why they develop fear of storms. Faintness, confusion, excitement before storm.

18
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:14,679
We don't know much about the psychological state but when you use this  remedy, usually we don't have much

19
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,969
psychological symptoms. It's a rheumatic, arthritic  remedy and these people who are suffering with

20
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:32,439
rheumatism, with arthritis, they are quite  balanced people in their mental emotional.

21
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:50,219
It's a very good thing, for instance, treating somebody who is mentalized to see eventually the joints

22
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,209
being involved into the disease.

23
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:05,689
That's a very good sign, the same way that for another case would be a good sign to see a skin eruption.

24
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:18,359
So when you get these cases and they will tell you these few symptoms, either inflammation on the testes

25
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:31,329
or epididymitis or inflammation in the heels or worse before or during storms they are quite healthy people

26
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,599
belonging usually to the first group.

27
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,359
We have quite a different way of evaluating diseases.

28
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:54,080
Where somebody says, 'my child was never sick'.

29
00:05:54,081 --> 00:06:10,919
I say, oh my God! Otherwise the child is very healthy. I say, yes very healthy.

30
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:20,720
I remember a case of an autistic child I treated for 8 years.

31
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,169
The child was not able to perform anything.

32
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:37,119
When he came to the office, we had some curtains and in no time the curtains were down, he just pulled them.

33
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,639
It was very strong.

34
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:55,839
It was like an animal, treated for 8 years. Then I lost this case, they didn't follow anymore and the last I remember

35
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,809
 was when he came out with crops of words.

36
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:14,599
Manifested out of nowhere. It was very interesting. And the child was able after that to perform, to self-support.

37
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:32,559
He started playing with clay and he would go an buy things. His mother would say, go and bring me bread.

38
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:40,539
He would give the money, give me bread, he would take the bread, take it back.

39
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:52,469
To that extent I remember out of 8 years of treating this child, very difficult cases, autistic children.

40
00:07:53,310 --> 00:08:01,835
But it was very interesting the great relief that came when finally the words came back.

41
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:12,969
-May I ask you a question? In the mentally retarded children how do you know that you should repeat the  remedy?

42
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,039
 By what symptom?

43
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:33,879
I have a case of Bar-c. and the child before had never been sick and after Bar-c. it developed a cold and angina...

44
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:47,399
...and the parents didn't tell me. They went to another doctor and they gave antibiotics and after this

45
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:53,309
 I repeated the  remedy and again an angina followed and a bronchitis.

46
00:08:53,310 --> 00:09:05,859
The child gets Ritalin because of hyper activity and they have to make and EEG every now and then.

47
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:13,439
After some months the EEG was normal and before it was always been slow down and it's articulating

48
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,199
a little bit better but I have no idea when to repeat or how high I should repeat.

49
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:32,969
-In such cases you can repeat high and you can repeat a lot. You can repeat 10M every day until he has a reaction.

50
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:46,719
But, for instance, let us say the child develops angina. You see the symptoms and if the symptoms fall

51
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:56,559
within Bar-c., you continue. Otherwise it's better to stop the  remedy and don't give anything.

52
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:04,289
 I mean don't give Bell. or other remedies we give in such cases because you may just spoil the action.

53
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:12,569
Like antibiotics, it was very bad. That they gave antibiotics in such a case. It's a pity.

54
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:24,339
-When you said that this autistic kid had these warts and it connected actually to Thuja and normally people say

55
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:36,219
and I found out that in the few I know and they are autistic, they became autistic after they get the vaccinations.

56
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:44,329
And it's connecting the Thuja again after certain vaccinations.

57
00:10:50,880 --> 00:11:09,139
-I didn't say that the child was autistic because these warts were.... I didn't say that, I don't know.

58
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,799
But autistic children are very difficult condition to treat.

59
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:32,929
-I'm not quite sure if I understood you right. Did you say that the arthritic pains ....

60
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:43,189
-Arthritic pains if they are brought out in a mental case, it's a very good sign, as skin eruptions.

61
00:11:48,520 --> 00:12:03,599
You have to rejoice when they say 'my ankles are swollen and my foot is swollen' then you have to be careful.

62
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:12,759
The idea is that you know what you are doing and you don't make so many mistakes. This is the idea.

63
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:20,199
Once you know what's going on, you don't make so many mistakes. Wait, it's a good reaction, you explain.

64
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:24,439
The patient will be patient.

65
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:37,039
If you explain and if you give a logical reason why you do this and why you do that, they will understand most of them.

66
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,799
If they don't understand it's their problem, it's not your problem. Your problem is to explain to them and to show

67
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,279
 that you know and you feel comfortable.

68
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:56,839
'Ah! What is this doctor? I can't live, I have my wrist'......'Yes, I know'.

69
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:24,679
I will give you a remedy which is seldom indicated but it is an interesting remedy.

70
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:33,039
A remedy hich is full of life, energy, excitement.

71
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,790
And a lot of angriness, angry.  pulsation.

72
00:13:46,180 --> 00:14:00,879
And a remedy that produces disturbances in
 the circulation, it reminds one of  Tarent., of Bell.

73
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:14,889
And which ends up in having a malignant tumor, especially breast.

74
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,559
Cancer of breast is one of the remedies that we have to consider.

75
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:37,419
In the night they get excited and full of emotions and then it goes down and feel depressed.

76
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:45,400
A remedy which is very quarrelsome like Tarent.

77
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:51,319
They say after mental exertions, the brain feels agitated.

78
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:06,239
You can perceive the disturbance on the circulation.

79
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:19,319
Very emotional people. If they become upset, everything is worse.

80
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:35,189
Also you will see during the climacteric period, where again it stops suddenly this flow of blood and the circulation changes

81
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:48,589
this is the period where Aster. can show up tumors, can show up troubles, can show up insanity and delusions.

82
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:56,269
They have different types of delusions, hear voices, see faces etc.

83
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:18,240
There is also a delusion which is similar to Bry. They feel that they are away from home and they'll say

84
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:20,439
 'I would like to go home'.

85
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:35,759
You will see the effect on the reproductive organs and also the effect on the sexual desire which is increased

86
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:53,720
 it's much aggressive. Aggressive sexual desire that is not satisfied with normal sexual activity.

87
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,719
They need something else. You perceive the heart of the remedy.

88
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:08,989
The tumor breaking out, the circulation, the excitement, the night excitement, the sexual energy

89
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,579
the quarrelsome, the irritability, the anger inside.

90
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:23,579
This kind of people you will see that are similar to Tarent. or Bell.

91
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:30,329
There is a time of aggravation which is just before the Lyc. aggravation.

92
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:42,079
Lyc. is 4 to 8. That is before that, 2 to 4. That is the time of aggravation.

93
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,089
And aggravation in the night, in bed.

94
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:56,329
You will have headaches, epileptic fits that take place around that time, 2,3,4.

95
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:05,949
Each remedy has peculiarities and you will see in this remedy a symptom which is peculiar

96
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:15,400
 anxiety on the upper part of the abdomen.
Felt on the upper part of the abdomen.

97
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:29,269
 We have anxiety arising from stomach and this is a symptom I have seen very frequently with Ars.

98
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:38,359
You go a little bit higher and you see anxiety from stomach and you think of Ars.

99
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:48,359
This remedy is not as restless as Ars.
and it's not as cold as Ars.

100
00:18:48,360 --> 00:19:01,989
An interesting symptom also is that epileptic fits are preceded by a kind of twitching.

101
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:11,529
 Twichings all over the body, they may have here, here, here. 2,3 days before the attack.

102
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:20,789
Still it's a small remedy that you will use,
 you will find it's picture very seldom.

103
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:33,039
Don't get the idea that you will get a case like this tomorrow when you go back home.

104
00:19:46,280 --> 00:20:01,089
It has the feeling of the uterus pushing out like Sep., Lil-t. but not as strong as these remedies.

105
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:09,599
In Lil-t. and Sep. is very strong. Here it's much less in intensity.

106
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:21,889
The idea is that you have to get this excitable and quarrelsome and irritable and a person with a lot of

107
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:27,579
emotional and circulatory turmoil. This is the idea.

108
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:45,010
If you get a sedate person with delusions and problems in climacteric, fear of insanity, insanity etc. you don't think of Aster.

109
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:20,039
When you read the proving of this  remedy, you realize that this is a person who has abused sexual energy.

110
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:44,830
You get people who become impotent and because of that impotency they become depressed

111
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:59,400
 dissatisfied, despondent.  At the same time there is an arousal of anxiety, especially concerning their health.

112
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,910
Sexual melancholy, you understand what it means?

113
00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:16,409
'I cannot have sex, I do not have the potency though I like it'.

114
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:26,479
Now we have the solution. What is the solution? Viagra! Not Agn.

115
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:47,870
You first try Agn. before Viagra. It may help better.

116
00:22:47,871 --> 00:22:53,699
 They are individuals who are broken down in their constitutions.

117
00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:06,649
The first thing that breaks down is the memory. They forget words, they forget what they want to do, they forget names.

118
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:18,059
They are absent minded, they cannot concentrate.

119
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:31,159
They try to read and they read the words and nothing sticks inside. You see the weakness of the brain.

120
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:39,800
-We all need it.

121
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:55,480
 -Yes, why not. Especially homeopaths who concentrate too much on their work, they become totally destroyed.

122
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:14,359
Over exertion. In Homeopathy there are some of my students, when they find the remedy, they say

123
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:20,260
how many orgasms did you have today? How many times you found the correct  remedy ?

124
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:31,469
So Agn. after that because you have a sexual hyper activity with Homeopathy.

125
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,729
I got the  remedy !

126
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:55,639
Interesting also it has a symptom like Arg-n. where they say, 'I'm finished, I'm going to die' and many times

127
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:06,029
 they will even say, 'I think in two months I'm finished. I'm going to die'.

128
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:13,119
You must have heard me saying this many times.

129
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:24,739
Delusions of smell, also of herring the fish.

130
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:43,129
History of repeated gonorrheas. You understand the type of the person, a lot of activities, a lot of enjoyment

131
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,609
and then enjoyment stops.

132
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:55,629
Absence of disappearance of milk in nursing women often with great sadness, she says she will die.

133
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:06,119
The milk does not come and then this degradation of the organism.

134
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:20,969
You see the peculiarity between Aster., it makes the whole system to build up in energy.

135
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:30,359
The other one it brings it down and still the end result will be the same. Death is coming near.

136
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:41,879
This remedy feels that it's near, it's not actually physical death, it's a feeling that the deterioration which I feel

137
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:47,889
 in the way I feel, I'm going to die, maybe tomorrow or in two months.

138
00:26:47,890 --> 00:27:05,859
This is the idea. With Aster. also you will see in tumors which they develop in very vital people with a lot of energy

139
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:15,239
 a lot of sexual activity and if you enquire about their sexual activity you'll find out that it's not just normal sexual activity.

140
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,784
 It will be quite a lot of other things.

141
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:29,879
In the end you get the tumor, in the breast usually. But it can be in the uterus, in the ovaries.

142
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,669
Asterias affects the reproductive organs.

143
00:27:45,880 --> 00:28:06,779
Here in Agn., again the tubes that bring the milk stop and the woman goes into depression. She feels she is going to die.

144
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:18,970
Parts cold and relaxed, the sexual organs
are cold and relaxed. Total impotency.

145
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,799
 Many times also the desire is totally gone.

146
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:34,899
With these remedies you just have to remember the essence. If you get the essence then it sticks in the mind

147
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:41,239
 then the moment you will see the patient, something will remind you.

148
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:54,199
George was talking about it, a.... you go to all the a, asterias, that's it. Many times I found remedies like this

149
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,219
because it's not possible to remember everything.

150
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:14,839
-In the rubric, 'tells the time of his death', can you make an addition of this remedy because it's not contained in the rubric?

151
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:32,759
-Yes, predicts, foretells. You can make an addition. It's not there? In the Repertory?

152
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,229
-Which degree?

153
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:55,989
-Second degree you can put it but it's not in the Repertory already?

154
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:13,850
It has to be, just look in your Repertories.

155
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:28,839
-The Germans have the name monk's pepper for this  remedy.

156
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:48,830
-Very interesting also it means in Greek being a pure person. In Greek 'Agnos' means a person who is pure.

157
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:58,729
So most probably the monks were doing a proving of the mother tincture. They took the remedy

158
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:05,759
to lower their desire for sex and make them impotent.

159
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:16,119
 It's a proving, they used it as a proving. The same way like women in Brazil I heard also.

160
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:32,439
 They used the frog's substance from the glands, the bufo, they used to give it to their husband, without

161
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:41,929
the husband knowing what he is taking with his coffee in order to stop them from being so active with them.

162
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:46,369
 They said, I had enough, take some bufo.

163
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:56,839
-Would it not be good time now to differentiate the different impotence remedies?

164
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:01,089
-They are too many.

165
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:24,919
We have from early ejaculation to total impotency but I don't think I can do it now. I have to prepare.

166
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:39,549
-He said in Germany it's common that gynecologists take preparations concerning Agn.

167
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:45,119
but what he meant is that they prescribe preparations that contain Agn.

168
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:53,760
I had a patient who was taking this preparation for about 3-4 months...

169
00:32:53,761 --> 00:33:04,259
...and she fell into absolute deep depression and had the typical symptom that she will die soon now.

170
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:11,079
And that's why I told this woman and I try to spread it to all my other female patients that they really

171
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,089
have to be careful in using these preparations.

172
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:19,319
-Why they give it? On what indications?

173
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:30,769
-Troubles from the breast. And swelling of the breast.

174
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:51,419
-The gynecologist say it's so called herbal female hormone and it's used as such. A plant female hormone.

175
00:33:51,420 --> 00:34:03,159
-Female hormone. So do they give it in excess of male hormones?

176
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:18,669
-No, not as a counteraction to male hormones but it's used if women have pain in the breast before menses

177
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:26,449
 if they have menstrual problems meaning too frequent or long menses, strong menses.

178
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:33,560
Also if they have the menses too infrequent.

179
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:41,239
But especially for premenstrual syndrome.

180
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:49,279
It's frequently given during menopause instead of hormones without any big differentiation.

181
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,279
-Just because they are on climacteric.

182
00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:03,359
-Usually it's prescribed as mother tincture and I assume that this patient was especially sensitive to it.

183
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,239
I have not seen this reaction to other patients.

184
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:21,559
-It's very interesting the confirmation of the 'predicts the time of death'. It's very interesting in that case.

185
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:30,219
-It's just as the colleague said before. Usually it's used generally for the so called hormonal disturbances.

186
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:45,959
-It is interesting since it's prescribed, I didn't know it was prescribed so widely in Germany, but it's interesting

187
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:55,709
 from these side effects, whatever it comes to your attention to collect the side effects and to write precisely

188
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,959
 what the person feels and to have it published.

189
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:11,799
This was one of our ideas concerning provings and this is a very good way of proving. Because out of the population

190
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:20,159
I just had an enquiry from England, the Complementary Medicine Association.

191
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:31,739
They asked this question. Let us say, in a population of 10.000 people, how many do you think

192
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:47,452
will be sensitive to Bell., Rhus-t. and Puls.? They put a question to me.

193
00:36:51,390 --> 00:37:02,379
Theoretically if we had the possibility to give it. Bell. 30 to the 10.000 population, how many will develop some symptoms?

194
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,739
What is the answer?

195
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:25,079
Of course the answer is we cannot know but there is a measurement for somebody who has seen a lot of cases.

196
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:36,479
And the measurement is how many of my cases are Bell., Rhus-t. and Puls.?

197
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:46,649
So the answer I gave is about 20-50 at the most out of 10.000.

198
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:55,839
This is the same thing with Agn.  Giving Agn. in a population of let us say 50.000, you may have

199
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:05,819
30 cases in which you will see some side effects and these are very interesting cases.

200
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:15,719
And this is my objection concerning the type of provings which are done in contemporary provings

201
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:23,099
and are written in a book. You give a dose of 12C and you have thousands of symptoms.

202
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:30,580
 How is that possible that everyone in the group develops symptoms?

203
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:42,259
It's not possible, it's totally impossible. Therefore a lot of these provings are false. The information is false.

204
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:54,919
Out of the group maybe one person will bring out a real symptom. So out of 1000 symptoms, perhaps 5-6 symptoms

205
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:01,549
 out of 1 person may be belonging really to the  remedy.

206
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:15,199
- About the feeling of death is usually said that at the end of orgasm there is a feeling of a small death.

207
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,959
So maybe that feeling is extending in that case ....

208
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:33,119
-You are a philosopher but if you ask the experience of many people, especially women and men

209
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:43,601
they will say I feel rejuvenated after the orgasm. It is a matter of the organism, how it will react.

210
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:53,409
An organism will feel rejuvenated, another one will feel very depleted and maybe even with this idea.

211
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:08,639
But from a theoretical point of view you can say that you give the possibility of life for continuation and at the same time

212
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:18,360
 you are getting older and you are going away, that is true. From a theoretical point of view, in actuality, it doesn't happen.
