1
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:46,590
What is interesting with this remedy is the following. This is a remedy that sweats a lot. Is dreched in sweat.

2
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:59,729
But as soon as it goes to sleep, the sweat dries out and the skin becomes dry and burning.

3
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:18,199
Therefore there is no elimination and there are two points of sensitivity for Samb. One is the respiratory system

4
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:33,740
 and it gets the impact of the non-elimination to the perspiration. The boy goes to bed...

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:49,929
...in the day time the perspiration is flowing, he goes to bed at 10 o'clock and at 10.30  the perspiration

6
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:59,239
 is totally stopped, once he has been in sleep and there is no elimination.

7
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:17,259
At 12 o'clock, 12.30, 1,1.30 even 2 o'clock this child will wake up with a tremendous dyspnea. It becomes very soon bluish.

8
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:33,519
The perspiration starts again as soon as he wakes up with the dyspnea, the perspiration starts again

9
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,249
but the dyspnea will continue the whole night.

10
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:45,079
It is one of these remedies that they will tell you what time is the dyspnea, they say the whole night.

11
00:02:45,080 --> 00:03:00,639
Actually it is not the whole night, it is after a few hours of sleep. This is the idea. In the Repertory maybe you will find

12
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:08,559
after 12 difficulty of breathing, asthmatic breathing, after 12.

13
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:20,509
The idea is that this elimination has to stop through some hours of sleep and then the lungs, which are sensitive

14
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:30,840
 take the impact. Of course, as you may understand, this is happening why? Because at the same time

15
00:03:30,841 --> 00:03:42,519
there is a sensitivity on the kidneys. The kidneys do not eliminate properly and that is why we may have also

16
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:52,700
a kidney problem with swelling of extremities. Especially of the lower extremities.

17
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:09,939
We have also suffocative attacks after fright. The child gets frightened and then it cannot breathe.

18
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:27,199
The difficulty is so strong, it is one of the worst asthma remedies, the difficulty is so strong and sudden

19
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:33,599
that there is a fear, an anxiety arising together with this suffocative attack.

20
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:50,879
Also Samb. has the tendency to dry up the natural discharges of upper respiratory, to dry up the nose

21
00:04:50,880 --> 00:05:11,559
 to close it and the person feels suffocating and nursing children, they cannot take the food from the milk of the mother.

22
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:26,279
Characteristic is, as we said, during waking hours there's a lot of perspiration but not so much in the head

23
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:41,439
 the perspiration is in the body. It is one of the most perspiring remedies during the asthmatic attacks.

24
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:57,699
In cases where you will find a combination of kidney problems with asthmatic attacks, this is a remedy that has

25
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:10,559
 to be thought immediately. But as I said, what you have to remember is the dryness of the skin. So much dry that

26
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:21,269
is burning during sleep but once he wakes up he is drenched in sweat.

27
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,980
That means very much but not so much in the head.

28
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:33,679
The difficulty mostly is on expiration, not so much in inspiration.

29
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,480
The lungs seem not to have the power to put out the air.

30
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:45,549
 That's all you have to remember about that remedy. If you remember, you will recognize it.

31
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:56,729
-Is it mainly a children's remedy?
-Children because children today, you know the statistics.

32
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:10,399
Today the children of Europe and America are getting asthmatic attacks in tremendous numbers.

33
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:20,469
There are statistics that say 40% of the children they have some kind of asthmatic conditions.

34
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:38,039
Also there is evidence that this epidemic it has been produced by pertussis by the DPT vaccination.

35
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:50,239
And there are statistics that say that children which are vaccinated in some areas, the come up to 18%

36
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,689
of the vaccinated children, they have asthmatic attacks.

37
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:06,439
Where unvaccinated of the same country, they come up to 2% or even less.

38
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:26,239
It is very interesting that there is a study which says that if the children together with DPT, they are vaccinated

39
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:38,479
with BCG they don't get it. The percentage of those children who get asthma is much less.

40
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:53,399
So from one hand they make sick the children by giving the pertussis, instead of having the whooping cough

41
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:09,041
the acute and allowing the organism to develop antibodies and not being so easily affected by environmental conditions

42
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,819
instead of allowing this to happen, they don't allow the body to do that and the body does not develop

43
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:25,404
and then with the least provocation, it has a cold, it has an influenza, it ends up to asthma.

44
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:43,449
But then they say, if you give BCG to these children, it is the product from tuberculin, this percentage is much less.

45
00:09:43,450 --> 00:10:00,039
So actually it is interesting that we counteract this cough or this asthma with Tub. and perhaps an idea will be

46
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:12,049
 if they give children BCG and the children start coughing and start having chronic problems, maybe Tub. 200

47
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:18,239
 will be an antidote. Because they antidote the one with the other.

48
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:29,999
They antidote the side effects of pertussis with BCG and there is a total confusion, they don't know what they are doing.

49
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:39,079
There is a debate finally  which is going on these levels. Finally, after me speaking for the last 30 years.

50
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:47,079
They have come to the point where they realized maybe they are right.

51
00:10:48,320 --> 00:11:05,959
It is difficult for one who is breathing with difficulty to differentiate but sometimes they will be able to say, it is difficult.

52
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:11,469
It's not so easy to tell but sometimes they can tell you.

53
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:24,199
And worse lying down especially with the head low. It makes very difficult the breathing, they have to sit up.

54
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:45,410
Use Sabad. mostly in hay fever.

55
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:56,289
Where the nose, the pharynx, the trachea are affected mostly.

56
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:11,519
It is the upper respiratory tract which is affected and the characteristic is the spasmodic, violent sneezing

57
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:26,669
which comes  together with excessive lacrimation. You see repeated attacks of sneezing, the eyes are running.

58
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,909
I'll get symptoms of Sabad. very soon.

59
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:54,079
It's a cold remedy which is ameliorated by having something warm in the stomach. Warm drinks are desired and ameliorate.

60
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:04,979
They don't like cold drinks, warm coverings, warm drinks make the person feel better.

61
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:13,729
They go into the open air and as soon as the air blows the sneezing starts, the paroxysmal sneezing

62
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,979
starts and then there is a tremendous lacrimation.

63
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,729
Sabad. is known for something else which is characteristic in the mind.

64
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:47,479
It is known to have peculiar sensations about her body. Not like Bar-c. that the body is not harmonious

65
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:56,349
'I have too big breast or too big hips'.

66
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:08,639
Bar-c. always, even if they are thin, they will feel big, the hips are fat. This is different with Sabad.

67
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:18,969
Sabad. feels that maybe parts are shrunk or parts are elongated.

68
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:32,939
They will feel the nose is big, they have a big chin, the eyes are bulgy or are shrunk in.

69
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:42,199
These ideas in the mind are very peculiar of this remedy.

70
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:58,389
Another area of action is worms in children. Worms in the intestines.

71
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:11,619
And it's a peculiar symptom also that sometimes they feel there is a worm here in the mouth.

72
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,479
  There is this sensation that there is a worm moving in the pharynx.

73
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:27,449
Hypochondriac people, feeling always that there is something wrong with their health and feeling also that

74
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:33,359
their case most probably is incurable.

75
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:51,679
They have quite strong fear of death, fear of devil and fear of water.

76
00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:08,899
and sometimes it arouses the passion in a woman and you can see nymphomania. They are quite passionate.

77
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:14,720
Very strong nails, difficult to cut.

78
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:35,759
Sensation of a lump in the throat, it can be a sensation of mucus or a sensation of something hanging.

79
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:57,769
Like a bundle of hair, not one hair. One hair is different, the sensation of one hair is Kali-bi. and Sil. mostly.

80
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:12,229
They need to swallow to get it out or hawk it which makes it difficult.

81
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:23,649
But what you have to remember is the sudden explosive sneezing with a lot of lacrimation, running nose

82
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:43,319
with heat which comes to the head and in spite of that, they are ameliorated by warm drinks, warm coverings.

83
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,640
Sabad. will suffer in the open air.

84
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:04,119
Especially when the air is cold. When it's hot the air and it's little, no.

85
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:21,309
And we have convulsions in children from worms. You know that worms can produce convulsions.

86
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:37,309
When I was in India I had seen a terrible case of convulsion which had actually died from convulsions.

87
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:50,649
He was in a state with tremendous amount of pinworms and he was in spasm and eventually he stuck there.

88
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:05,769
India was an experience because in India the idea of life or death is different than we have here.

89
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:16,419
They gave irrelevant remedies totally, I was battling to give the remedy, I was sure the child could be saved

90
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:25,990
they say no the Professor said to give this remedy. I said OK the child will die like a typhus case.

91
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:38,899
It will be very interesting for us to have a hospital and to see the hospital cases and to show what Homeopathy

92
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:41,650
 can do in hospital cases.

93
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:52,529
 It will be very interesting, I can tell you they are going to have a shock. Because they don't want to see

94
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,099
 these cases we treat, they don't want to hear about.

95
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:10,089
You say, I vaccinated my child and my child was paralyzed two days later and they say, no, no, don't even talk about it.

96
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:12,969
You lose your job.

97
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:25,679
I was seeing a documentary for the people on the war in Iraq.

98
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:53,379
There is this syndrome, the syndrome of the gulf war and I saw people paralyzed, young soldiers they are paralyzed.

99
00:20:53,380 --> 00:21:01,949
The doctors who investigated their cases they almost lost their job. The files of the soldiers were lost.

100
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:19,829
They don't want to see and it's such a big evidence that the uranium of the bombs that are throwing now in Kosovo

101
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:30,729
the same bombs were thrown there. And thousands of soldiers were affected.

102
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:40,539
Who were affected? Mostly those who have been vaccinated against the gases, the poisonous gases.

103
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,520
They were afraid that Sadam would throw some poisonous gases.

104
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:07,169
And after by mistake they bombed their own tanks. When they went to check the radiation was so much

105
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:21,590
that a mission came from America. People dressed like astronauts and were covering this with sand.

106
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:32,449
They dig to put into the sand all these tanks
that were bombarded by the uranium bombs.

107
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:41,339
Because the radiation was so much and after burying them they go over the place and still the radiation

108
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:52,029
was tremendous! And people now are dying and there is a whole big thing in America but you see how they tried

109
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:56,239
again and again to cover up the whole story.

110
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:06,519
They don't want to listen what we say, they don't want to investigate the idea of vaccination.

111
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:19,719
They get numbers and statistics which are not well researched.

112
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:29,959
As far as I know there are more soldiers suffering from the syndrome than those who are actually affected

113
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,679
by some kind of radiation through bombing.

114
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:42,909
From what I heard, when they prepared for the war there is also that they tested all kinds of new vaccinations on the soldiers.

115
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:47,069
There was a mass vaccination. Everybody who went to the gulf had to be vaccinated.

116
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,489
-The Americans and the English. Not the other nations.

117
00:23:50,490 --> 00:24:01,409
-But the Americans I can remember that they said it and these vaccinations had never been tried out before.

118
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:08,391
So whatever reactions you see, whether radiation or no, can also be reactions to the vaccine itself.

119
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:16,959
-This is correct, this is what I said. Those who were vaccinated were the worst victims.

120
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:31,839
They said that they threw the bombs and there was a lot of dust coming up and people came with their clothes.

121
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:46,399
One of the men who was suffering was a nurse, a doctor, undressing the people from the battle and taking

122
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:58,969
the dust of their clothes into her clothes and checking out the radiation, it was tremendous in the doctors' clothes.

123
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:13,339
It's a whole big documentary. Now with all these facts, all these people talking, doctors who try to investigate

124
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:19,559
 how they lost their job, how the files were lost, how nobody knows what happened.

125
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:30,839
You ask information about these people and this doctor said, I received telephone calls who said, give up your patients.

126
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,089
And he said, I'm a doctor how can I give up my patients?

127
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:48,249
And they threatened him and finally he lost his position because these were doctors paid by the government or the military.

128
00:25:50,530 --> 00:26:03,079
-With the actions on Kosovo now, they are actions in the U.S. to start to prepare ground groups for activity in Kosovo.

129
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:13,039
And because of the gulf war syndrome which many doctors and soldiers believe were induced by vaccinations

130
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:22,759
the many vaccinations that were given and the fact that their perspiration was suppressed, they used special suits

131
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:31,640
 to protect against these nerve gases that were supposed to be used which by the way they were supplied by the US.

132
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:41,543
 But the suppression of the perspiration with the vaccination is what they believe caused the problem.

133
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:49,879
And now there are soldiers in the US who are refusing to be vaccinated for action in Kosovo.

134
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:57,689
And there is a big controversy now in the Military whether the Military can force them to take vaccinations.

135
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:03,599
And there is a law suit going on.

136
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:11,959
-But you see in a country like America which is supposed to be the most free, the most democratic

137
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:22,010
everybody does whatever he likes, then it comes to the real problem, everything can be suppressed.

138
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,770
 it's a terrifying thought!

139
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,460
We are guinea pigs.
