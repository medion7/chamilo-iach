1
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:27,690
I would like to talk about Capsicum.

2
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:37,920
Capsicum is a remedy which is not used as it should

3
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,930
because there was no enough information about it

4
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:56,110
and reading the books actually there are not enough keynotes or precise information to use it.

5
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:11,920
What I noticed from observation all these years is that Capsicum can be indicated

6
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:22,100
in two different situations, in two different psychological make up,

7
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,360
which I think the one can follow the other or can be completely independent.

8
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,100
Before we go the psychological make-up

9
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:39,840
I would give you the physical characteristics of Capsicum which you will usually see.

10
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,600
The great keynote of Capsicum is obesity.

11
00:01:48,140 --> 00:02:00,920
This is a peculiar obesity where the people feel that they put on weight so fast

12
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,800
that everything that they eat it turns to double the amount of food that they have taken.

13
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:17,510
What is also peculiar is that the stomach feels like a heavy sack

14
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:24,350
which is bloating from one day after another day.

15
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:43,010
Before I go further I want to make clear certain things.

16
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:50,500
When I'm talking about a remedy, I'm talking with the idea

17
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:59,320
that this remedy is the basic remedy of the person.

18
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:12,670
Sometimes you will get an added remedy on the top, as I explained you the other day.

19
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:20,430
What is going to happen in this case and what is the difference with that case

20
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:27,680
is that with this added layer you will see, when you give the remedy,

21
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:35,190
you will see certain of the suffering of the person goes away but quite a lot stays behind.

22
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:42,680
That is an added remedy, that is after antibiotics this Capsicum state is developed.

23
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,670
You go and give that Capsicum it takes away this flabbiness, whatever we talk about

24
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,170
and quite a lot of what we shall be talking about and then comes to the next level,

25
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:59,620
which is quite still suffering, the person is still not well.

26
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:07,580
But when we give a remedy here with Capsicum and we give it for that level,

27
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:18,770
then the changes which you observe are much more intense and deep and complete.

28
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,340
In all literature, in Kent and others, they speak about remedies

29
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,080
which if you don't know what to do, there is no symptomatology,

30
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,340
then you may think of Sulphur of clearing up the case,

31
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,070
then you may think of Thuja of clearing up a case; you know that idea.

32
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:54,310
Then you may think of Tuberculinum clearing up a case.

33
00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:02,310
The clearing up of a case is actually this idea that there is a layer on top

34
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,510
which goes away with Sulphur, Thuja, whatever it is and when the next layer appear

35
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,490
and you can see it more clearly, the same happens with Capsicum.

36
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,990
Capsicum is one of the remedies that you may need as first remedy to prescribe,

37
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,330
to clear up the way.

38
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,670
Any remedy picture can come on top.

39
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:39,070
In such cases you don't get a really deep reaction but with second remedy

40
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,420
you get the best possible results.

41
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:52,820
When I described a Capsicum, I described it not on that level, on the lower level,

42
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,410
the typical Capsicum.

43
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,000
On this level you will see hints of what we are talking about now, not the full picture

44
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,330
but some hints.

45
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,990
So we see that we are impressed by that obesity,

46
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:20,150
which obesity now is coupled with an appearance which is quite unique again.

47
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:34,900
There is a flabbiness in the skin with a redness which is coming up

48
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:46,740
because of little fine veins appearing into the skin.

49
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:58,580
There is another appearance which looks like Capsicum, the drunk is the most close

50
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,560
description of a Capsicum face.

51
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:08,070
Bring that two degrees down, as far as intensity is concerned,

52
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:18,480
you know drunk is with huge nose and rough, I don't mean to that extend.

53
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:26,740
Bring this degree down, bring this intensity down and you will make a face of Capsicum.

54
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:39,030
So that tremendous obesity which has that feeling

55
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:48,430
that there is no strong fibers to hold back the intestines.

56
00:07:48,530 --> 00:08:01,180
You feel that there is a flabbiness and then there is a sensitivity to cold.

57
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:11,440
So you get these persons that they will complain that they put on weight so easily,

58
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:20,430
they are so chilly and everything they eat, it turns to fat

59
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,530
and immediately you give them Calcarea carbonica.

60
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:38,930
What you will attain with Calc carbonica, what you will make in such a case,

61
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:44,180
what they will tell you when they come back? A Capsicum who takes Calc carbonica comes back

62
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:52,280
and gives you a report. He actually will say, I now have a better appetite.

63
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:01,290
And you will see they have put on some more kilos.

64
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:11,430
This is the predisposition towards the obesity and you stimulate in a remedy

65
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:18,030
which is very close producing obesity and you just make things a little bit worse.

66
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,690
Now you say I made a mistake, you go back, you look in the Repertory you see chilly

67
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:33,770
and easily tired, because they get easily tired and you give what? Ferrum metallicum.

68
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:45,360
Ferrum metallicum will make them feel a little bit more tired and a little bit more with palpitation.

69
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:51,060
They will come back and they will give you this report until finally you come to the point

70
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,040
and you say, see this face.

71
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,440
There is no face here that I can show you but I hope you understood more or less

72
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,520
what I'm talking about.

73
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:12,510
You put things together again, you say the chilliness, the tiredness, maybe is Capsicum

74
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:19,720
but now you want some more information about the person, about the psychological make-up

75
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:25,620
to secure that this is a case of Capsicum really.

76
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,030
What is the psychological make-up of Capsicum?

77
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:54,790
Capsicum are very sensitive people, very easily insulted, they feel easily criticism.

78
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:11,690
And they are very much aware of the opinion of others towards them.

79
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:24,290
Actually to survive they need the good opinion of others about themselves.

80
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:33,540
When they feel they are criticized, they go into a state of (?)

81
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:52,940
But the great mental characteristic of Capsicum is actually a sensitivity

82
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,290
which has a peculiar direction.

83
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:09,180
They get into state where a tremendous feeling of nostalgia overtakes the person.

84
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:19,180
They go into (?) of that kind of feeling. They leave in the past actually

85
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:28,680
and the events of the past take such, big part of their feelings

86
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:36,950
and the feelings are aroused to such an extend that they feel they can not live anymore.

87
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,780
They are overtaken by that nostalgia of the past.

88
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:55,030
They live in Seattle, they live in Connecticut but their years of childhood were in Washington,

89
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,010
so when they think of Washington and the events there which they are taking place,

90
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,770
they have great nostalgia. I must go back.

91
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,200
But they might go back to something which is lost.

92
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:16,020
This nostalgia comes because there was a love affair which was taking place in Washington

93
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:26,930
and the love affair was so unique that now they are in Seattle they think about it

94
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,430
and that becomes a tremendous thing.

95
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:37,450
A tremendously hurtful experience, not hurtful from the standpoint

96
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,930
that it was not happy by that time, no.

97
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:50,280
It was very nice and now there is something that they can not get it back

98
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:56,920
and how they are going to live now? The feelings are tremendously aroused,

99
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:05,840
as if the past becomes idealized, becomes absolutely...

100
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:12,170
There are no bad things happening in the past, all the past was beautiful.

101
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,170
What is happening now is very bad but the past was very beautiful and it comes up

102
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:21,520
and overtakes them and it is a feeling as if they can not live.

103
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:29,920
I had a medical doctor, a very nice man. You wouldn't understand that he was sensitive.

104
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:42,500
He was very social, very laughing person, with jokes and all that and he came once

105
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,800
and said to me, I don't feel well, I have depression and I have anxiety and all this

106
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,900
and I have that.

107
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:04,350
It is still the time where Capsicum was not understood by me and he was flabby

108
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:09,020
and he had that redness in the face and all that and of course I gave him Calc carbonica.

109
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,770
And then nothing has happened and I was searching and searching to find out.

110
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:25,020
I was talking a little bit more to him to find out that he was ready to go back to Cyprus,

111
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,930
the place where he was coming, now he was in Athens for the last 15-20 years.

112
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:37,940
He studied in Athens and all that and said, I just want to go back to Cyprus. I said why?

113
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,060
I asked him, there is a nostalgia for...?

114
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,510
He said, yes exactly I can not live anymore here.

115
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,350
He had his wife and children, he wanted to just leave them and go back?

116
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,950
Go back to what? I don't know. What is there?

117
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,460
Nothing but I just want to go back, there is something which overwhelms me

118
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,490
and I can not control it.

119
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,480
You see these are the feelings, the very easily aroused,

120
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:17,450
as far as past is concerned but in the books it says homesickness.

121
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,170
If you open your Repertory you see homesickness and Capsicum is there.

122
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:35,820
But a whole make-up is that easily insulted, you take something and he is insulted,

123
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,860
he will not retaliate.

124
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:46,430
It's not a person that he will make an argument against it but he will be very easily hurt inside.

125
00:16:52,420 --> 00:17:19,500
Half people they can not go on for ever with this intensity of the feelings inside and this idea.

126
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:33,320
This past which can not be attained anymore gives a feeling of paralyzing,

127
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:39,070
the feeling of a person that can not keep on with life, he can not go on with life.

128
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:46,320
I think Kent mentions the suicidal disposition,

129
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,850
I think he says it's overwhelming suicidal disposition.

130
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,570
Actually I would like to have Kent's Materia Medica here.

131
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:06,920
Is anybody that has a spare one to give me? I want to look something.

132
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:25,330
I remember Kent is writing this and I believe she can confirm it, overwhelming (?) of suicide.

133
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:35,320
The way it is put there I think it is not given exactly the right context.

134
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:44,160
You see what they do is I can not leave the feelings of the past, they are so great

135
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:53,160
and the present is so bad, easily insulted. Somebody says something and oh,

136
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,900
he said it for me, he meant me.

137
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,860
He discuss it with his wife who was present in the situation or his friend and he says,

138
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,360
did you hear what he said? He said that for me.

139
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:16,020
No, the friend answers no. He said that because of that reason. No, no he said it for me.

140
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:22,030
And you can not persuade him but he is aware of what is going on,

141
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:30,270
as far as his (?) and especially a feeling of insecurity, which is inside.

142
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:46,630
There is a great insecurity which is mostly towards the financial side.

143
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:55,780
They do not feel insecure financially like the Bryonia, don't confuse that.

144
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:06,300
If you have that as a symptomatology, that is Bryonia.

145
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:19,960
I had a case, it was a skin eruption and I was taking the case and discussing with the man

146
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:30,700
and says no fears, no anxieties, I have some anxiety about financial things all over the world,

147
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:39,700
what is going to happen and all that. You keep on, some anxieties and you don't know what to give.

148
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:49,290
The wife tells you I want to tell you something about him when he is not present.

149
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,700
I said what? I'm interested.

150
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:02,520
She said, my god the financial insecurity that he has is so tremendous

151
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,850
that from the morning till the night, all the time he will speak for nothing else

152
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:11,610
but how we shall be secure.

153
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,710
We buy some (?) here and we have bought some (?) there and we have that security from that side

154
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,200
and that security from that side...

155
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,200
It is terrible, I can not stand it, I can not tolerate it anymore.

156
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:28,950
I don't care about security and I know that we are going to survive after all

157
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:37,030
but this is absolutely what is in his mind constantly. My god it is a terrible thing.

158
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:46,360
And I say that is Bryonia. That tremendous insecurity is Bryonia, fear of poverty,

159
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,940
fear that he will die in spite of what securities that has secured,

160
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,690
he will die as a (?) That is a tremendous feature in Bryonia,

161
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:01,630
which comes in Capsicum in less degree.

162
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:12,280
We talk about degrees and intensities in Homeopathy.

163
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:20,810
When you say anxiety, it doesn't mean a thing, when you say this person has anxiety,

164
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:30,040
it doesn't mean a thing but if you say this person has tremendous anxiety

165
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:36,800
and the anxiety was that she can not just sit in one corner, that kind of anxiety,

166
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:42,030
I don't know, there is a feeling which I don't know.

167
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:49,310
You get a description, it's not now anymore any remedy, it's one remedy and that's Psorinum.

168
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,280
That kind of anxiety is Psorinum, tremendous anxiety.

169
00:22:53,380 --> 00:23:03,800
Tremendous homesickness, I don't want to live anymore, then that's Capsicum.

170
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:10,560
When you get fear of poverty, poverty, poverty all the time, that is Bryonia.

171
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,840
That's not prescribing on keynote, that's prescribing on essence

172
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:22,540
because we have found the weak points where... the chemistry of the body most probably

173
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:32,290
and the enzymes and the synapses produce such a state where they leave open spaces in the brain

174
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:38,330
which are concerned with financial security and they don't feed back.

175
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:46,210
They leave it open, anxiety and ... poverty and then... anxiety as what? I don't know.

176
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,950
So we are talking about degrees and that's why those that have attended my teachings

177
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:58,690
for some years, I've told them that I will change my prescription

178
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:07,210
if on that symptom you get two underlines and I said put three underlines

179
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:14,210
and that intensity of that symptom may change my whole prescription finally.

180
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,610
Just because the symptom is very intense it becomes another remedy.

181
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:28,550
So much intensity, so much sadness, depression, tremendous depression I just want to die.

182
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:37,710
I don't want to live. That is Aurum state.

183
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:48,030
The degree plays a very important part to understand the remedy in its degree

184
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:55,600
and its sensitivity and its peculiarity it is to understand Homeopathy.

185
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:04,840
I'm teaching you level 3 now, level 4 I'm teaching you.

186
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:13,650
Away from what you have learned to go and observe but that does not exist in the Repertory.

187
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:20,330
I mean when I have that I don't care whether in the Repertory is written pain on the right knee.

188
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:28,340
He comes and says pain on the right knee but your remedy is not there, what about that?

189
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,230
Maybe I'm making a mistake.

190
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:42,240
It's not that, it is because I prescribed on this context of things

191
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:48,260
that I disregard the pain on the right knee but sometimes when I don 't have that

192
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,990
and I have the pain on the right knee, I go and prescribe on the pain on the right knee

193
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:59,590
because I don't have this information, which is the essence, which is a deeper thing.

194
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,290
Now the easily insulted and the nostalgia, you understand the sensitivities of the person

195
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:16,910
and all that, it works on a level which is ...

196
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:28,820
Here is the normal level and here operates on that level. More higher in intensity.

197
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:46,000
So the five senses become acute. Eyesight, hearing is more acute.

198
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:57,370
Eyesight is very acute. Taste is very acute. Smell is very acute.

199
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:08,400
And he needs up to a certain time on that level over stimulated.

200
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:23,470
And now in this level is when he says I can not live.

201
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:31,850
The feelings are so strong that he feels he will die from feelings, from intensity of feelings,

202
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,080
he can not keep on going in life.

203
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:52,580
Now this state at the moment drops down to the opposite. This is the normal.

204
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,840
This is higher than normal.

205
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:59,850
Then he goes suddenly... he switches off and goes into a state

206
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:04,830
which is operating now under normal intensity.

207
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:09,420
Now what is the phenomenon on that state now and that can be Capsicum as well?

208
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:18,670
There the nostalgia is completely gone. The past is completely forgotten.

209
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:27,700
So you get a person who lives in the present and he does not remember, really he does

210
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,940
not remember. If you tell him, you don't remember that situation we were together there?

211
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:47,370
He can't remember. He passed as if he took a sponge and erased it.

212
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:59,290
Now what is left there as pathology...

213
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,030
One thing I forgot to tell you for that state, in this state which they are,

214
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:13,520
with the sensitivities, they have no fear or anxieties about their health, fear of dying,

215
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:28,290
fear of getting a disease. None of that area you will find in Capsicum.

216
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:45,360
When they go into that state again you see no anxieties and no fear

217
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:53,020
that are concerning his own health and his own well-being, as far as health is concerned.

218
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,520
No concern about that.

219
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:02,610
But what is left there is a tremendous anxiety and the insecurity he had in the beginning,

220
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:13,370
the material insecurity that he had in the beginning, it has become more now.

221
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:21,860
He is concerned therefore about his future and to secure his future much more than before,

222
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:31,270
when he was in that state, that brings about an indescribable anxiety,

223
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,850
which there is always in the background.

224
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:48,520
He works and he does what capable people do in their job but what they feel in that state

225
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,270
is that the mind that was working quickly...

226
00:30:52,370 --> 00:31:04,550
Actually I would say that these people they talk with their feelings inside.

227
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:14,470
The feelings are so vague that produce thoughts. In that second state, they can't hear.

228
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:23,220
The feelings are subdued to such an extend that the possibility of reflection of a human

229
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:32,140
being stops and the process of reflection goes away completely.

230
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:40,890
So he realizes that he has missed something. He understands that this thing in which he is,

231
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:50,720
is not healthy state at all because events do not touch him anymore.

232
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:58,150
It is a kind of protection, self-protection which the self-mechanism is putting.

233
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:03,140
Before, the reason inside, the sub-conscious reason on such a case is that

234
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,160
before everything was making such a big impression, that stayed for life

235
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:15,000
and created such tremendous feelings inside but there is a point where he could not live anymore

236
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,970
with these feelings. Now what he does?

237
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:29,330
He cuts such of feelings, such of the possibility of receiving impressions from the outside world.

238
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,220
So he does not have feelings.

239
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,330
A great thing happened and he is not overjoyed.

240
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,720
A catastrophe happened, he is not overwhelmed with that. He faces it logically.

241
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:51,250
He says, now there is a catastrophe OK, what should we do next? That state of affairs.

242
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:59,810
But the reflection, the possibility of having these feelings which were creating thoughts...

243
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,050
What I mean by reflection? Do you understand it?

244
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:08,160
Is anybody who does not understand what is a reflection?

245
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,900
I will explain.

246
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:23,810
If you had not be described that case, you would never understand it.

247
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:31,810
You enter in that room or you walk out of that room in the garden

248
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:42,550
or we had been fighting inside here and then you say, too much fighting, you go outside.

249
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:48,030
And as soon as you go outside there is green and peaceful and all that.

250
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:55,190
Now you were inside here with the reflection that my god the world is bad and we,

251
00:33:55,290 --> 00:34:01,140
human beings will never be able...This is reflecting on what is happening, what you see.

252
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:08,130
We'll never go to make it. Now this is the impression of the environment,

253
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:10,700
it gives you these thoughts automatically.

254
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,720
You go out now in this green and this beautiful and all that and you say,

255
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,980
oh my god after all... This is reflection.

256
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:24,050
There is a state of mind which is serene and nice and beautiful.

257
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:29,550
We can all work together, we can all make it, we can find ways...

258
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:34,790
The reflection because of the outside world, the impression that gives you brings

259
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:41,540
about feelings which are not exactly, as I call now, make them into thoughts.

260
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:47,130
They can be just states of being. That is reflection.

261
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:51,380
That is the outside world reflecting inside as the impression

262
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,300
and creating feelings and thoughts. That's a reflection.

263
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:07,050
That process, which is natural to human beings, stops in and does not reflect.

264
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:15,050
Because he was doing much reflection before and that caused him tremendous pain.

265
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:21,290
And he does not want it. He protects himself now. Green is nice!

266
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:29,380
He does not make it consciously. That is sub-conscious processes which go on.

267
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:36,010
He does not know what is going on. Actually he found out that after a series of antibiotics

268
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:43,700
or a shock he switched off to that state.

269
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:57,180
He remained 10 days attending the father and mother who were sick in hospital

270
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,760
and over tired and then the mother did not make it, she had a brain episode

271
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:09,940
and after that there is a switch. No feelings.

272
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:18,090
We say in Capsicum there is no feelings but it is not the state of Phosphoric acid

273
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:23,190
or Carbo vegetabilis where you see that indifference.

274
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:37,330
It is a minimizing of the impressions to the least possible, still the feelings are alive

275
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:43,270
but minimized, not strong feelings anymore.

276
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,680
The anxiety now overtakes and the insecurity is much more in this state.

277
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:58,760
And during that state we see that the sleep is disturbed and then he gets sleeplessness.

278
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:07,010
What kind of sleeplessness? He wakes up at 3 o'clock and he can not sleep anymore.

279
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:12,260
He has anxiety. Now he is very tired during all these days and these people

280
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:22,830
because of wrong assimilation I would say, they get that flabbiness.

281
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:33,080
Together with the flabbiness they get a feeling of being tired very much.

282
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,080
That feeling of tired is with brain also.

283
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:43,470
The brain gets easily tired, the body gets easily tired, the feelings get easily tired.

284
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:50,510
So when he goes to sweep is very tired and he goes to sleep immediately.

285
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:57,170
After 3 and a half hours he wakes up and there is a state of underlined anxiety,

286
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:00,410
which keeps him awake, he can not sleep anymore.

287
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:11,670
Now you may confuse that state with what remedy?

288
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:16,380
-Kali carbonicum.

289
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,910
-It is Kali bichromicum mostly. The flabbiness in the stomach and this tremendous

290
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:30,010
flabbiness, which is similar to Capsicum, is Kali bichromicum mostly.

291
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:42,910
I have been told by a doctor who took Kali bichromicum only, that a few days after taking it,

292
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:49,670
my stomach started become flabby, he said within a few days

293
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,680
he started getting flabby in the stomach very much.

294
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:58,410
So Kali bichromicum has a great characteristic as a general obesity,

295
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,910
it has it in italic but flabbiness around the abdomen and the stomach

296
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:08,930
is one of the main remedies, Kali bichromicum is one of the main remedies.

297
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:23,760
With the sleeplessness, which you get, you may confuse it.

298
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:33,160
The difference is that with Capsicum it is not the hour that counts

299
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:44,440
because if he goes to bed at 9.30, he will wake up at 1 o'clock.

300
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:58,760
After 3 and a half hours he will wake up and then what is going to happen,

301
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:06,610
he is going to stay two hours almost in a waking state and then he goes back to sleep.

302
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:17,260
Where with Kali bichromicum this person rather goes to bed at 1 o'clock in the morning,

303
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,250
he will wake up at 4,30.

304
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:29,510
With Kali bichromicum if you go to bed at 1 o'clock, he will get up at 3,30.

305
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:34,200
After 2 hours he will get up.

306
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:43,090
With Capsicum he takes at least 3 and a half hours, 4 hours of sleep and then he wakes up

307
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:48,090
and then he has the anxiety but because he is very tired he stays in bed and try to sleep

308
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:54,430
and tries for 2 hours, finally he sleeps again; he is so tired, he sleeps for another 3 hours.

309
00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:00,510
And if he has the possibility, he will wake up late in the morning.

310
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:07,610
And then that sleep, if he can manage to take that second part, if he has the possibility

311
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:18,960
and the circumstances but that second sleep really helps him.

312
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,120
Otherwise he will stay with 3 and a half hours only and in a state

313
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:32,190
where he will be pushing himself all the time to do whatever he has to do.

314
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:59,180
In that state his mind, as we said, works slowly now.

315
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,670
He understands that he was a person who was perceiving very much before,

316
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:13,730
he was a perceptible person, very easy to understand something and now his mind is lazy.

317
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:19,550
It doesn't want to do anything unless he pushes it. His body is lazy also.

318
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:28,050
So he will have to push himself and since it's a person who is quite like Kalis,

319
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:35,870
that means his sense of duty is quite a lot there, he is pushing himself to do it.

320
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:52,640
But he will try to do whatever is necessary, absolutely necessary to keep on going.

321
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:00,380
The minimum possible. I'll give you an example.

322
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:18,390
He has his desk, he is a lawyer and he pulls out a case to study,

323
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:22,380
he studies the case of his clients and all that.

324
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:29,870
He puts all his effort and he concentrates finally on studying the case.

325
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:35,620
When the time comes where he has to take that back and put it in the file,

326
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,970
he doesn't have enough energy to do it. What he does, he leaves it there.

327
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:49,200
He pulls another file because to study, he will have to go and get it. He leaves it there.

328
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:55,370
3,4,5 cases are left there and then the books and he pulls out a book to study

329
00:43:55,470 --> 00:44:01,040
because of such and such and he wants to look and the book is not there and finally...

330
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:13,390
he makes the effort to take all this and put back everything.

331
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:23,290
But he does not have the energy, you give him Capsicum and he will say, I'm ordered now,

332
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:27,790
I know what to do, I put it back, I take these notes and I put them in the right place.

333
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:31,660
Now he takes notes...

334
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,540
Sometimes I have sometime to classify and put it in the right envelop.

335
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:42,450
So he does the minimum of what is required from him.

336
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:53,100
A lawyer wants to present a case to the High Court and then he would postpone it

337
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,100
and postpone it until the last few days where he has to do it.

338
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:03,350
Then he takes it and pushes himself and tries to do it and he does it.

339
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:09,440
That is a laziness that is not a laziness.

340
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,530
I mean, you understand what it is.

341
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:21,780
It is lack of energy, assimilation is wrong and that's why now these people

342
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:26,020
what do they need in order to keep on going?

343
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,790
They need assimilation.

344
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:38,270
That's why there is a desire for alcoholic drinks, there is a desire for coffee

345
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:55,620
but there is a desire also, strange enough, for things which have very spicy taste and pepper.

346
00:45:56,870 --> 00:46:05,030
Lots of pepper. They will put a lot of pepper, it seems that the organism needs that

347
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:12,150
to stimulate itself and you can have the Capsicum in desire pepper.

348
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:30,300
Red pepper and black pepper, anything that will be strong, hot, spicy.

349
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:48,520
Mostly pepper. Inordinate desire for pepper.

350
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:58,690
Kent was giving Lac caninum for that...

351
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:11,940
Desire and aversion, some will tell you.

352
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:32,180
This idea now, you understand that is (?) in every level and what is peculiar in that,

353
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:40,040
when a person is on that level is that they may have dreams.

354
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:48,920
During the dreams they live in a state of nostalgia that they used to live in the past

355
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:56,180
in the waking state. In it they have dreams of great nostalgia.

356
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,180
While they are in a place, they imagine that they are in Washington and a love affair

357
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,430
and the young years and what was happening there and there is a dream

358
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:13,430
which almost is frightening from intensity of feelings.

359
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,590
They will have the feelings that are waking up from a sleep.

360
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:32,120
I mean really that is if they are in that state. It is as if they are half asleep.

361
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:41,470
Like a person who operates with half of his brain. They are half asleep.

362
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:56,690
In that state also the sensitivity from being insulted, from being criticized is there.

363
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:05,440
What is lost in that state is that nostalgia feelings, this homesickness,

364
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:10,420
this over sensitivity towards that.

365
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:18,430
And then it is lost also the acuteness that was going together with that state.

366
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:29,180
The anxiety has stayed, the depression has stayed and the idea that life is not worth

367
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:42,530
living. After all he does not enjoy, again in that state. It is not a nice state.

368
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:49,340
And finally why do I work for?

369
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:59,600
I don't enjoy anything. And some thoughts of let me die, why not?

370
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:13,200
There is no fear at all about dying, about having a serious disease.

371
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:31,490
The Aurum depression that I was telling is much stronger, much stronger...

372
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:37,640
These people they will communicate with you, they will talk, they will seem to enjoy

373
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:43,050
quite a lot, it is not a deep enjoyment, a deep feeling that they have lost,

374
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:48,150
with a state of dissatisfaction from life.

375
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:59,650
Aurum can not. They can not enjoy anything. When that Aurum state comes, that's the end.

376
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:21,380
There is no anxiety on financial, material things.

377
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:33,630
That comes together with the feeling that people are insulting him, people are criticizing him,

378
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:36,950
so he can not rely on others.

379
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:44,290
You see the natural feeling of companionship is lost. They can not rely on somebody.

380
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:54,880
The husband or the mother or the sister or the parents, that is lost and they feel

381
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:06,980
that others are inimical, are against them to a much greater degree than reality.

382
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:13,730
They imagine that others are insulting them much more than they really do.

383
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:30,210
No, he doesn't go so far, it is the first hints of paranoia.

384
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:34,360
-Do they avoid people?

385
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:44,130
-No, they don't become antisocial but if you insult them, they will become psyche

386
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:51,210
and they will not talk to you. But they will talk with everybody else.

387
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:58,640
After a few days they will come back and they will talk to you also.

388
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:07,890
But they will get the feeling that you have criticized them. That has hurt them.

389
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:27,130
Not for long time, as long as the hurt is lasting. It is not like Nitric acid that can not forget.

390
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:56,950
Now coming down to local symptoms, Capsicum is very frequently indicated in mastoiditis

391
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:06,800
where there is inflammation of the mastoid processes and there are burning pains, very severe.

392
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:21,690
Capsicum is pepper. The idea of pepper and the sensation that causes must not leave your mind

393
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:28,770
and the pains of Capsicum are of a burning type.

394
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:41,670
You have a severe cold and there is redness on the soft palate and on the (?) there is

395
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:47,020
tremendous redness and tremendous burning.

396
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:57,430
All these details you can not go about and prescribe because there is inflammation

397
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:01,340
and redness and burning you will not prescribe Capsicum.

398
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,510
And that is the problem and that's why I'm not talking about details of that sort.

399
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,750
Because they will be useless.

400
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:19,500
What you have to keep in mind and you may use it is the whole, what I describe as the whole,

401
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:31,520
and the details will just confirm what you have been thinking about with a remedy.

402
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:38,250
There is another keynote symptom that Capsicum will get sometimes

403
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:48,830
that during cough only there is a tremendous offensiveness of the breath, as he is coughing,

404
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:55,480
which can be understood by the same person. By the person himself.

405
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:07,200
I think we have fear of being censored, it's written in the Repertory.

406
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:18,180
Just look in the Repertory.
-Yes.

407
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,670
-Is it by itself Capsicum?
-Yes.

408
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:30,690
-You see how strong it is? Censored, this is a word we don't use anymore, critical.

409
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:33,600
Fear of being criticized.

410
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:08,690
From what I have given you, I had information, hints from the Materia Medica,

411
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:13,200
from the Repertory to go and prescribe and have the feedback

412
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:19,200
and observe what has been done and then the picture has developed eventually.

413
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:26,980
It's not that I had some ideas on my own that some kind of enlightenment that this is Capsicum.

414
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:33,700
I observed and what I observed, I put it together and then I used it in another case

415
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:39,450
and I saw it worked and that is how I have developed what we call the "essences".

416
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:43,690
In the beginning I never thought that that's a big deal.

417
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:48,540
It was later that the people told me they are helpful.

418
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:54,800
In the beginning when I was teaching in the School in Athens I was giving Materia Medica

419
00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:06,280
like that and I said, you go and study the case now and then one told me, no you must tell us;

420
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:14,030
it's much more easy to understand the remedy after we heard you talking

421
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:17,030
and put things together and then we go and we study the remedy.

422
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:23,610
Then it's much more easy for us to comprehend it. And that's why I give you this

423
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:28,480
and I hope it's helping someone.

424
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:41,200
You remember that it is sensitive to hearing.

425
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:53,690
That sensitiveness in hearing it becomes very acute if he is having chills, if he is feeling cold.

426
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:58,940
The feeling of cold is there I stressed that, that he is worse cold, in the beginning.

427
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:08,050
Now during that state where he is feeling cold the sensitiveness to noise is accentuated.

428
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:33,690
There is also a large sensation in the head and pain in the head during coughing

429
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:37,040
but this is also with many other remedies.

430
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:49,700
I just give you an example, what a Materia Medica could give as information.

431
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:59,020
It says, for instance, ulcers in the mouth, ulcers burning. (?) small, ulcers in the gums,

432
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,780
inflammation of the gums.

433
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:12,700
All this information is useless, if you take it by itself because all remedies have that

434
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:18,510
and it's very difficult to go by that local symptomatology.

435
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:27,050
And that's why we need information to differentiate between one remedy and the other.

436
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:45,120
Thirst before chill is characteristic, also another keynote is great thirst after stool.

437
01:00:52,890 --> 01:01:05,530
It has diarrheas, all kind of enteritis, also constipation and it has hemorrhoids,

438
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:14,290
it has all kind of pathology which will not be very helpful to find Capsicum,

439
01:01:14,390 --> 01:01:21,210
if you just rely on that local symptomatology.

440
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:37,370
Pain in bladder during cough also? Not very often because I think it's not so much indicated,

441
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:40,280
as we miss it many times.

442
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:49,520
It's one of the remedies that we miss quite a lot at least in the cases which I have seen.

443
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:53,940
They have this obesity here especially, don't forget that.

444
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:58,770
It's a tremendous feeling of a sac.

445
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:09,530
They eat a little bit and it bloats up and they feel as if they have eaten 2 kilos.

446
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:19,280
They have eaten only 250 gram of food and they feel as if they have eaten a kilo.

447
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:27,190
It's not a heavy thing, it's the general sensation. They drink a glass of water

448
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:31,040
and it bloats up in particular place.

449
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:44,350
Worse from exertion in the beginning, when they try themselves to put it into action.

450
01:02:44,450 --> 01:02:50,250
But eventually they manage to put the body into some action.

451
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,480
-It's not like the Calcarea at all?

452
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:56,900
-Yes, there are differences but you can confuse it.

453
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
-Do they tend to be more intellectual or more (?) ?

454
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,500
-I think. I would not call them intellectual.

455
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:23,000
Sports and events? I can not say this.

456
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:33,320
-I can see how it's different in (?)

457
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:38,070
-They will not express it. That state, the second state,

458
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:43,900
down state will not be expressed in any way like Phosphoric acid.

459
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:53,900
Phosphoric acid will sit there and you will see that nothing touches him.

460
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:05,500
You talk to him and it does not matter. With Capsicum you have a live person in front of you.

461
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:14,560
He will laugh, he will talk to you like that, he will make jokes, he will interact with you.

462
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:25,730
Anything is according to what he understands his health and how he should be.

463
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:31,480
It's now functioning much less. He will tell you.

464
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:36,570
He will tell you that I have slowed down my mind and my emotions are not as vigorous

465
01:04:36,670 --> 01:04:42,560
and alive as they used to be and they will describe it in the way I do it now.

466
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:45,170
Not the Phosphoric acid.

467
01:04:46,670 --> 01:05:04,590
Sometimes you get the Phosphoric acid saying, I want to...I'm describing now Phos acid.

468
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:25,010
I went to... to high park. It takes all this time to remember high park, you see?

469
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:41,360
And I had a friend of mine who went to buy... ice-cream.

470
01:05:43,610 --> 01:05:51,000
This, speaks slowly, thinks a lot, forget words... I mean I exaggerated a bit

471
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:56,840
but I have seen this is like that exactly, the way I described it to you.

472
01:05:56,940 --> 01:06:04,090
So it's a different understanding. If I go inside and I see a case, I will not say, forget it.

473
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:08,310
Phosphoric acid is not Phos acid but if I see that I will say yes Phos acid.

474
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:12,590
You may think about that or Carbo vegetabilis.

475
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:20,090
-(?)

476
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:28,080
-Very good observation. Yes the mentality is quite different.

477
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:36,840
The Calcarea phosphorica is a dissatisfied person mostly.

478
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:49,840
It's complaining and complaining, moaning, sighing.

479
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:54,060
It's a different context all together with the Calcarea.

480
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:59,000
The sensitivity to cold is there, the  flabbiness is there.

481
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:05,510
Flabbiness in the stomach also is with Calcarea phosphorica and lowering of the mind

482
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:08,100
and not much reflection.

483
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:15,100
When I say there is no reflection I'll give you another example, to give you the degrees

484
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,960
and the intensity.

485
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:26,670
When I say no reflection in Capsicum, I do not mean a lack of reflection

486
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:36,510
that there is in Helleborus, which is much stronger. There it's really flat.

487
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:43,690
There is no mind there, nothing.

488
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:53,580
So in degrees and in (?) we have to be very careful and that's why we need the keynotes

489
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,330
to confirm what we see.

490
01:07:56,430 --> 01:08:02,090
Ah, we see that is a keynote, we see it's worse during melting snow.

491
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:10,420
Ah, it's Calcarea phosphorica now what I see.

492
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:16,500
You see I confirm what I observe and I vacillate between Calcarea carbonica

493
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:22,920
and Calcarea phosphorica and Ferrum metallicum and Capsicum, which I have in my mind.

494
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,440
Then he gives me that keynote.

495
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:27,020
My mind goes straight there.

496
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:37,680
It's some confirmatory symptomatology always that will give you the differences most of the time.

497
01:08:51,680 --> 01:09:02,550
... the second state can come about as another layer on a case.

498
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:07,300
It does not have to be in a person that you see in the that state,

499
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:15,200
you go back on his past and you will definitely see that state as well.

500
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:23,200
It's not necessary that when you back in his history you will see that state or that state.

501
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:29,540
That state can come about in a Natrum muriaticum case or in a Kali carbonicum case

502
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:34,790
where you see hints of what I talk about in Capsicum.

503
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:40,590
You see it as a top layer on this context.

504
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:48,710
-Isn't that true from (?) that you can see a stage (?)

505
01:09:48,810 --> 01:10:01,060
-Yes, this is the idea that I have and which I have told you in the School.

506
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:31,700
What I have observed with the remedies and with the patients is that different remedies

507
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,800
have different levels of expression.

508
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:52,800
It's not necessary to have all kinds of symptomatology in a person.

509
01:10:57,470 --> 01:11:07,860
For instance, good homeopaths with experience like Pascera actually.

510
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:16,940
Pascera is one of the best homeopaths existing and when he talked in Athens

511
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:23,660
in the International Seminar that was the first one that we had,

512
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:32,660
he said that when you see there are no fears, you can forget about Calcarea.

513
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,660
Calcarea is full of fears, all kinds of fears.

514
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:42,410
Now this is not my experience and I treated cases where you try to find a fear

515
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:45,500
in a Calcarea carbonica and it doesn't exist.

516
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:55,000
This level is completely untouched and natural and healthy, it has not been affected.

517
01:11:55,100 --> 01:11:57,500
The mental-emotional level is not affected.

518
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,000
And you have only physical symptomatology.

519
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:05,670
So that's a stage of development of Calcarea carbonica.

520
01:12:05,770 --> 01:12:10,500
The same with other remedies and they can go into different pathology.

521
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:17,740
In stages in pathology, mental-emotional pathology first stage, is anxiety

522
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:25,500
and this and that and second stage is delusions and hearing voices

523
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,110
and this and that and fourth stage is breaking up everything.

524
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:38,500
You know the Staphysagria? I mentioned a Staphysagria case the first day, I think.

525
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:47,080
A schizophrenia case, where she started throwing things...

526
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:51,180
OK, now when we talk about Staphysagria on a level

527
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:58,920
where Staphysagria is very much affected and suppressed and all that,

528
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:02,410
you will not see that aggressivity.

529
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:12,160
It will have to go to another stage of Staphysagria where the logic is cut off

530
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:18,170
and then the sub-conscious is throwing things.

531
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:23,170
This is the sub-conscious what it wanted to do all the time and it was not doing it.

532
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:28,670
That is another level in the development of the remedy

533
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:34,850
and in the development of the patient's pathology.

534
01:13:36,850 --> 01:13:44,270
So they do have stages and we have to have in mind in studying the case

535
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:49,260
and seeing the patient in conjunction with the remedy,

536
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:53,760
that he maybe in that stage of the remedy.

537
01:13:53,860 --> 01:14:03,370
The Veratrum album is a remedy which is indicated mostly in mental cases.

538
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:09,090
But I have given it to a pneumonia case and acted beautifully

539
01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:17,850
without any symptomatology of the mental-emotional and these are examples

540
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:22,100
that many times you will see in your experience.

541
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:27,350
Therefore I have advanced the theory that there are stages in development of pathology

542
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:34,180
of each remedy, like there are stages in development of pathology within the person.

543
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:39,430
He goes from that state of pathology to another state of pathology, still the same remedy.

544
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:45,680
But another stage, another picture. So do not mix the stages

545
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:53,930
and do not expect to have stage two symptomatology in stage one necessarily.

546
01:14:54,030 --> 01:15:00,180
Some hints of stage two might be in stage one but not necessarily.

547
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:06,750
You say, where is that? Not necessarily.

548
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:21,160
Where you see what I read you on Phosphorus hypochondriacal case. You remember?

549
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:26,330
I read you a hypochondriacal case where he ...what about my fiancé,

550
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:28,720
should I get married now?

551
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:37,160
That stage of pathology of Phosphorus is different from the other stage

552
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:42,910
where we get the clear cut  fears, fear of the dark, fear of being alone,

553
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:47,420
he always wants company, he says fear of thunderstorms.

554
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:52,910
This is a level of mental-emotional pathology for Phosphorus

555
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:56,660
that if you overstep the marks you don't see anymore the fear of the dark.

556
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:02,500
You don't see anymore the fear of thunderstorms, yet it is Phosphorus.

557
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:09,410
Not necessarily you have to have fear of thunderstorms to give Phosphorus.

558
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:15,120
You see the person I read to you the whole thing, it has no fear of thunderstorms.

559
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:16,810
And yet it was Phosphorus.

560
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:24,070
So that pathology it is better, the fear of thunderstorm, fear of the dark,

561
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:29,820
not so much annoying as that state where his mind is defused in different things

562
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,170
and concerns in different other matters.

563
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:39,820
When you are treating a case like that and you give Phosphorus,

564
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:48,070
you may see coming back to stage one where he has fear of dark, fear of thunderstorms

565
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:51,060
and characteristics of that level.

566
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:59,920
That means he is progressing, he is doing better, don't touch him.

567
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:19,170
There are a lot of subjects which are still not clarified. I hope this is clarifying matters.

568
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:35,560
-(?) how often would you prescribe it without the physical symptoms?

569
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:44,210
-The cases I can remember now, I can bring in my mind they were all the obese type.

570
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:53,150
Maybe there is Capsicum state where there is no the obesity, especially in the first stage

571
01:17:53,250 --> 01:18:01,900
I believe, in that stage where there is this coming of these feelings, maybe.

572
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:15,650
But I have not seen it. We must say 80% (?)

573
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:18,520
-Capsicum children?

574
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:22,650
-I'm not experienced with that.

575
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:34,650
What is also interesting is that everyone of us since we are taking these lines can work

576
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:44,570
and can bring information concerning these remedies, which are very badly

577
01:18:44,670 --> 01:18:55,340
and inadequately described so far.

578
01:18:57,330 --> 01:19:02,980
You can work and if you have a case give it to the Journals,

579
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:11,340
to collect that information slowly and complete it.

580
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:20,990
It's a lot of work that has to be done in Homeopathy in research. A lot.

581
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:27,190
And nobody can do it unless he is one remedy prescribed, he's a classical prescriber.

582
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:31,400
The others are lost completely. You gave three remedies, forget it.

583
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:39,900
What feedback can you get from that? The patient got better. Yes but so what?

584
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:47,270
As far as research is concerned, you don't advance the science at all.

585
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:20,070
In that second state whether there is still the sensitiveness to criticism

586
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:25,070
and the fear that will be criticized, yes in this state it remains

587
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:31,070
and it is almost accentuated, it's more even.

588
01:20:31,170 --> 01:20:35,400
Fear of being criticized it is more, it stays there.
