1
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,639
What is the essence, what is the essential?

2
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:45,089
We say anemia OK but a lot of remedies have anemia. It's not only Ferr. that we give it in cases of anemia.

3
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:56,439
What is characteristic of Ferr. in anemia or in Ferr. cases?

4
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,589
-That they look like in spite of the anemia.

5
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:21,079
-No. Let me say it myself, it's better because we don't have time and people are tired and you want to go for an interval.

6
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:36,999
You will recognize a case of anemia when the patient will tell you that he has a kind of restlessness

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:49,180
which does not make him happy to lie down.
He is not feeling good lying down.

8
00:01:49,950 --> 00:02:01,759
 He needs the restlessness, he needs the movement and he needs especially to walk slowly.

9
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:14,609
People that get anxious in bed and they have to get up and by walking in the room slowly, then their energy

10
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,999
comes back and their ailments become less.

11
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,680
Why is that?

12
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:38,119
Because they need to stimulate the
 circulation to get more blood to the brain.

13
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,289
I will tell you something which
 is characteristic for this remedy.

14
00:02:45,290 --> 00:03:01,079
They need to stretch all the time. It is a
kind of a pump, pumping blood to the head.

15
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:19,479
These movements give more blood and they feel more at ease. It is a remedy which is also very irritable.

16
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,459
Because they don't have enough energy, they get very easily irritated, they cannot contradict, they cannot fight

17
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:33,309
they cannot go into such situation that they need stamina.

18
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:48,959
And they are aggravated a lot by noise and by the slightest noise like another remedy, Asar. and another one, Ther.

19
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:58,269
So these are the 3 remedies primarily that with the slight noise they are aggravated.

20
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:18,379
They are people who feel tired and yet there is a redness but a redness which if you look at this redness is not healthy.

21
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:25,479
It is something that reminds you that the person is rather sick.

22
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:38,999
 It is a redness which is not real red,
a little bit red and then the rest is white, pale.

23
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:48,209
Can you imagine, paleness with a little bit of rose, not red.

24
00:04:50,700 --> 00:05:05,599
You will see also from people who are using Ferr. in doses because they are anemic, a lot of iron, they cannot tolerate

25
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,389
and immediately they vomit or they have diarrhea.

26
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:22,839
So Ferr. patients they cannot tolerate the food and they will easily vomit, very soon, after eating.

27
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,679
The food goes down and then it comes up, out again.

28
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:40,690
Of course in such weakness they are, we see a disturbance of the circulation with irregularities in the heart function.

29
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:55,449
Vertigo is one of the main themes, especially vertigo which will come from a disturbance of a circulation.

30
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:02,759
They bend down and they try to get up and there is vertigo.

31
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,550
They rise from the bed, there is vertigo.

32
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:21,159
It's a characteristic a headache which will come periodically, every 3 weeks, every 4 weeks

33
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,919
 but will last for 2 or 3 days constantly.

34
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:36,769
And during this time, they cannot touch food or drink. During the headache for 2-3 days they cannot.

35
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,079
Because if they do, immediately they will vomit.

36
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:52,009
So constant headache that comes periodically for 2-3 days, the first remedy we're thinking is Ferr.

37
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:05,679
Desire for tomatoes is strong and aversion to eggs also is strong and it is characteristic.

38
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:10,159
Who has aversion to tomato?

39
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,759
I do not remember if I told you so therefore I cannot ask.

40
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,399
 Aversion to tomato, very seldom, who has aversion to tomato?

41
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,250
Aversion to tomato, raw tomato?

42
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,640
I don't say the remedy.

43
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:04,240
 I have seen strong aversion to tomato, they cannot touch in Hyos.

44
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,489
Who has aversion to eggs?

45
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:36,429
-Phos.
-Now is Phos.  Sulph. also. Ferr. and one more remedy?

46
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:50,110
Caust. no. Caust. has desire for eggs, soft boiled eggs.

47
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:59,799
Colch. yes, the smell of fish especially.

48
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:09,319
Aversion is also to Nit-ac. Nit-ac. many times will have aversion eggs, Phos. will have aversion eggs, Sulph.

49
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,069
will have aversion eggs. Ferr. will have aversion eggs.

50
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:26,249
These are little things, you go to the Repertory and immediately you see it. You don't have to remember by heart.

51
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,449
If you remember it, just your mind goes quickly to these remedies.

52
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,409
You found it? Aversion eggs.

53
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:57,700
-It says aversion to tomato and aversion eggs.
-But that's the polarity, you have said that one remedy can have the opposite.

54
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,599
-No, Phos. has aversion eggs, not tomatoes.

55
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,000
The addition is with your number.

56
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:35,199
Maybe. I just talked the last day about these additions. I saw something unbelievable. I saw in this Synthesis

57
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:47,139
I saw that I'm supposed that I have done a proving on Scorpion, or something like Scorpion, different

58
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:54,359
 than Jeremy did and I have put
symptoms of Scorpion in the Repertory.

59
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:05,419
I said, when did I do it? In my previous life? I've never done it. So I'm trying to find who is the source

60
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:14,039
of this misinformation. There is some misinformation going on. I have criticized the way that provings

61
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:23,129
are done today then most probably somebody with a twisted mind thought OK we'll put this

62
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:30,109
as George has done a proving also and gave symptoms of Scorpio.

63
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:46,579
There is another possibility that maybe I read a case or I had a case who had aversion to tomato in the Phos.

64
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:58,879
which I don't remember. Maybe one case
 like this and then they took it from there.

65
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:15,759
What I know is Hyos. I have seen it repeatedly and I can confirm it. Desire for tomatoes for Ferr. it has to be

66
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:25,600
 really only tomatoes. You eat only
tomatoes. You eat in morning, in breakfast etc.

67
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:33,240
Who likes tomatoes? Everybody.

68
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:41,959
So it's not a simple desire for tomatoes.
It has to be really...tomato!.

69
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:50,319
You say, OK I have a salad of tomato,
I can eat it. Not like that.

70
00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:13,780
The main thing is worse lying down, better sitting, better motion, better stretching. It's like pumping blood into the body.

71
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:20,570
That is a case of Ferr.

72
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:36,839
 It affects the joints, the shoulder joints but especially Ferr-m. affects the right joint.

73
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:59,209
Ferr-m., I have confirmed it, it has cured cases of peri-arthritis or arthritis of the right shoulder.

74
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:32,319
The false plethora, they call it. You see he has some redness, that is not.

75
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:58,559
Merc-c. will be replacing Merc.  under what circumstances?

76
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:08,039
It will be similar as Merc.  but there is a difference. What is the difference?

77
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,310
-Burning?

78
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,439
-Not burning.

79
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:41,969
There is an intensity on the symptoms which is more greater than the Merc. Intensity, the symptoms are very intense.

80
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:49,799
They are much more dangerous they appear much more dangerous than the Solubilis.

81
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:59,919
You will get this constant urging for stool and the stool will be with blood.

82
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:07,239
That means you have ulcerative colitis
of the worst type, with urging all the time.

83
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:19,999
20-25 stools the day, burning yes, acrid discharges but blood also. It's like burning the mucus membranes.

84
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:29,959
Like the mucus membranes being burnt out very fast and the ulcers they will spread.

85
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:35,239
The colitis goes very fast and it's aggressive.

86
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:52,280
Merc. is a colitis remedy but much
more benign.

87
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:07,659
This remedy is aggressive.

88
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:13,159
Which is another remedy we have been
talking about that aggressiveness?

89
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:22,169
You will see that aggressiveness, that burning also there and this spreading out quickly?

90
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:46,359
Canth. also will give you this
impression as Merc-c. It's very exploding.

91
00:17:51,480 --> 00:18:02,639
The nervous system becomes very active. That is why there is a tenesmus, the bladder is constantly

92
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:14,589
needing to urinate but only a few drops. And the stool, you have constant desire for stool and there is

93
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:19,999
a little bit of stool and a little bit of blood
and then the burning and the pains, and then again

94
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:30,399
immediately, they cannot leave the toilet. The one crisis comes after another.

95
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:40,379
Which is another remedy that has
this frequent tenesmus for stool?

96
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:52,839
Nux-v. It also has this tremendous tenesmus
 but not as aggressive as Merc-c.

97
00:18:52,840 --> 00:19:05,879
Merc-c. you see the blood, you see the pain, you see the burning. In Nux-v. it is an irritable colon but not so much.

98
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:20,399
When you see the blood, when you see the mucus membranes, the mucus in the stool, then you have a case of Merc-c.

99
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:25,200
Another action of this drug is on mucus membranes.

100
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,289
 I have seen one of the worst cases of conjunctivitis.

101
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:40,239
 Conjunctivitis which really can make you almost blind.

102
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:51,639
 It is so painful, so breaking out that only constant cortisone can keep it in bay.

103
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,520
It says acrid lacrimation.

104
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:23,249
But here the lids are not the main problem. The main problem is the conjunctiva where Arg-met.

105
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:35,110
mostly the problem is with the inflammation of the lids. Meibomian glands are infected.

106
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:55,499
And then you get Arg-n. which has this severe conjunctivitis, severe redness on a spot.

107
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,720
You see the eye here.

108
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:17,969
 This is Arg-n.
You get redness like raw meat.

109
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:41,459
And if it is quite like this, it goes towards Med.
 If all this is inflamed, then it goes Merc-c.

110
00:21:41,460 --> 00:22:00,809
You see the difference is that Arg-n. is like this. It's very obvious. This redness is very obvious and limited.

111
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,390
The other is much more defused.

112
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:19,769
 This remedy also we will have excessive salivation, you will get the aphthae which are burning

113
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:28,319
 and you will get
excessive salivation, especially the night.

114
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:39,009
With Merc., the salivation is mostly in the night while they are sleeping. With this the salivation is day and night.

115
00:22:39,010 --> 00:23:05,999
Also in this Merc-c. you will have, it is not written here, similar impulsiveness to do some damage, to do something violent.

116
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:18,440
The organism is pushed to react in a violent way.

117
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:28,279
 There is the idea of violence in the organism, the nervous system the way that they perform, the way they speak

118
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:38,149
 the way they do business. There is some kind of violent in the system, in the nervous system.

119
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:45,279
 It can also be affecting the digestive system then the violence goes there.

120
00:23:49,710 --> 00:24:02,279
It's also interesting that once the violence goes all in the digestive system, then the mental or emotional violence reduces.

121
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:15,199
The effect also in the mucus membranes of the mouth, the gums. The gums get inflamed with aphthae, as I said

122
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:29,359
with inflammation, with bleeding and with pains which are burning because of the acidity of the discharges.

123
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:42,129
Therefore this is the remedy par excellence for ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, once the disease is really aggressive.

124
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:53,439
If you give it to an ulcerative colitis which does not have severe burning pains, which does not have this intense

125
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,119
tenesmus it will not have an effect.

126
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:03,890
The nature of the remedy should be there before it has an effect.
