1
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:51,179
Sul-ac. is a remedy when you will see a case where the main complain is exhaustion and at the same time

2
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,849
a feeling of hurriedness inside.

3
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,840
They have to do things very fast.

4
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:19,209
There is not enough time for anything and at the same time exhaustion. And at the same time they cannot finish anything.

5
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:28,619
And at the same time they get irritable and excited because they cannot do enough.

6
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:54,439
It's a remedy that you will need in cases of asthma, when the asthma is always worse in city pollution.

7
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:05,530
With the pollution of the city, they get much worse. They say, 'it's terrible, it kills me to go to the city'

8
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:12,359
 then most probably that is a case of Sul-ac.

9
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:23,769
I want to give you an idea of Sul-ac. hurriedness. We have this hurriedness in other medicines like...

10
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:36,030
Tarent.  it's the main remedy for hurriedness. In Tarent. very seldom you will see tired and hurried.

11
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:46,239
 You will see a lot of energy and a lot of activity and very busy all the time.

12
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:55,849
Doing things all the time, performing 7 tasks at the same time, a lot of energy, so you cannot confuse them.

13
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:08,250
When you see these remedies in the Repertory, they look the same but actually in effect there is no comparison.

14
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,239
There is no way of confusing these two remedies.

15
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:23,290
... one who feels exhausted and tired and still
 the hurriedness feeling will not leave them.

16
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:34,040
I had once a case when he told me
'I'll just give you an example' he says.

17
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:39,988
 'I will give you an example how hurried I am. I go to the toilet'... and you flush after you have urinated or stool.

18
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,239
 He says, 'I pull it first and the I urinate'.

19
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:10,439
This is characteristic, the hurriedness is such he has to perform, he has to do, he has to finish but does not have the time...

20
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:20,710
I remember another case where he has come to my office and he was so much in a hurry, perspiring

21
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:28,689
and he sat down, he gave me a few of his symptoms, very much in a hurry and before I was able to say anything

22
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,599
he picked up his suitcase
 and he wanted to leave.

23
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:42,560
Wait a moment, the consultation is not over, I didn't tell you anything, I didn't ask you any question.

24
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:54,139
These are extreme examples but they show
 the hurriedness, there is no time to lose.

25
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:13,639
Then there is this very characteristic sensation, as if the brain was loose, as if there is a place within the head

26
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:20,089
 where it is empty. So if they do like this,
 they feel the brain goes towards this side.

27
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:30,409
They go like this the brain goes on the other side. They feel the brain is moving in the same way, as the head moves.

28
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:46,879
Like Sulph., they are people who would like stimulants to be able to perform, like alcohol, like sweets.

29
00:05:51,980 --> 00:06:06,679
If you compare the hurriedness in the Repertory, you will see Med. is very much in a hurry, Natr-m. is very much in a hurry,

30
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:19,479
Caust. is very much in a hurry but there are no other remedies which are so much in a hurry as Tarent. and Sul-ac.

31
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:38,400
Sul-ac. also in the way they eat, it is very fast. They gulp their food. They feel others also should do quickly

32
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:51,839
 like Tarent. but if this is strong the person says,
'I like others to do quickly, otherwise I will hit them'.

33
00:06:51,840 --> 00:07:05,759
This is not Sul-ac., this is Tarent. But if they say, 'I like people to do fast their work', it's a matter of intensity

34
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,499
in order to differentiate between Sul-ac. and Tarent.

35
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:17,359
They don't like water but if they
add some brandy, then it's OK.

36
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,620
Excessive perspiration.

37
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:41,530
You will get the feeling sometimes they are like Tub. because there is an excitable element in Sul-ac.

38
00:07:42,250 --> 00:08:00,656
And the perspiration is very strong. And there is a kind of sourish perspiration like Rheum, like Hep., like Calc.

39
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:16,449
Sul-ac. is a remedy that you will
need in digestive problems.

40
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:29,610
Mostly, primarily is the respiratory and then
the second in intensity is the digestive tract.

41
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:37,400
The digestive tract can be affected and
you have gastritis, you have colitis...

42
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:48,750
...but without the feeling of hurriedness which is the main component of the mental-emotional structure of this remedy

43
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,240
...forget Sul-ac.

44
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:30,199
Another thing which you may find in the
digestive tract, is ulcers on the mouth, aphae.

45
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:39,759
The whole gastro-intestinal tract painful often, ecchymosis also is very characteristic.

46
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:53,490
Diarrhea which is like the Sulph. diarrhea
 and you know the Sul-ac. smell.

47
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:34,160
Smells like the septic tank.

48
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,960
Spoiled eggs also.

49
00:10:48,680 --> 00:11:01,439
Eructations which smell like spoiled eggs, diarrhea which smell like Sul-ac. Sul-ac. is characteristic.

50
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,450
These are the characteristics of Sul-ac.

51
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,432
-Could you say something about
 the difference with Arg-n.?

52
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:38,480
-No, you cannot confuse these two remedies.

53
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:58,189
Arg-n. is not in a hurry in that way at all, it's a remedy which is very vital, a lot of energy, extroverts.

54
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:12,419
These people they are not extroverts, they are concentrated upon their particular anxiety.

55
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,520
'I have to do, I have to do quickly things!'.

56
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:36,679
This is the main anxiety which is revolving around in this remedy, there is no the idea of Arg-n. which is

57
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:51,459
if they do have anxiety, it's an anxiety concerning their health primarily. These people do not develop fears.

58
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:59,859
If you get a fear with Sul-ac., that fear most probably will belong to the next remedy.

59
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:06,799
Arg-n. is full of fears.

60
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:29,430
We see some characteristic like the perspiration, which is smelly and the diarrhea which is similar to Sulph.

61
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:37,199
and we see the desire for sweets and alcohol which we see in Sulph.

62
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:55,480
Sulph. also is very much in a hurry, the anxiety is there but when you compare the anxiety of Sulph.

63
00:13:55,481 --> 00:14:05,799
you will see that it revolves around his health more and the Sul-ac., no. The Sul-ac. he will come to you

64
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,760
 he will need a consultation but, as I said, it's not important. What is important to tell you very quickly.

65
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,930
I was amazed, he told me all these in one stretch.

66
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:28,799
And then he was picking up his bag and
 he was collecting his things to go away!

67
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:35,289
This you will not see in other remedies.

68
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,409
If you think about the remedy or if you know the remedy, you will give it. If you don't know...

69
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:54,549
I'm talking about 1968 or 69, back a long time.

70
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,559
Anyhow I gave you the essence.

71
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:14,649
-Question concerning the language. Is the language fast too or do they stumble over their own words?

72
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,670
Are they hasty?

73
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:26,359
 -The way they speak is very hasty but the articulation, as far as I know and I can remember the cases

74
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,970
 they have no problem.
They are not stammering.

75
00:15:47,420 --> 00:16:02,069
In Benz-ac. we have two areas of concentration of the problem. One is the kidneys and the characteristic is

76
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:06,870
 a very heavy smell of urine.

77
00:16:06,871 --> 00:16:13,819
 Kidneys are affected with a
very strong smell of urine.

78
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,800
The other place of action are the joints.

79
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:41,069
Inflammation of the joints which can
end up having problems in the heart.

80
00:16:48,320 --> 00:17:02,720
You get a history of gonorrhea. The gonorrhea is treated and then you get a history of arthritic conditions

81
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:09,400
which change place, from one arthrosis to the other. And eventually it settles in the heart.

82
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:22,199
This whole syndrome should bring to
the mind Benz-ac., except of Med.

83
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:38,260
Heart symptoms alternate with kidney problems.

84
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:48,889
You see the preference of this remedy
between kidneys, joints and the heart.

85
00:17:51,440 --> 00:18:05,080
These remedies are prescribed mostly on this kind of pathology. Heavy urine, very strong color, very smelly

86
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:16,209
and the strange thing is when the problems have gone to the heart, the urine is nice and clear.

87
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:37,399
The aggravations are in the same ranges,
with most of the rheumatic, arthritic remedies.

88
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:48,359
Cold, wet, change of weather makes
 the pains and the joints worse.

89
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:59,559
Trembling in the left side of the lumbar
 region is an interesting symptom.

90
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:17,269
I have heard this one time only but it's very strange symptom and you think of this remedy.

91
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,109
The mental symptoms are something
 like Nat-m. symptoms.

92
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:51,399
These are people who are affected in their kidneys, seem to be holding emotions and not expressing emotions.

93
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:59,889
They are holding emotions concerning
mostly the sexual sphere.

94
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:14,599
They don't express their sexuality and emotionality.

95
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:26,349
Persistent disagreeable thoughts and then eventually when it comes, forgetful of words.

96
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:36,079
In a progress state where you have
 deterioration of the mental level.

97
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,840
Fear of becoming deformed.

98
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:54,679
They don't like to see also people who are deformed, which is like which other remedy?

99
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,540
Which is the remedy they don't
like to see deformed people?

100
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:10,809
Calcareas, they don't like to see
deformed people, they don't like ....

101
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:30,040
Fear that they have been followed
is a symptom of Med.

102
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:39,669
And if there is the gonorrhea and if there
 is this fear, how you will differentiate?

103
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:49,250
The urine. If the urine is heavy
and smelly, yes exactly.

104
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:57,059
Simple things. Keep Homeopathy
 simple and down to earth.

105
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:12,499
Med. has a fear somebody is following, especially in the night. The same thing you will have with Benz-ac.

106
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:31,170
When you have a case of gonorrhea where the person is developing symptoms from his kidneys or from his joints

107
00:22:31,171 --> 00:22:38,559
then you will have a problem to
 differentiate between Med. and Benz-ac.

108
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:49,169
If he tells you that the urine smells heavy, immediately goes towards Benz-ac.

109
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:06,899
Also a very grand characteristic of Med.
 is, in the night feels better.

110
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:16,160
You go to main characteristics of the remedy, when you try to differentiate and then you see which one

111
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:25,890
is clear and which one is strong. Clear and strong, you push the case towards that direction.

112
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,520
How can you remember? You may not remember but you go to the Repertory and you see in the Repertory

113
00:23:37,521 --> 00:23:40,910
 and then you see the differentiation.

114
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:52,359
When you are learning Homeopathy in the beginning, we give you a structure how to take a case.

115
00:23:52,360 --> 00:24:00,109
And we say, you take everything, two hours, three hours, four hours taking of the case.

116
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:12,569
I had one doctor in the center in Athens, she never went down from 3 hours. From 3-4-5 hours to take a case.

117
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:31,919
That's OK but taking all these details it's not going to clear up the case; it's going to make it really more confused.

118
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:38,879
Because can you imagine in 5 hours
how many symptoms a person can relate?

119
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:47,719
You ask a question, 'do you have that?', 'Yes I have that also'. So in the end, you don't know where you are.

120
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:56,409
Then somebody else comes and puts two basic questions, differentiate and says, this is the remedy, proceed.

121
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:09,679
This is what we're aiming at, trying to get what is essential in the patient and what is essential in the remedy.

122
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:21,760
Joints affected, swell, changing places, urine smelly...

123
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:28,449
That is why some people they make
beautiful prescriptions and very quickly.

124
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:41,080
Of course in the beginning you take the case, you take this, you take that, you go to the Repertory and you struggle.

125
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:50,139
But eventually you see more and more. And
what we're doing here is, we come to the basics.

126
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,929
You don't have to remember more than these ones.

127
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:05,359
You remember Benz-ac. has some problems in mental, is hypochondriac, is somebody who has some fears.

128
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:15,209
What fears? I remember something like Med. This is how you work; otherwise you will be lost.

129
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:29,879
Many times even difficult cases, because here all the cases we see are difficult cases, there is no question.

130
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:38,719
And many times when they sit there after 3,4,5 symptoms, I have an idea. I say most probably this is the remedy.

131
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:47,040
Of course I don't stop, I investigate
 because we have to do it properly.

132
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:57,749
But in actual practice, when you are very busy and they telephone every 3 min. there is a telephone call

133
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:07,330
by somebody else and the patients are getting more and more, then you have to have this information

134
00:27:07,331 --> 00:27:11,699
 the basic information.

135
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:21,730
I have done miraculous cures which I don't remember at all. The patient comes and says, 'do you remember me?'

136
00:27:21,731 --> 00:27:31,079
 'No, I don't remember you'. 'You prescribed for me 20 years ago' and I can't remember where it was, why?

137
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:36,899
 Because it was 2,3 symptoms on the
 telephone and I said, take this remedy.

138
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:50,019
I remember one time I was struggling with a case of duodenal ulcer and I had given Nux-v. and Ant-c. etc.

139
00:27:50,020 --> 00:28:06,140
One day this man who was a scientist, he telephoned me and says,' I have a meeting in the school

140
00:28:06,141 --> 00:28:18,199
 I go as a parent and I cannot face it, I'm trembling'. 'I said what? You cannot face it? How come?'

141
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:25,389
 He says, 'all my life when I have to do
 this in a meeting it is not possible'.

142
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,809
'OK, take a dose of Gels.  just before you go there'.

143
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:38,170
Next time he comes, he says 'for the
 first time my stomach is very good'.

144
00:28:38,171 --> 00:28:49,559
Because this remedy was not Nux-v., was not Nit-ac., was not all these nonsense I was prescribing, it was Gels.

145
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:59,519
Since then, I just saw him the other day, I said never again you had the problem? He said never again.

146
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:06,599
And I'm talking about 1969 or 70.

147
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:19,960
And it was this information, he said 'I can't face, I will be trembling because I'm going to speak in front of 10-15 people'

148
00:29:19,961 --> 00:29:24,920
 the parents of the class of his boy.

149
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:37,920
Because this is the essence of the whole thing which I had not taken into consideration, he never thought of

150
00:29:37,921 --> 00:29:39,479
 mentioning to me.

151
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:46,939
Symptoms tend to fluctuate according to the fluctuation of the urine. That is what I explained to you.

152
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:56,799
You get a relief of the physical symptoms, the pains, the swellings and the urine is heavy.

153
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:05,039
You get clear urine and the symptoms are...
That fluctuation indicates the remedy.

154
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:13,139
The patient will say, \when I have a clear urine,
 I don't feel well'. And this is the idea.

155
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:26,600
The preference of this remedy
 to cure suppressed gonorrhea.

156
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,599
After suppressed gonorrhea
there is hemorrhoids, fistulas.

157
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:39,509
Dribbling of urine in old men
with enlarged prostate.

158
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:46,060
If you take that symptom of course
 you will find it in 55 remedies.

159
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:56,979
What you have to have is the original things we said about this Benz-ac. in order to prescribe.

160
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:05,880
You don't prescribe Benz-ac. because there is dribbling of urine in enlarged prostate because we have

161
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:09,720
 a lot of other remedies, which have that symptom.

162
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:25,359
Involuntary biting of lower lip,
that's something which is peculiar.

163
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:36,839
Headaches of rheumatic origin alternate or accompanied by rheumatic conditions.

164
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:51,079
You see how we stress the idea of smelly urine.

165
00:31:51,080 --> 00:32:03,609
 Every symptom we say but it has to have urine which is very strong in odor, very heavy in color.

166
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,839
This remedy you will meet in cases
where they belong to the first group.

167
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:45,609
People who get gonorrhea belong to the first group. They are strong constitutions, otherwise they don't get gonorrhea.

168
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:56,360
They get gonorrhea and then the gonorrhea is not going right through to the mental to produce the anxiety

169
00:32:56,361 --> 00:33:09,460
and to produce the hurried feelings and all that but it goes into the joints, it is a strong organism who can do that.

170
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:24,219
And you have to be careful, not simply offensive urine, it has to be heavy in color, very dark yellow.

171
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:33,970
And if you let the urine, the urine will settle
  down and will have some sediments.
