1
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:30,319
They also have vertigo in high places
 but they will go up to find 5th floor.

2
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:45,599
Then we have Staph. and Nat-m.

3
00:00:47,430 --> 00:01:05,880
But Sulph. also and these two remedies both Sulph. and Calc., you will hear them saying that if they drive to a place where there is a cliff

4
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:18,400
the idea of having a cliff there makes them absolutely dizzy. It paralyzes them.

5
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:27,380
They will go almost to the opposite
driving in order to avoid the cliff.

6
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:41,699
Because as they go along they feel the emptiness and the vertigo is strong.
Then you prescribe Calc. or Sulph.

7
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,840
You have to have information of that kind.

8
00:01:46,841 --> 00:01:56,039
The Calc. has another characteristic of vertigo which is, can anybody remember it?

9
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:16,199
When they see other people, you see they are sitting here and they see somebody gone on the 5th floor and lean down there.

10
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:26,669
'They say my God! Please come in
 I cannot see you standing there'.

11
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:36,419
One more characteristic of vertigo in high
places to all Calc.? Do you remember?

12
00:02:45,920 --> 00:03:00,999
In their sleep they see dreams with vertigo high places. They see that they are in a high place and that they have vertigo.

13
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:15,439
When vertigo is mentioned as a symptom and
 we take it in order to make our prescription,
it has to be something strong.

14
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:27,749
We can support our cases with vertigo high places underlined one or not at all underlined
 but usually is not going to be Calc.

15
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,679
If the Calc. they have vertigo at all, it's
going to be quite strong.

16
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:53,879
Also vertigo in high places there is
 another remedy which is Staph.

17
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:19,200
Staph. is more fear than vertigo.
Something between fear and vertigo.

18
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,959
Why fear? Does anybody know?

19
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:50,679
Fear of high places because Staph. sometimes has the impulse to jump from high places.

20
00:04:50,680 --> 00:05:00,279
If they look from high places they have
the impulse to jump like Arg-n. mostly.

21
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:16,759
Now we're coming to the point where we must differentiate between Aur. impulse to jump from
 a high place, Staph. and Gels.

22
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:26,079
They are shades of symptomatology
here. And it's not very clear.

23
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:35,170
Impulse to jump from a
high place on Repertory.

24
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:48,309
It says here 'impulse to jump
into the river':  Arg-n., Sec., Sil.

25
00:05:48,310 --> 00:06:05,959
'Impulse to jump from high place':
 Aur., Staph., Arg-n., Gels. and Anac..

26
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:39,919
Impulse to jump from a high place for Aur.
 is a completely different thing than Arg-n. and Staph. and Gels.

27
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:58,989
So the differential diagnosis on impulse to jump on Aur. will not be just in a nice condition, he has no problem and he goes to a high place and then he has impulse to jump, no.

28
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:16,399
Aur. will be very depressed, he will have thoughts many times of killing himself and he never knows how. He has not thought how.

29
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:30,709
And the first time he finds himself in the terrace, he goes and looks and he says 'now is your chance'.

30
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:42,319
Out of great depression and as he looks down from high, the more impulse comes that they should jump.

31
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:54,920
But if it's a cool impulse, a cool impulse if you can say. It is not something that you can say they don't know what they are doing.

32
00:07:54,921 --> 00:08:04,760
 Then they know they say, 'This is your chance. Your suffering is going to finish now, you can jump'. Aurum.

33
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:21,879
You see this is the type of impulse that Aur. has out of tremendous depression, sadness, has lost everything.

34
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:31,679
Arg-n. is completely different. His work he is very happy, he is doing everything and he enjoys life etc.

35
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:43,349
And then he finds himself in a high place
and the impulse comes and he can jump.

36
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:57,599
It's another act all together. You see in the Repertory they cannot explain all these things.

37
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:12,599
The Arg-n. is very happy and then he goes to a high place and then the impulse comes and they imagine themselves falling 'Oh! How they will fall down, terrible'.

38
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:29,919
And then almost they put their foot to climb and go down. The moment they start doing the act, they retreat.

39
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:47,370
Now Gels. has also impulse to jump
 but it's again a quite different affair.

40
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:58,919
It is usually done in a hazy state
 of mind. The mind is hazy.

41
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:12,679
They have been suffering and suffering with headaches and things like that.
 I'm suffering, my life is turn into pieces.

42
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:27,009
And then they go there to the balcony and almost they let themselves being drawn by the height.

43
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:51,009
It is a passive act of impulse. Like letting themselves to fall from a high place, it is that
 type of individual.

44
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:11,189
In Staph. is fear. They have fear and vertigo,
 they are afraid, they don't know of what they
 are afraid. 'There is a vertigo but I have a tendency to jump'.

45
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:21,179
Also Staph's they are not supposed
 to be mentally ill like Arg-n.

46
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:28,689
It's not an act of suicide
 so much as an impulse.

47
00:11:52,690 --> 00:12:07,319
Phos. and Puls.  have vertigo from high places also, it is a common vertigo from high places.

48
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:25,409
The accommodation from heights, it suddenly deepens in accommodation in depth and creates a kind of vertigo. This is a pure vertigo, is not very strong.

49
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:38,829
Usually they will have it once or twice in their life in Phos. and Puls. It can be there, 'Yes, I have vertigo in high places'.

50
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:53,359
Phos. will say 'yes, yes, yes!'. But you feel
it's not so strong, he says it in some way.

51
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:12,239
Where the other remedies will describe to you, they will tell you about their vertigo because vertigo is a big thing.

52
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:37,930
So even with one symptom, we go in Materia Medica, we can differentiate one remedy from another and then you will see and say, no that
 is not Gels.. it's Aur. Or it's not Aur., it's Gels.

53
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:59,379
Then you repertorize, take certain symptoms but be careful that the intensity of the symptom tallies with the intensity of the symptom of the patient.

54
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:08,049
The intensity of the symptom of the remedy underlined 3 times, tallies with the intensity of the symptom of the patient.

55
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:16,389
Vertigo 3 times, Calc., Sulph., Arg-n.

56
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:40,300
But vertigo not underlined...Calc.
 something is wrong. Maybe it's not
underlined, may be many things.
