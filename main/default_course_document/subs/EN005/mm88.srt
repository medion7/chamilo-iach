1
00:00:47,720 --> 00:01:02,099
Manc. is an interesting remedy which in the beginning of my prescribing, I used to prescribe very infrequently, once every two years.

2
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,930
Until I came to know better Manc. and today
 it is prescribed much more frequently.

3
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,169
Manc. is mainly I would say a phobic remedy.

4
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,649
But a remedy which covers a
specific realm of phobias.

5
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:51,679
So we have to have these combinations of fears and phobias that will give eventually the state of Manc.

6
00:01:52,540 --> 00:02:19,279
Manc. I found it is indicated mostly again in women. And in individuals that are weak in will, with a weak will power and also weak intellect.

7
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:42,609
The intellect looks like the one that we recognize in Arg-n. but Manc. has not the impulsiveness of Arg-n.

8
00:02:51,200 --> 00:03:09,999
Now this combination of weak will and weak intellect allows for certain fixed ideas to enter the mind and take hold of the mind.

9
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:53,939
In the beginning stages we'll see fixed ideas like a man may think that his wife is not really a woman but she is a homosexual who had an operation and now is a woman.

10
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:04,359
That is a crazy idea that sticks to the
 mind and he cannot get rid of that.

11
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,359
It is an insane idea.

12
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:28,909
His rational mind understands that this is an irrational thought and he tries to get it out of his mind.

13
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,849
But the more he tries to get it out,
 the more it gets hold of him.

14
00:04:49,180 --> 00:05:00,499
They develop all kinds of these fixed ideas, especially in the night, in the darkness.

15
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,440
Fear of going out in the night alone.

16
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:30,969
 In the night they have different ideas
 coming and get hold of them.

17
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:45,519
For instance they have the impression that the cupboard is open and they look they are absolutely certain that the cupboard is open.

18
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:56,119
And this idea that it's open, I have to close it. Eventually they have to get up and close it but the cupboard is closed.

19
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:11,096
This imagination which goes on in the darkness, you may confuse it with what remedy?

20
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:19,479
-Causticum.
-No. In the darkness where they produce shapes?

21
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:41,799
Phos. mostly has that. In the darkness they imagine things. People standing there, shapes of different animals.

22
00:06:47,880 --> 00:07:02,399
Here is not the imagination so much that causes the fear but it is the fixed idea that this has happened. The cupboard is open.

23
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:09,319
It is a fixed idea that they believe it is so.
So they get up to close it.

24
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:22,289
Now they have all these kinds of fears, fixed ideas that they cannot get them out of their mind.

25
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:37,299
Eventually the idea gets upon their mind that they are going crazy, which is characteristic of Manc.

26
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:46,799
They will try and battle to get away
 the idea that they are going crazy.

27
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,889
The idea is fixed, they are going crazy. The person itself tries to battle and says 'no I'm not getting crazy'.

28
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:15,319
It says no, you're getting crazy, you're not getting crazy. So it starts inside a battle which is very true. Eventually it develops more and more and takes most of their time.

29
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:27,140
It takes most of their free time. My mind
 is going crazy. It's a fear, it's a panic.

30
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:48,320
'I shall not think about. I shall
remove it from my mind'.

31
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:55,150
But again the idea comes suddenly in their
 mind. 'You're going crazy'.

32
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,609
So this battle becomes very characteristic of Manc., the battle of 'I'm getting crazy, no I'm not getting crazy.'

33
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:21,670
There is another remedy who has that battle which makes them tired of that mental battle.

34
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:34,229
 A suicidal remedy, they battle to kill themselves or not to kill themselves.

35
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:51,089
Nat-s. It has a similar battle inside them which drives them almost to the point of being tired from that battle.

36
00:09:53,710 --> 00:10:08,600
Where the impulse is to just finish with this lifeyou had enough, this is not a life, this is not a world to live and then inside them they say

37
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:22,039
 no, no, I must resist. I have my children, whatever relatives and I'm going to give them a lot of pain. I should not do it for them'.

38
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:28,009
 And then again comes the idea, kill yourself, finish.

39
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:38,679
No, there is no way. And again, no I should not do it. This kind of battle, a similar battle on another remedy.

40
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:53,929
There is the peculiarity of these remedies and when you see that battle, the people will tell you, they will express these battles.

41
00:10:53,930 --> 00:11:05,899
Whether is for being crazy or for
committing suicide is Manc. or Nat-s.

42
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:35,799
As it progresses this idea of going crazy, there comes darkness when they go to sleep. In the darkness there is an aggravation and the ideas take hold more and more.

43
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:46,069
We have fear of insanity during night, which is the remedy mostly which is mentioned in our Repertory?

44
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:57,549
-Calc.?
-No.
-Nat-m.?
-No.

45
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:10,399
A remedy which has aggravation in the night in general, is a syphilitic remedy. Mercury.

46
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:25,399
Merc. may develop similar pattern of Manc. in the night and is a tremendous idea coming to the mind, I'm getting crazy.

47
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:34,179
And they jump out of bed and they put on the light. I have to have some light and get over that state.

48
00:12:42,560 --> 00:13:03,919
But when they are in the consultation room, they will not describe it in vivid colors, they will discuss it but they will not give you the exact words that you expect.

49
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:18,119
But if you enquire more and more, they will come up with the idea. They will make gestures like that. 'Something is wrong with my head.'

50
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:37,049
'What it is? You're losing your mind?', 'Yes, yes. That's exactly what happens. But I resist'. They will say, they resist. This is characteristic.

51
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:19,600
As the pathology progresses, the idea comes that during this they will become crazy and during that crazy spell, they're going to kill their own child.

52
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:37,879
We have other remedies which they have impulse to kill their own child, which are the remedies?

53
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,129
-Platina.

54
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:58,679
-Arg-n. is one, Sulph. is another, Nux-v.,
Thea, also, Plat. yes.

55
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:09,530
Plat. has impulse to kill in
 general and Merc. also.

56
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:25,319
With Manc. is not an impulse so much, as the fear that they will get crazy and then during that craziness, they will kill their child.

57
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:40,119
It is not the impulse when they see something. There is a fear, 'I'm going crazy and when I'm going crazy, I'm going to kill my child'.

58
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:48,639
It's deeper. It's not the impulse
that we see in other remedies.

59
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:09,859
Other remedies they will see a pistol, a tool that will give them the impulse to kill. Manc. will have the idea of being crazy first and then she wants to kill the child.

60
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:53,719
During that time of crisis, they will almost shout out of fear and panic, especially if they are in an environment where it is conducive.

61
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:04,519
And they know that something is wrong now, they will let the child and shout out of fear.

62
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:37,719
Together with these characteristics that we mentioned already, we have another characteristic where we have a theme that
the soul of the person lives in darkness.

63
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:48,309
It's in darkness which
 pervades the whole person.

64
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:04,781
And this dark element will come through
 their describing to you their inner state.

65
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:15,839
That dark element eventually in some cases
 will personify in the idea of devil.

66
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:26,839
The idea of devil comes into their
 minds eventually in deeper form.

67
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:58,839
They will say that the devil is wanting them to be crazy, that the devil is responsible for the crazy  thoughts which are in their mind.

68
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:13,999
Some other times there is a dark element as we said and that dark element pervades the soul and also the sexual instinct, quite a lot.

69
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:37,039
Therefore there is perversion in the sexual instinct and a woman for instance will have a kind of desire concerning her brother or her father.

70
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:58,399
That, she understands it's not right and then out of guilt, personifies the father or the brother and then they appear to her as devils.

71
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:11,649
'My brother looks to me like devil. When I look at his eyes, he looks like the devil. When I look my father, he looks like the devil'.

72
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:23,039
This dark element eventually you will see in their description of cases, how it comes down to the idea of the devil.

73
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:33,879
And in the Repertory says, fear of being taken
 by the devil. They have delusions.

74
00:20:46,550 --> 00:21:01,959
One of the patients says, she has a lot of dreams with snakes but the snakes symbolize her own brother. And she kills the snakes.

75
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:18,599
The snakes in her dream it was as if it was the brother and she killed the snake. The snake is a symbol of sexualism.

76
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:42,599
And she says, 'I see my brother as a devil and I avoid to look at his side'. Consciously she says that; unconsciously is the darkness in that element.

77
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:49,199
We know Manc. has this sexuality.

78
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:59,129
But the idea of devil does not come
 until certain pathology develops.

79
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:22,469
The idea is expressed explicitly that the word has a connection either with the inside, with the fighting, the devil wants to put his ideas in her and she is fighting the devil.

80
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:29,909
Or some other person outside is a devil
 and wants to do something to her.

81
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:39,809
You see the mind how is undermined and the
will is undermined and these thoughts get it.

82
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:59,439
These cases are developing more and more in our today's society with the way that we live and the society we have developed.

83
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:09,490
And this remedy is going to be needed
more and more in your prescribing. It will do wonders when it's indicated.

84
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:24,719
The persons are suffering tremendously because it's not fear of devil you don't feel anything. When you hear the person saying, when you see them describing their state that they're going crazy,

85
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:43,059
you feel that what they are going through is a very shaky balance on which they walk. The least mistake will overturn them and they'll go crazy.

86
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,059
This is the impression they give and they suffer tremendously.

87
00:23:49,060 --> 00:24:01,009
And the dark element and this idea of devil and this fighting inside starts to compose the idea of Manc.

88
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:22,097
Another thing that happens is that they go to sleep and suddenly They will see different kinds of color which they don't exist and then the fear comes.

89
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:49,929
'Oh, I'm going crazy' They have the impression that a kind of animal is going through. They turn around...it's a kind of jerk inside the brain.

90
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:50,880
The moment they get this fear is like jerking inside the brain. They look there and there is a picture on the wall, they look in there and they see the picture moving.

91
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:30,319
'I'm getting crazy', they paralyze, they will stop working. They're looking like lost people because all the time they have optical delusions.

92
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:50,319
Colours, moving objects, moving pictures on the wall. Somebody may have an optical delusion because he has something in the eyes but they don't take care.

93
00:25:50,320 --> 00:26:01,039
For these people this phenomenon becomes a causative factor for the fear to jump up with tremendous intensity.

94
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:41,439
So this fighting of the devil, the expression of the person, you may confuse it with another remedy.

95
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:59,499
With Anacardium, fighting the evil forces. But in Anacardium always is the conflict between good and bad. Love and hatred.

96
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:08,819
In Manc. is the battle between myself and the devil. Myself and the evil forces.

97
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:54,959
And when they are reaching that state, going crazy or constant battle of the darkness etc. usually the sexual sphere is affected in a way and they attract sexual situations which are perverted.

98
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:11,879
And they go to the situation and the mind is confused and the will is weak and then they come out of the situation and they look back, and say what have I done?

99
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:21,639
The husband is the devil, the devil who has forced upon her a sexual intercourse which is not normal.

100
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:49,269
And these ideas they go on for years. And then in these cases during that time of being in that state, they develop solace in church in religion.

101
00:28:49,270 --> 00:29:07,689
So what they do? They pray and they say,
 'God save me from being crazy. I don't want
 to be crazy, god please help me'.

102
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:29,749
In that respect when they will describe to you they will look like Aurum because there is depression in them. You feel very depressed individual.

103
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,999
And then you see the praying
and your mind goes to Aurum.

104
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:49,039
The Aurum prays in two different situations.

105
00:29:52,760 --> 00:30:05,759
The one situation is where without knowing why they have the need to pray constantly.

106
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:19,249
And they go on praying, they go out praying. Wherever they are, they feel that they should pray constantly. Without knowing why, where it comes from.

107
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:30,516
They understand that it's too much. They say,
'I pray too much but I cannot do otherwise'. This is one type of praying for Aurum.

108
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:47,919
Another type is when they have been in a state of depression, real depression and they feel that they have lost all kind of connections with anything in the world.

109
00:30:47,920 --> 00:31:06,627
They don't have anything to turn, to hold in the world. No husband, no children, no interest in their own home no interest in their friends, nothing.

110
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:25,910
And then the element of darkness coming upon them and then there is a feeling as if everything material has completely vanished and give no hope to that individual.

111
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:40,079
Then out of that complete detachment from material things he feels that now is the time, there is no meaning for me anymore.

112
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:53,879
That moment where the thoughts become conscious about that, he turns into God and says 'God help me' with the idea that they're going to die.

113
00:31:54,050 --> 00:32:02,329
They're going to jump. 'Tomorrow, when I get up' because the Aurum aggravation is in the night and these things come in the night.

114
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:11,249
They think 'tomorrow it's going to be my last day. I cannot support that situation anymore. Tomorrow is the last day.'

115
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:35,719
But they receive that this isn't logical, this is not normal. So once they've given up completely, the idea of holding in something material, they turn on to spiritual.

116
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:53,239
It is not a spirituality which is going to stay. It is not something which comes out of a habit. It comes during the time of desperation and depression.

117
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:05,390
Tremendous desperation with a coldness inside, with a darkness inside. 'God help me'.

118
00:33:05,391 --> 00:33:16,289
 And this will give them a solace. This idea
will put them to bed, will put them to sleep.

119
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,879
That's Aurum.

120
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:32,459
 The Manc. will pray out of the fear of being crazy. The dark element inside her.

121
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:50,639
Manc. is enjoying herself in this world.The  Aurum does not enjoy things, has lost any kind of enjoyment in material world.

122
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,840
Manc. is enjoying, is inolving herself.

123
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:15,129
Is an emotional person who needs the enjoyment of life. It's not a big depression and a big indifference to everything. No, not such thing.

124
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:34,759
But the intellect is weak and the idea comes 'I'm going to get crazy' and then the darkness inside, the evil forces that are trying to do that and then 'God help me'.

125
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:56,280
If you take it very superficially, 'praying' you may confuse Manc. or even Verat., Lach., all these they have a kind of religious insanity.

126
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,799
-What do you mean they enjoy themselves?

127
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:12,790
-Making the distinction between Aurum and Manc. Aurum do not enjoy anything in life, nothing is pleasure.

128
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:18,169
For Manc. everything is pleasure.

129
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:32,779
The sex, the food, the going out, the talking, everything we do gives  pleasure. To Aurum is pleasure. Both they reach a state where they pray.

130
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:43,959
Sometimes Manc. also out of this battle, these ideas which are crazy and they come year after year, they get tired.

131
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:51,239
They get absolutely tired with this situation and they think of committing suicide.

132
00:35:51,240 --> 00:36:10,779
They have tendency to commit suicide, a suicidal part in Manc. at a certain point but then as soon as the ideas come, again the idea of evil comes into place.

133
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:20,439
So they say, the devil tells me to commit suicide, I'm not going to commit suicide. Because it's the devil who tells me to do it.

134
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:32,080
Another similarity you'll see between Manc. and Arg-n., there are ideas that come in their mind.

135
00:36:32,081 --> 00:36:48,149
 A Manc. is driving with the car and 1,5 meter away there is a man, she is passing with the car and then the idea comes, I have hit this person.

136
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:56,769
And they cannot continue going that way, they have to go all around back again to come back to see if they did not kill the person.

137
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,119
They have the impression they've killed.

138
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:38,689
So this looks like Arg-n. Also Arg-n. is from a high place. When Manc. has fear of a high place, they will describe exactly the way that Arg-n. will tell you the story that they fear.

139
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:50,549
When they see a height, they see themselves falling down and everything was in pieces.

140
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,720
It is very similar to Arg-n.

141
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:17,479
Similar ideas that stick to their mind, for instance that they pass with the car, they read something wrong and the policeman took their name.

142
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:24,879
So the policeman now has my number and
 I will   get a ticket. Without a reason really.

143
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:42,799
Also fear of cancer and that again sticks as a fixed idea, 'I have cancer, no I do not have cancer'.

144
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:54,299
Fear of dead people. And it makes it
very difficult for them to go to a funeral.

145
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:16,269
So it is understandable how a Manc., that type of person, will be anti-social person. They don't like to go into great gatherings.

146
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:21,279
Also they have a lack of self-confidence.

147
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:34,999
In a big party they will the last
to get up and dance and associate.

148
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,359
-How that goes together with what
you say, they enjoy everything?

149
00:39:44,360 --> 00:40:02,119
-They enjoy inside. They have not lost the feelings. They have the sense that they are half human beings almost because of that weakness which they have.

150
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:08,799
But their feelings are alive and they enjoy everything. They will sit there, watch and enjoy.

151
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:17,119
They do not have the self confidence to get up and take part and dance and associate.

152
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:33,279
And this kind of weakness, makes them have a feeling of being attached to the people who are living with.

153
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,359
Manc. depends a lot to the
people who is living with.

154
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:52,399
The husband, wife, the parents,
 whoever is there.

155
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:07,519
And because of that attachment and that dependence, they develop an anxiety about the well-being of others.

156
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:32,239
You see in the books we have Ars., Bar-c.,
 Phos., Sulph. for the anxiety about others., Cocc.

157
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:40,549
Each remedy has a peculiar anxiety about others. Now you can see Manc. how she is anxious.

158
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:51,177
She knows it's so deep that she has to have somebody to support her in times of weakness, especially in the night when she will have these fears.

159
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:56,869
And if something happens, they worry a lot.

160
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:23,427
That is similar to Ars. but Ars. is
not presenting this kind of weakness.

161
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:38,239
Bar-c., they are attached. It's the type of attachment of Bar-c. Because they feel inefficient the Bar-c. They want to hold on to someone who is strong.

162
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,609
 More or less the same with Manc. But the idea that they need this person. The same as Ars.

163
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:57,649
But Ars. do not feel this type
of weakness of intellect as Manc.

164
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,679
Where Phos. and Sulph. have
 completely different anxiety.

165
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:31,199
Also in Manc. I've seen another element. Because of that innermost weakness which they feel, they want to project in the society an idea of strength, of being strong.

166
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:40,589
They will not go around and tell that I'm weak. They rather present an idea that they are strong.

167
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:59,599
Therefore they present an idea which is different from the one they feel. They feel very weak.

168
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:07,879
But they say, I don't like that. I want to be
strong. Again the same idea, this conflict.

169
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:27,369
'I' weak, no I'm not weak, I don't want to
 be weak, I want to be strong but I'm weak.'

170
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:50,330
They tell themselves, 'I'm strong, I can
 do this, no you cannot do, you're weak'.

171
00:44:50,331 --> 00:44:57,839
 This is an inner battle which is going on and we try when they describe that case they will say

172
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:09,039
'usually when I feel weak I try to persuade
myself that I'm strong but I know I'm weak'.

173
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,599
-It sounds a little bit like Lyc.

174
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:27,959
-Lyc. they believe, it's a good question. Lyc. also deep down they are weak but they present an idea of being very strong.

175
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:46,009
Lyc. is external appearances. That means when they find themselves in a situation that no harm can be done, they can say anything.

176
00:45:46,010 --> 00:46:02,505
Especially in women they make stories. They may say a story where a snake was, a big snake and I took the snake, they imagine that.

177
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:14,869
When a snake appears really in front of them, they run away. When the real thing happens to show courage, they are absolutely cowards.

178
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:29,399
But when there is no danger involved, they are the big men, the strong men, 'I can do this and that, I can fight with 3 people'.

179
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:36,759
When somebody bigger than them will say, 'go away', immediately they will go away.

180
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,319
That is the type.

181
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:02,829
Lyc. is one of the most cowardice
 remedies of the Materia Medica.

182
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:11,809
And Gels. also. But for different
reasons all together.

183
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:27,130
Manc. gets for instance, irritable
 inside and they will try not to show it.

184
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:38,709
They prefer small groups, they dislike large groups of people and sometimes they have a fear of crowds.

185
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:53,960
They are very easily offended but
they will not express their anger.

186
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:03,139
They lack the sense of humor
and they appear quite serious.

187
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:49,347
Such states of Manc. they will come about after a shock which has these elements inside.

188
00:48:50,755 --> 00:49:07,399
For instance seeing a film, like 'The Exorcist',
 a Manc. state can start from this.

189
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:20,279
Somebody who is Manc. can start from having a shock of that type, where evil forces are involved.

190
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:39,689
Also you will see a great fear of
something bad is going to happen.

191
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:52,709
And something bad which is indescribable eventually crystallizes in the idea, I'm going crazy.

192
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:04,119
The idea of something bad is going to happen,
is inside. It's going to happen to me.

193
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:10,480
Sometimes you will see a great
 thirst before menses.

194
00:50:50,040 --> 00:51:14,760
Physical ailments that can be cured by Manc., Respiratory system affected with hay fever, bronchitis. Skin eruptions, oily skin, colitis.

195
00:51:14,761 --> 00:51:24,529
But mostly they will be treated for this mental-emotional state which I have described.

196
00:51:52,660 --> 00:52:05,270
You can also sometimes confuse it with Puls.  because Manc. tends to be towards the warm side.

197
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:12,000
They cry a lot.

198
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:30,640
 And like Puls. they are kind of
withdrawn or timid.

199
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:41,709
 They weep out of self pitty.

200
00:52:54,150 --> 00:53:00,480
Which are the remedies that
 have fear of insanity strong?

201
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:18,000
Calc., Cann-i., Puls. and Manc. They are the first core remedies which have fear of insanity very strong.

202
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:31,999
Like Puls., Manc. they are ameliorated
 by motion, by movement.

203
00:53:49,000 --> 00:54:01,069
And therefore because they are timid, they will not get up and dance in front of a group easily but when they're at home, they put on the music and they dance.

204
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:05,020
Because motion ameliorates
them, it's like Sepia.

205
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:18,719
Now you have a whole picture of this remedy. With the fear of insanity, with the battle inside, with the darkness which comes more and more

206
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:28,849
 in their soul, with sexual involvement and optical delusions, immediately is referred to the mind.

207
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:41,359
'I'm getting crazy', with the idea 'I'm getting crazy I'll kill my children'. And that picture when you see it, Manc.

208
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,120
And I'm sure you'll recognize
from now on these cases.

209
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:58,200
-They will always know that they have this conflict?

210
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:10,680
-Not always but in most of the cases I've seen. They say, 'I have battled with this idea a lot. I don't want to be there'.

211
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:26,959
And many times they will say it's the devil's work. 'I know it's terrible that happens but I cannot get rid of that'. Most of the cases I've seen that.

212
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,649
- They are going crazy?

213
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:55,739
-I don't know because I've seen these
cases with Manc., we've stopped them.

214
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:06,340
I have not seen further pathology where
 they turn crazy and they still are Manc.

215
00:56:06,341 --> 00:56:15,209
Most of the cases I have seen in the phobic states where Manc. has acted beautifully.

216
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,159
This state cannot be tolerated it very long. It's a very saddening state for the person and then you have to take drugs to relieve that kind of state.

217
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:36,879
-Do they also have fear of being
 possesed by the devil?

218
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:45,720
-Yes exactly that's the idea. They will tell exactly I'm possessed by the devil. They'll described in other words.

219
00:56:50,560 --> 00:57:14,627
- I had a case and she said that the devil told her that God was the devil and he was very scared about that and that the devil worked through her.

220
00:57:15,309 --> 00:57:25,679
-Now in this case we're not sure about Manc. What we need is the element of this darkness upon the person.

221
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:39,689
There is an element of darkness which comes out, you see something which is not light and then you see the fear of insanity.

222
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:49,269
The fear that they are going crazy themselves. This is not enough to prescribe Manc.

223
00:57:49,270 --> 00:58:06,809
This could be Kali-br. Cursed by God etc.
This idea may not be Manc.

224
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:21,679
-She had a fear of going crazy. At the same
time it was more light. Maybe it's not Manc.

225
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:36,399
-Why this  remedy is coming more and more?

226
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:53,421
-Because of the way that we live. The way we live like 'The Exorcist' the film is a product of our society.

227
00:59:47,030 --> 01:00:00,299
Also the people go for things, for experimental things which are the brim of tolerance and limits.

228
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:12,699
Today's society has broken down the limits, has gone for things, for experiences which are beyond the  endurance of the system.

229
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:28,119
They push. You know the Essalen
 experiment in America?

230
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:50,199
It's a famous institute in America with all kinds of experimental ideas which are very new, very fresh, very crazy and they take place.

231
01:00:50,200 --> 01:01:02,739
They just originate from that Institute. That Institute is run now by people who are very intelligent.

232
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:17,719
One of these men who was running the Institute a few years ago, was one of the 10 most promising men in United States.

233
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:46,949
And one of my students had a connection with this Institute. And in 1980 we had a seminar.

234
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:56,209
Then I came in contact with the ideas that were going on and they pushed me,  just to give you an idea.

235
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:14,839
What crazy idea could go on. People would go there to learn to grow vegetables with natural chemicals.

236
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:34,459
So it was a group of 30-40 people, were the only ones who had books, no books were allowed for these activities which were going on there.

237
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:17,399
But the people who were digging the ground, producing the vegetables etc. they were all naked. The only one with clothes was me.

238
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:40,148
And you walk there, they don't pay any attention. I mean this experience, is not the nakedness so much that is important but the idea that they push themselves to the limits, the experiment.

239
01:03:40,248 --> 01:03:48,479
Two people they jumped out and they committed suicide, while this experiment was taking place.

240
01:03:48,480 --> 01:04:07,529
Excitement and what they thing is pleasant is pushing the individuals endurance of intellect and emotionality to the limit, and they go out of balance.

241
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:16,539
And once it's out of balance that society
is going to create Manc's, Merc's etc.

242
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:34,989
That's why I say that today we have Manc. I used to prescribe once every two years, here now in the last six months perhaps 10 cases of Manc.

243
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:56,279
-She was convinced that she was right what she said? But Manc. will be in doubt.

244
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:07,759
-Manc. will be in doubt. Not only she will
 be in doubt but she will fight.

245
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:54,559
-This kind of fight means that he or she has to put the devil there herself? Because sometimes people who have troubles they go to the priest and then another person uses the idea on the first place. You prescribe Manc. then?

246
01:05:54,560 --> 01:06:14,279
-No. It is an idea that happens inside, not with the other person. Also it's not just an idea, it is a fear, a panic.

247
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:31,169
Because somebody may tell you and not have an effect on you but if it has such a profound effect then Manc. maybe indicated in such cases.

248
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:37,848
In a Manc. case you give Puls., they are close.

249
01:06:47,830 --> 01:07:04,359
And then it takes away the fear of insanity. But the impulse to kill the child is still there etc. You do not really see a deep action of the remedy.

250
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:28,879
You can imagine when you're shooting with 20 remedy what happens. It's creating confusion because too many attacking on symptoms.
