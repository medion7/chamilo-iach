1
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:54,949
Ant-t. has a lot of similarities with Ant-c.

2
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:06,959
The only difference is in Ant-c. there is a catarrh of the stomach.

3
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,610
In Ant-t. there is a catarrh of the lungs.

4
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:37,299
It is the main remedy when there is weakness, catarrh of the lungs,  the lungs are becoming full of mucus

5
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:48,139
  and there is a noise which can be heard by all people around.

6
00:01:52,170 --> 00:02:02,659
Old people who are suffering with chronic bronchitis usually have that. When they come in an exhaustion state

7
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,930
when they approach death...

8
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:25,149
 and you hear a lot of mucus in the lungs and there is no strength to bring it out that is the time for Ant-t.

9
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:41,869
We have said certain things about Ant-c. and especially the peevishness and this type that we see in Cham.

10
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:58,410
in Cina, in Calc-p., a similar thing we see with Ant-c. in the children when they have upset stomachs.

11
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:06,059
The same peevishness the same kind, 'don't come near me, don't touch me!'.

12
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:17,689
The idea is very strong with Cham., with Arn., with Ant-c. It's also quite strong, not as strong as Ant-c.

13
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,669
but this remedy also has aversion to be touched.

14
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:37,189
They don't want to be touched, that is an inner state that they don't want somebody very close to them.

15
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:47,709
They need isolation, they need to be by themselves. It's a suffering person who wants to be by himself.

16
00:03:47,710 --> 00:04:01,509
They can become quite impossible, especially the children they will shout and behave like Cham.

17
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:17,529
but when the ailment is in the lungs, then you prefer to give Ant-t. especially with asthma children

18
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:30,179
where they suffer during the night and there is a lot of rattling.

19
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:55,609
Difficult children with asthmatic conditions, with a lot of rattling  in the night, they will get Ant-t. and they will feel better.

20
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:05,699
The asthma is a condition, especially when it is established, it is a condition when it will need 2-3 remedies

21
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,799
before you cure the case.

22
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:30,039
Also when this remedy is indicated, the person wants to vomit in order to bring out the mucus. The mucus has

23
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:38,279
 nothing to do with the vomiting the area is different but still they vomit, they bring out mucus from the chest.

24
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:42,099
The same thing with Ipecacuanha.

25
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:51,179
Ip. is very similar to this remedy in asthmatic conditions, especially of the children.

26
00:05:51,760 --> 00:06:04,859
It has strong rattling, nausea but the prostration of this remedy is different.

27
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:16,659
You see the difficulty. You have a pneumonia case where it has gone a little bit further and the child

28
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:30,489
is battling with this and then it's prostrated and then 'leave me alone', it's not Bry., it's Ant-t.

29
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:42,809
They will behave like Bry., they will behave like Cham. but you see the prostration, you hear the rattling

30
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:55,889
and the tendency to vomit then the remedy is Ant-t.

31
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:09,239
So with this great accumulation, with great prostration, there is a strong sleepiness of course.

32
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,409
Because the organism is deteriorating and wants to recover.

33
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:33,149
So what you will see in children especially, you will see children that you don't believe the can sleep with this cough

34
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,890
and they sleep and it continues.

35
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:49,969
And you don't think that with this cough, this child will sleep and yet it will fall asleep.

36
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:55,169
You see there are differentiating points which are subtle.

37
00:07:55,170 --> 00:08:03,809
And of course the idea of the sleepiness, while you have this prostration, while you have this cough

38
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:13,389
while you have this inflammation, there is sleepiness and it says yawning during cough.

39
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,259
Of course it is the desire to sleep which brings the yawning.

40
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:31,440
The remedy which will be indicated in very young age and very old age.

41
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:38,379
 Ant-t. is given a lot to the children, a lot to the old people.

42
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:46,189
The old people they say they die either
 from bronchitis or from fracture.

43
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:51,229
They fall down, there is a fracture and eventually from old age.

44
00:08:51,230 --> 00:09:01,139
If they are quite strong. Otherwise they die from heart, cancer and all other. But if they are strong, they will fall down

45
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:15,749
they will have a fracture or the lungs are the weak point of the old persons and then Ant-t. can give them a lease of life.

46
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:33,339
It is very interesting how, and we cannot explain it, how a new remedy is coming upon a person.

47
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:41,339
He has an accident, he has a fear, he has a shock, he has this, he has that and then the picture changes.

48
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:48,220
Then you have to go, first this picture, then the underlying.

49
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,319
You have to be very careful when you take the case, what happens?

50
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:12,039
Just because we have this old man and we're talking about, a year and a half ago, he had a vertigo.

51
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:29,429
He tried to get up from bed and he had very stiff neck as a cervical syndrome and he had vertigo and he fell down.

52
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:46,660
He asked me to go to see him and he was lying in bed, he was terrified, he was really terrified.

53
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:59,159
Because his whole family has a history of brain strokes and his father died 72, his sister 74, all the family around 70.

54
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:05,799
That's why he used to say to me 1 more year, he was terrified of stroke.

55
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:21,079
Now he had this incident with the vertigo and I gave him Sulph., first remedy, without much taking of the case.

56
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:33,719
Then I found out that nothing was happening and I waited and he was terrified. I saw his blood pressure

57
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:40,360
every time I tried to take it, is high. Then I wait, it's coming down.

58
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:51,039
And then this anxiety and this influence of I'm going to take my blood pressure.

59
00:11:53,780 --> 00:12:01,450
Then I got the idea of Phos.

60
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:11,889
 Once I gave him Phos. then he started feeling better, more important is the next day  he was not as anxious

61
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:26,639
 as he was all these days. I kept him for 2-3 weeks expecting that Sulph. would have some effect. No.

62
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:39,619
I gave him Phos. the next day he was calmer and a few days later, he came out of his house and he started circulating.

63
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:44,389
He was terrified with the idea of having a brain stroke.

64
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:52,699
And vertigo for him was a prodrome for a stroke.

65
00:12:53,670 --> 00:13:01,539
 He was terrified and I did not realize and the shock of the vertigo changed the picture.

66
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:08,250
It brought out a Phos. layer.

67
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:20,359
  In the same way you hit your foot from the bike and you bring a layer, bruises and all that, of Arnica.

68
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:31,309
In that same way, a mental shock can bring a layer of Ignatia and what we have been talking about

69
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:37,279
a layer of Aur-m-n. in her case.

70
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:54,929
You see she has been helped when she was having different elements by Sulph., by Lyc. and Sulph.

71
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:08,949
Or you have a bronchitis, you may need Ant-t.  And then you go back to Caust.

72
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:21,689
The problem that you have to be careful is that once you start a case, then all the remedies you are going to give

73
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:26,599
they have a sequence, they have a logic.

74
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:40,699
It is not take this, take that, take this, take that. It doesn't do harm but it may confuse you in such a way that finally

75
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,819
you can do find head or tail.

76
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,889
That is the dangerous thing.

77
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:11,379
You tell me which is the constitutional remedy for yesterday's case, is it Nat-m. or is it Nit-ac. or Ars.?

78
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:21,119
You cannot say, what is my constitutional remedy. What is the remedy I'm in at the moment.

79
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:29,329
But tell me your constitutional remedy, so if I tell you what is your constitutional remedy or what I think

80
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,799
is your constitutional remedy you are going to be saved, no.

81
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:42,239
I may say a remedy that I may see some elements of that remedy but you may need that remedy, third.

82
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,109
You need first another two remedies which I don't realize.

83
00:15:51,210 --> 00:16:03,329
You're treating a person and is extrovert and you may have given Plat. and then suddenly you see this person

84
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,959
 closing up without much effect.

85
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:15,469
Some grief is coming from the past and brings out a Nat-m. layer. Then you have to give it and then maybe

86
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:21,479
 you continue again with Plat. or you give Sepia, whatever.

87
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:36,069
But if you fix your mind into Plat., like he was saying yesterday and is also the practice of Kunzli.

88
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:51,309
He is a very good doctor, he died but he followed Kent. He has his own experience.

89
00:16:52,380 --> 00:17:04,549
He said, once you find the remedy keep on giving this remedy to the end of his life and repeat, every day for years.

90
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:16,229
This is not my experience. Like this man Sulph., Sulph. 17 years but he has strong constitution.

91
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:26,779
Sulph. and like when he had a bronchitis he needed Bry. and some other remedy, I can't remember now

92
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:32,209
he had severe cold and went to bronchitis.
 Then Sulph. did not help.

93
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,549
 Then I had to go to acute remedies to treat the bronchitis.

94
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:43,430
You cannot say, give Sulph.

95
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:57,509
Sometimes he will get better in spite of Sulph. or in spite of everything you are doing. That is another thing.

96
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,979
You cannot say because I gave Sulph., he is better.

97
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,389
So we're talking about Arg-met.

98
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:24,130
Arg-met. and Arg-n. are quite different persons.

99
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:32,309
Arg-n. is very extroverted, talks, anxieties and all that.

100
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:44,149
Arg-met. is not anxious, is not extrovert. Actually he is unsocial because of the pains.

101
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:57,269
You can imagine somebody who is suffering with his joints a lot, rheumatoid arthritis cases, cartilages, mostly affected.

102
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:09,779
You get the feeling that they want to be by themselves like the Bry. cases.

103
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,549
 They are not interested in social, they don't have energy.

104
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:35,199
Arg-met. is one of the most severe cases of rheumatoid arthritis states with a lot of deformities.

105
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:58,789
It affects also very much the vocal chords and creates a aphonia, like Phos., Caust., Hep.

106
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:20,049
But the vocal chords seem to produce nodes, sclerosis. You see the vocal chord if they are looked

107
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:30,059
they will say that it has calluses, nodes, nodules.

108
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:48,439
The heart also is affected and will be indicated in cases of acute rheumatism that has affected the heart

109
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:54,519
and there are easy arrhythmias.

110
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,890
It's a very interesting symptom.

111
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:14,299
 They feel very uncomfortable with this arrhythmia and then they have to sigh and the arrhythmia

112
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:24,849
goes down for a period of time. A deep sigh which relieves the arrhythmia is Arg-met.

113
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,260
It is very characteristic of Arg-met.

114
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:58,210
 Another characteristic is the jerking on falling asleep. Very strongly, to the extent that they jump

115
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:02,220
they jerk and the hands go like this.

116
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,889
 They wake up. The jerks are very severe jerks.

117
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:23,939
With Zinc, the other person who is with Zinc, who sleep together, they will tell you how they jerk constantly.

118
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:32,959
But they don't wake up. These people they jerk violently and they wake up and then they go back to sleep.

119
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:40,109
The hands go like this as if electricity goes through.

120
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:47,999
The loss of voice it says here it comes from overuse of the voice but it is not the overuse.

121
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:57,069
 It is when there are nodules in the vocal chords, then mostly are indicated.

122
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:13,659
Otherwise the loss of voice from singing, talking is more akin to Arg-n. This is more severe loss of voice, more permanent.

123
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:25,939
And it comes because of some pathology which is there and the pathology is this thickening of the vocal chords

124
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,709
or making nodules in the vocal chords.

125
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:46,789
And we have also one of the most terrible opthalmias, you know blepharitis, when the lids are inflamed

126
00:23:46,790 --> 00:24:03,069
to the extent that are totally closed and full of pus. The little meibomian glands, which are on the margins

127
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:13,979
 are inflamed and they are full of pus, they are swollen and closing the eyes. They cannot see.

128
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:27,699
These cases we don't see so much today because immediately the mothers put disinfectants

129
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:35,700
they put local things and they keep the inflammation on a low level.

130
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:54,719
One case I gave you to study, this case is taken from old journals. You see how they describe? This is typical.

131
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:05,769
It is taken from old journals who they have seen these cases. Today is very seldom that you can see such a case

132
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:21,179
unless there is somebody in a village or people who do not have access so easily to modern medicine.

133
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,330
So the case I gave you is a case of Arg-met.

134
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:35,890
Who prescribed Arg-met.?

135
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,290
Who put it as a second remedy?

136
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:13,169
Also this remedy makes the system quite tired and looking much older than his age, worn out individuals

137
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:20,609
 with these constant pains and deformities.

138
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:40,499
You will need this also when you have an affection on the testes, when the testes are inflammed and swollen

139
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,199
 and especially if it is the right testis.

140
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:57,179
In the book it says, the left ovary, I don't know, maybe.

141
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:18,299
And when you have that pain, the pain is much worse by the clothing touching the testes.

142
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:24,339
This touch of the clothing upon the testes makes it very painful.

143
00:27:38,290 --> 00:28:02,909
This was a case I saw in Berlin, that was diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis in a little child with very deformed knuckles.

144
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,410
Very severe with loss of voice.

145
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:24,679
The child could not speak almost at all and the diagnosis was rheumatoid arthritis.

146
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:30,140
It has been to 2 or 3 children hospitals.

147
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:42,049
 I said, no this case is not rheumatoid arthritis, it is a different syndrome it's much more severe case.

148
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:55,969
 I don't agree at all with the diagnosis. The mother was a medical doctor and unfortunately I had to tell this

149
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:05,410
 in front of her and that the child had very little possibility for a cure.

150
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:21,699
When the mother heard me saying that, that this is rather hereditary genetic disease, it's a new syndrome

151
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:31,529
 I cannot know the syndrome but definitely is a severe case, it's not rheumatoid arthritis.

152
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:51,489
She took the child to another hospital and finally the child diagnosed as a syndrome which is a deficiency in ceramidase.

153
00:29:51,490 --> 00:30:15,609
It is an enzyme which affects the cartilages very much and affects the voice, exactly the symptomatology of the child.

154
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:37,439
The fact remains that these children are only a few cases in the whole world so far recorded and the expectancy of life

155
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,669
 is very short. They die quite soon.

156
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:53,139
What I said as a prognosis it was confirmed exactly. It is very difficult thing, when you say they child

157
00:30:53,140 --> 00:31:01,719
has rheumatoid arthritis. With rheumatoid arthritis the child will not die.

158
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:14,340
When you see rheumatoid arthritis in children, we call it Still disease.

159
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:24,779
It's the name of a doctor who described this rheumatoid arthritis in children.

160
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:40,159
The knee becomes so big, the leg is little and the knee is tremendous but they will not die  they can live quite long.

161
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,399
But with this disease they die very soon.

162
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:56,949
-How are the modalities of arthritis? Because I have a case, Cina, I gave her the wrong remedy but she doesn't have

163
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:04,089
acute arthritis, she has this deforming arthritis with symptoms of Rhus-t. But it never helped.

164
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:13,129
 And eventually she developed nods on her vocal chord and she often says, it is from over straining.

165
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:19,939
So she got operated now and she has the same hoarseness. Can it that be Arg-met.

166
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:32,379
-Yes that's the case. You see if this case now has jerking during sleep, if you ask her specifically, because maybe

167
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:44,929
they will not say and they say yes jerking during sleep, and if there is any affection on the heart

168
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:55,269
with heart irregularities and this heart irregularity is better by sighing, it is absolutely.

169
00:32:55,270 --> 00:33:06,979
Actually they are very tired individuals, worn out. When you say worn out, you see the skin and it is the skin

170
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,889
 of a much older person.

171
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:23,699
I remember a case in Berkley. She could not sit on a chair and give me the case, we had to bring a table

172
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:29,250
 and put her down and she was lying and giving the case.

173
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,789
Arum-t., this is another children's remedy.

174
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:06,269
Arum-t. is one of the remedies you will recognize by looking at the child or the person.

175
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:16,269
Why? Because all the aggressiveness of the disease seems to be around the mouth and the lips.

176
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:26,879
The lips are dry and red and cracked, and peeling off.

177
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:39,239
You have a bronchitis, you have whatever it might be the problem, even colitis but here is affected

178
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:47,480
 the area around the mouth is always affected. And this is how you are guided in this remedy.

179
00:34:48,380 --> 00:35:04,569
 And the desire is of the person, to pick on this membranes as they crack and they become a little bit loose

180
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:13,509
 they usually try to get them out and then it becomes more inflamed and more red and painful.

181
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:19,079
  It's bothering them, they need to pick.

182
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:33,459
It's not a matter just to take it out. No. They pick and the same way children who bore  their fingers into the nose.

183
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:49,439
The bore them into the nose constantly.
That is an indication for Arum-t.

184
00:35:49,440 --> 00:36:02,259
Also the discharge from the nose is quite acrid, burning and that inflames the upper part, even more

185
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:12,369
 and makes a syndrome which is quite obvious for anybody to see.

186
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:19,770
And that's why you see the case, it doesn't matter what he may say.

187
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,809
Irresistible desire to bore fingers.

188
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:47,639
The mental symptoms, I don't know some peculiarity of Arum-t. From grown ups where I have given it

189
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:56,409
 I have not been able. You give it to a case and the person has a character.

190
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:59,540
  You cannot take the characteristics of that person and say, this is it.

191
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:08,559
Because even if you think so, you go to the next case and you don't see the same characteristics. So forget it.

192
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:15,529
If you teach especially, you have
to be careful not to give a misinformation.

193
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:25,320
Because a lot of misinformation is coming today in the teaching of Materia Medica because nobody can really control it.

194
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:45,329
 So if I have a case and I have a character and you show this in her case, her personality, many people

195
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:52,669
 confused it for pathology. It's his/her personality, it's a pathology, they are two different things.

196
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:59,939
The other one we say Tarent. Do you think by Tarent. she will change her personality? No.

197
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,509
She will just lower a bit the music.

198
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:21,629
It's not going to change the personality. The personality or the quarrelsome, she may not be quarrelsome

199
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:32,539
but the tendency when the pathology is there, it will be to jump up and fight.

200
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:46,319
Also she had symptoms of Caust. and Sulph.

201
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:58,869
By the way we came back to your case, so is this a case of Aur-m-n. and then Tarent. and then Sulph.?

202
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:10,979
Is this a case of Aur-m-n. Tarent. and Caust. Is this Aur-m-n., Caust. and then Tarent.?

203
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,079
All these are possibilities, you see?

204
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:28,029
The main thing is that you have a reason for giving this or that remedy. If in your mind you are confused

205
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:33,469
you are thinking different remedy, let's give this one, this is not good.

206
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:42,339
You have to know why you are giving this remedy, why in yourself. You have to have a justification.

207
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:50,180
I'm giving for this and that reason, OK it doesn't work. Then what do I have to do, the next thing.

208
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:51,359
 Then you know what you are doing. Otherwise you just give remedies, one after another

209
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:04,440
 without knowing what is happening, whether the remedy is affecting or not affecting.

210
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:17,149
-I just wanted to know, if you ever saw Arum-t. in Kawasaki syndrome because they've got these lips and the lymph nodes.

211
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:24,720
-I have not seen the exact case but it must be yes. It must be indicated.

212
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:51,349
You may see this case in children's epidemic, where we have scarlet fever in which again the effect on the lips is obvious.

213
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:57,689
Again in this remedy you see the hoarseness from overuse of voice, of changing continually

214
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,549
from deep to hoarse uncontrollably.

215
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:17,469
This remedy will be indicated not in hoarseness from overuse but if there is this change, from one state to the other.

216
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:25,149
This is the characteristic, not the overuse, the hoarseness from overuse.

217
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:32,119
Changing of the tone of voice, from one to the other.

218
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:52,339
This will happen usually in cases of hay fever, allergic conditions that affect the larynx.

219
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:59,179
It's a kind of laryngitis that comes and goes.

220
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:19,199
In the Arg-met. the hoarseness is a steady feature and it is progressively worse and worse feature.

221
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:28,239
So the pathology is different. The underlying pathology is different.

222
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:37,390
 In this course most probably we will not
 be able to see the acute remedies so much

223
00:42:37,391 --> 00:42:40,219
unless there are some children they fall sick etc.

224
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,399
There is a question here, when does one prescribes a complementary remedy, under what circumstances

225
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:59,269
 that complementary qualities make it a consideration rather than same or other remedy?

226
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:14,039
The indications always are the symptoms. And if the symptoms indicate a remedy which in the book it says

227
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:22,459
 is a complementary that is one more confirmation that you can go and give it.

228
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:30,769
In a case of Staph. who develops symptoms of Caust. you say well symptoms of Caust.

229
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:35,709
 I would prefer to give Caust. than give Phos.

230
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:43,079
Because Caust. is complementary to Staph. but according to the symptoms always.

231
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:51,489
It is not a case where you will just go and give a complementary remedy just because it is a complementary remedy.

232
00:43:51,490 --> 00:44:00,669
You never do that. You have the symptoms, you think of this remedy and suddenly you open the book

233
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:10,179
and you read this is a complementary, OK I'll give it. It's one more confirmation.

234
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:20,589
 If it's not a complementary, do we know that
Nit-ac. is a complementary to Nat-m.? No.

235
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:26,029
It doesn't matter. She has Nit-ac. symptomatology, we give it.

236
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:35,099
-I would like to ask about the inimical for instance. It says on Phos. is an inimical to Caust. and Caust.

237
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,509
  is an inimical to Phos. What are we doing with it?

238
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:52,219
-They say inimical because they have similar qualities. To prevent you from prescribing something which

239
00:44:52,220 --> 00:45:01,099
 can be similar, it can be quite close, that means it will disturb the case, they say inimical.

240
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:11,339
What they have observed was that when in a case Phos. was indicated and Caust. was given, what you did

241
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:16,524
was only to aggravate the case.
Because it was very close, the qualities are close.

242
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:34,730
 The constitution, the make up are quite similar and the Caust. and Phos. they differ only in the...

243
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,769
...degree to which they se injustice.

244
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:50,949
Phos. will see injustice and will suffer, OK. Caust.  will attack. Phos.  never.

245
00:45:53,350 --> 00:46:02,389
Both they see suffering, Phos. will immediately run to do something, Caust. no.

246
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:10,979
You have somebody who is sick, he is suffering, it's not so anxious. Phos. is very anxious.

247
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:23,929
-I wanted to do it in practical because sometimes we have this mistake between Phos. and Caust. So if you give

248
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:27,209
 by mistake Caust. can you give Phos. afterwards?

249
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:30,479
-Yes sure.
-That's what I wanted to know.

250
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:45,899
-But if you gave Phos. and is doing well, then you think it is now a case of Caust.  most probably you are making a mistake.

251
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,969
Most probably by giving Caust.  you spoil the case.

252
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:05,389
-But that doesn't apply to all the remedies that are similar. I heard that Nat-m. and Ign. are very similar

253
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:09,089
 but I never heard that they are inimical.

254
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:21,529
-They can be yes. When you have given Nat-m. and it has acted very well and then you go and give Ign.

255
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:28,279
 you may aggravate the case.
Unless Ign. is really indicated.

256
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:38,919
You upset the case and you bring depression again and things like that, you have upset the case.

257
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,969
-I heard that some remedies don't follow well,
like Lyc. doesn't follow well after Sulph.

258
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:06,249
-This is not my experience. If it indicated, if you have symptoms of Lyc. after Sulph., you can give it.

259
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:15,319
It was Kent I think who said you start with Sulph., then you go to Calc. and then to Lyc.

260
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:21,729
So in between Sulph. and Lyc. comes Calc.

261
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:32,639
These are ideas, maybe Kent was not able to explain everything or was not recorded that in order to

262
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,409
  give the sequence you have to have
the symptoms of these remedies.

263
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:47,219
You don't do it mechanically. You start a case with Sulph., then you follow it with Calc., then with Lyc. No.

264
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:56,129
You start with Sulph., the person became cold, still the desire for sweets is there, the cold feet and perspiration

265
00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:00,939
yes, Calc. Still the headaches are there.

266
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:06,839
Then you come to Lyc. where the headache stayed on the right side, the bloatness is there and then

267
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,479
you give it and you complete the picture.

268
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:25,779
Many times he said that these triple-remedies will be indicated in rotation. You go one time and then you start again

269
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:37,710
 Sulph., Calc., Lyc. But this has to be always according to the symptomatology. You don't do it mechanically.
