1
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:29,760
I thought in this seminar just
because you are Germans...

2
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:40,779
...I'll make an exception to the program
 that I usually have.

3
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:56,319
So what I'll give you as a present? I will make
 a differential diagnosis of two remedies.

4
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,890
Alum. and Nux-m.

5
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:20,269
I will point out to the similarities
 and to the differences.

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,740
If you go to our Materia Medicas,
 to our Repertories, you will see

7
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:56,539
a lot of similarities between
 Nux-m. and Alum.

8
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:16,400
Both they have a dryness
of the mucus membranes.

9
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,820
 Both they have severe constipation.

10
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:38,219
 Both they have a mind which
is not functioning properly.

11
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:55,480
So it can be easily interchanged,
one for the other.

12
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:14,619
What I will try to do is to give you the
difference in the personality of the pathology.

13
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,620
Something very interesting.

14
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:40,119
Both, as we said, they have dryness
 of the mucus membranes.

15
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:56,300
But this dryness it gives a different symptomatology from one to the other.

16
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,219
What is this dryness in Alum., let's see first.

17
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:26,380
It is mostly in the skin, especially the back of the palms and especially to the colon, to the guts.

18
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:36,660
There is a dryness on the
 lower digestive system.

19
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,779
Together with an idea of paralysis.

20
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:09,110
When a pure Alum. case tries
to have a stool, it is a battle.

21
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:16,939
The stool cannot come out. The peristalsis,
the natural peristalsis is not there.

22
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:32,429
The stool and the mucus membranes are dry and do not lubricate the guts so the stool can come out.

23
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:40,839
So it is a terrible state of constipation,
the worst possible.

24
00:05:45,980 --> 00:06:04,280
They try, they try, they use mechanical means. but see now the idea of paralysis together with this dryness

25
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:18,070
together with this slowness because the mind becomes slow. The mind does not function.

26
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:31,840
 There is a sense that when they are in the middle of a conversation, there is a sense in them of

27
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:34,978
'what is he saying this person?'.
They cannot perceive.

28
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:50,170
 And they speak and by the time they speak, they hear their own voice and they say, 'it seems to me

29
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:54,089
 somebody else is speaking'.

30
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:04,820
This slowness gives a symptom that
 we perceive while taking the case.

31
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:25,069
The symptom is that the person tries to describe to us what is his problem and -I will exaggerate it a little bit myself-

32
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:42,290
 - you see the frowning of the ... forehead.

33
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,409
 You see how you will perceive it?

34
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,910
This is the effort...

35
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,350
To express. The effort to express.

36
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,390
 It's going to be apparent to you.

37
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:22,799
They try, it's the same like the stool which
cannot come out. The words cannot come out.

38
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:37,049
And you will perceive this very clearly
 because the Alum. is not so much aware

39
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,979
or she will not tell you that
'my mind does not function'.

40
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:54,989
You will see it, it's very obvious but she will not say it and you have to perceive it and ask specific questions.

41
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:02,800
'Do you really feel as if somebody else
 is speaking while you're speaking?'

42
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:17,860
This kind of response you
 will receive from Alum.

43
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:37,380
It is as if the humors of the body are lessened to a great degree and the movement becomes slow

44
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:43,349
the mind is slow, the guts are slow.

45
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:07,700
Together with this slowness it is the idea of paralysis in which we will use Alum. in cases of

46
00:10:07,701 --> 00:10:30,949
M.S., in A.L.S., in different paralysis of the different organs, once constipation is there.

47
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:41,889
Almost always, not always constipation is
coming together with other Alum. symptoms.

48
00:10:49,250 --> 00:11:02,720
For Alum. we have this kind of picture. If you perceive this and you hold it, I say it in a very nutshell

49
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:05,999
 if you hold it, you will not miss it.

50
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:16,739
Now we come to Nux-m. which from the
 books looks very much one like the other.

51
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,660
What is the difference?

52
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:38,300
The prime difference you will see in Nux-m.
 the dryness of the mucus membranes is mostly

53
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:43,300
on the upper digestive, mouth.

54
00:11:47,210 --> 00:12:01,829
There, the dryness appears so strongly
 that the tongue sticks on the palate.

55
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:11,810
They wake up in the night and the tongue is stuck there. They make an effort to detach it.

56
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:31,819
There is also in Nux-m. a constipation, which
is similar but never as strong as the Alum.

57
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:43,830
Also in Nux-m. we may get
many times the opposite, diarrheas.

58
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:57,839
But the dryness in the mouth area and
also, that's a big difference, in the eyes.

59
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:05,380
The eyes become absolutely dry
and they cannot open and close their eyes.

60
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:12,949
They have to put tears in order to
lubricate and open and close the eyes.

61
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:29,600
Therefore it is a dryness which is centered mostly on the upper digestive and also eyes.

62
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:35,649
Where Alum. does not have this.

63
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:53,490
If we go to the mind of Nux-m.
you cannot say it's a slow mind.

64
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,739
It is a mind which is not present.

65
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:15,079
It is like a person who is day dreaming all the time, it's not present, it's not fully there.

66
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:24,229
It's not a matter of cannot find the
words to express, like Alum.

67
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:30,459
Alum. knows what she wants to say
but the word does not come.

68
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:43,040
With Nux-m. you can ask, she can answer and in two minutes she has forgotten she answered you.

69
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:48,889
You see the difference in the quality of the mind?

70
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:58,169
She is not present; she has answered
you but she has forgotten it.

71
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:14,619
She is cooking and somebody rings the bell
and she goes there and starts conversing.

72
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,119
 The food is completely forgotten.

73
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,060
I'll use an expression which I don't know how many people you are familiar but in my books I have mentioned it.

74
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:40,709
She is living a little bit detached
 the vital body from the physical body.

75
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:45,610
A little bit outside of her body.

76
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:58,200
They are living in a state of 'how nice'.

77
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:05,730
You know the state? Maybe later
on I will connect it with Cann-i.

78
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:21,649
But those who take marihuana - I have no experience but from descriptions that people have made to me -

79
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:28,390
they live in a wonderful state of mind.

80
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,649
But they are not present,
 they are not there.

81
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:53,299
Marihuana has this effect upon the body to detach, the physical body from the etheric body

82
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,470
from the mental-emotional body.

83
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:21,870
And when this happens people who have a clear conscience, especially young people who are using marihuana

84
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:30,319
 because I'm not going to use marihuana
 neither any of you, you are grown ups.

85
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:46,999
Because the conscience is clean and clear  when this happens, they go into a state of ecstasy.

86
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
They go into a state which they used
 to call in the 60's the spiritual state etc.

87
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:05,949
You experience the spiritual state of the possibilities we have as humans by taking a little bit of marihuana.

88
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:19,490
That is true but that ecstasy
is not healthy ecstasy.

89
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:25,439
It's a wonderful state of mind like Nux-m.

90
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:36,470
But without purpose, without coherence.

91
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:50,679
 It is like breaking down the human
totality, the human entity which is one.

92
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:58,829
We have to be one in order to function
 in this world. We have to be present.

93
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:10,930
Marihuana will break down this mind, will break down that and will leave us in a wonderful state for

94
00:19:10,931 --> 00:19:21,589
a period of time and then comes the opposite state in which the person will go into depression.

95
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:29,169
And it needs another dose because it remembers what wonderful state it was, let me take another dose.

96
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:39,509
In this way you break down the organisms.
 I'll tell you something which is political.

97
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:57,529
Some politicians claim let's leave marihuana
 free, let's sell it anywhere like cigarettes.

98
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:06,929
I tell you this will be the
 end of the human race.

99
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:18,279
Because what I have seen as the effect of marihuana in young people, sometimes is terrifying.

100
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:31,819
Because it leaves the body outside
 of the physical body all the time.

101
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:38,839
That means they are living in another
 world, in the dream world.

102
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:50,849
This detachment is necessary for us to happen in order to rejuvenate our bodies and it happens naturally in sleep.

103
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:59,190
In sleep you leave your physical body and you get the information you need and in the morning you wake up

104
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:03,139
 and say, it's a new day.

105
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,239
That is a natural regeneration
 of the human body.

106
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:22,109
But if you force the organism to do this by narcotics, by drugs, then you will get definitely the after effect. Finish.

107
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:28,909
You have to know that. Whether you use it or you don't use it, whether your children, patients use it.

108
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:39,279
You have to explain to them this is going to happen. What happens with people using the marihuana.

109
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:49,160
It happens that the mind
loses its critical power.

110
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:57,279
They don't have anymore discrimination. They cannot discriminate, this is right, this is wrong.

111
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,760
Where everybody knows
 this is right, this is wrong.

112
00:22:01,761 --> 00:22:07,329
People who have taken marihuana,
 they have no discrimination.

113
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:14,730
Everything goes. Anything you tell them,
they will swallow it. They will believe it.

114
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:20,049
They are the nice people, love, love.

115
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:31,980
Yes it's nice to love but if that love has
 come as a result of inner, esoteric work

116
00:22:31,981 --> 00:22:39,249
 that has made you from a human
 animal to a real human.

117
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:49,870
That's inner, esoteric work. That means you have taken yourself and put him down and say you made a mistake

118
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:59,280
 here you showed a lot of egoism.
You told lies, you did this and that.

119
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:10,390
And then you improve, you evolve as a human being but to take marihuana to improve, to live in a spiritual state

120
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:19,799
for a moment or two moments or two
years and then you have the after effects.

121
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:24,960
The organism will punish you.

122
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:38,319
The body stays outside and then fear of getting crazy, split, schizophrenia, fear of 'I'm becoming schizophrenic'.

123
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,080
It's a characteristic of Cann-i.

124
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:56,199
You will see the end effect. Fear of insanity in Cann-i. is the worst because it's a panic state which comes

125
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:02,903
almost 20 hours the day for
these people. It's terrible.

126
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:21,259
Nux-m. is not in this state, where they
 get fear or panics. It is in between.

127
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,609
Still it's not gone too far.

128
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:36,769
As I told you before, when the organism
wants to relax, leaves the body and sleeps.

129
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:52,720
In Nux-m. it's exactly this. Because the body
 is already out, you maybe talking to them

130
00:24:52,721 --> 00:25:00,499
and you maybe looking in the Repertory because you search some symptoms they told you

131
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,399
and in front of you the patient is sleeping.

132
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,460
You see how easily they fall in sleep?

133
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:21,610
They try to read... and they go like that.

134
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:30,869
They will sleep at any
time without any problem.

135
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,270
It's not that they want it,
 it just happens to them.

136
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:47,810
You understand how this function of going
 out of the body is already ready to sleep

137
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:51,909
between dream world and real world.

138
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:07,120
That is the state of the mind of Nux-m.

139
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:16,930
Do you realize now that there are a lot of differences in reality when you examine somebody

140
00:26:16,931 --> 00:26:22,499
between Alum. behavior and Nux-m. behavior?

141
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:34,080
If you have understood in depth
 this, you cannot confuse it.

142
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:42,940
But it took me years and years before I understand these things and to be able to sort it out

143
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:48,999
and be able to give it out
verbally, to describe them.

144
00:26:49,000 --> 00:27:00,080
I'm trying to describe something
 which is intangible, which is subtle.

145
00:27:00,081 --> 00:27:10,459
 A state of the mind, its a very
subtle idea, to express it.

146
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:16,029
One has to live it to be able to transfer it.

147
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:25,509
Because if I use simply words, do you think you can differentiate? You will not understand the difference.

148
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:39,620
But now you understand that when you
have this great sleepiness, it's not Alum.

149
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:49,600
Little things but if you have understood,
 you cannot make the mistake.

150
00:27:52,570 --> 00:28:09,979
Alum. has anxiety, tremendous anxiety,
 fears, not Nux-m. Nux-m. is ...

151
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:19,700
But the food she goes back to the kitchen and the food is burned out, she forgot totally

152
00:28:19,701 --> 00:28:25,019
that she has put something on the stove
because she was talking and talking.

153
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,740
Finished, no food today.

154
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,000
Where is my wife?
