1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:59,980
Hyperactivity of the nervous system, especially in feet and brain.

2
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:13,580
Movement of thoughts, movement
of brains and movement of the feet.

3
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,780
The feet cannot stop moving either in bed or while sitting.

4
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:34,180
 So you will recognize these cases by looking in the feet because they cannot control the feet to just be quiet.

5
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:46,380
There is over stimulation and the brain also is over stimulated but not in a way like for instance, Verat.

6
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:58,560
Verat. has some ideas and some thinking or Coff., there is over stimulation.

7
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:09,860
Here the over stimulation is such as to cause a kind of dissatisfaction in the person.

8
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,980
It is the main remedy for complaining and dissatisfaction.

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:38,220
Restlessness appears on the ending of the nervous system causing especially in the face to do facial ticks.

10
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,200
And twichings on all the body.

11
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,170
Full of twichings.

12
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:21,700
And the next characteristic is that the moment they go to sleep, there is an electrical stimulation

13
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,300
of the nervous system, if we can say.

14
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:33,900
The moment they go to sleep, the moment that the mind goes to stop, all this electric charge, which is in the body

15
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,320
 comes in the lower extremities and they jerk.

16
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,240
The lower extremities especially jerk.

17
00:03:50,400 --> 00:04:00,260
 Arg-met. they also jerk but all the body, hands and feet.

18
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,940
These are the main things that you have to have for a Zinc case.

19
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,200
The spine is like being on fire.

20
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,840
You have the same thing in another remedy.

21
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,660
In Pic-ac also you get this burning in the spine.

22
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:12,620
It's a remedy that will have these nervous reactions which may lead from simple twitching to convulsions

23
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:22,740
to epilepsy, after suppression of eruptions or discharges.

24
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:34,750
Usually with Zinc we see in the history a suppressed eruption and then it comes that stimulation

25
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,350
and the stimulation comes in the brain also.

26
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,320
When they think, they have to move the head.

27
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:59,180
They think, they are mathematics, you will see constant movement of the head.

28
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:09,290
They will not talk, they will not express ideas but together with the idea is the movement of the head.

29
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,080
You will see whether they try to control it or not, you will be able to see it.

30
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Women who feel better with the flow. During the flow of the menses, they feel better and worse if the menses are suppressed.

31
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:56,350
You put a question to him and he will repeat first the question and then he will give you the answer.

32
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,620
That is characteristic.

33
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:13,540
Women that they have either scanty menses, where they should have more and dissatisfied in sexual matters.

34
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:23,740
Then they come into a state of constant complaining. Everything is wrong and they have to complain, complain.

35
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:37,700
In the end, nobody wants to be near them because of this sense of dissatisfaction and complaining.

36
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,260
 Poor me, why this happened to me?

37
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:58,060
It's really like Nit-ac. on the level of health. These people do not have anxiety about their health.

38
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:09,520
Nit-ac. will complain about their health. Everything is health. Here is complaining about different things in life.

39
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:25,780
Especially that they are not treated well by others, they are not satisfied with the conditions around them.

40
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,900
Anything they can think about. It's not a matter of real problem. It's a matter of pathology.

41
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:48,670
Also I have seen it in convulsions, epileptic convulsions if they are exposed to the light.

42
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:04,220
Children that they will have a fit from exposure to the sun light, they go into a fit.

43
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:19,060
-Concerning sensitivity to light, is that sensitivity to intermitted light? Like photo sensitivity that is often in epilepsy?

44
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,180
-Not intermitted.
-For instance if you drive a car and there is an alley

45
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,580
with trees and they get intermitted light with flashes.

46
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,660
-No. Maybe it will happen also to that condition but it is light.

47
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:44,940
When from here he goes out into the light, he gets it. Intermitted also it can happen of course.

48
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,210
-I didn't understand very well what you said
 about the spine. The spine is under fire?

49
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,980
-It's a burning feeling in the spine.
-Thank you.

50
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:21,580
-Zinc is one of the elements which the organism needs, most probably to build up the nervous system

51
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:31,420
exceptionally the nervous system. And the nervous system gets unsatisfied, I want more Zinc.

52
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,150
....the nerve endings...

53
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,900
-George, in children if they have measles and the eruption doesn't comes out and they say it's dangerous because

54
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,460
it might go to the brain.  Can you give them Zinc. or do you have to wait until it develops?

55
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:27,100
In order to give Zinc.  you have to have the twichings, some starting of the convulsions or the complaining, the dissatisfaction.

56
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:35,260
-It's not only when the eruptions starts.
-No because Caust. has that and Sulph. has that and a lot of

57
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,460
other remedies have that.

58
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:50,730
-What does the hysteria look like during suppression of urination?

59
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:24,340
-Hysteria with retention or urine. This is one of the strange symptoms. A person who does not urinate

60
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:36,740
 the urine does not come out, then they go into hysteria. But I don't mention these case

61
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:44,220
 just because it's on the third degree and it's alone, we have put it here, as I said.

62
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,980
But who has seen this? You can imagine hysterical reaction.

63
00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:01,260
And there is a suppression of urine, you may be thinking if you just have good memory and you can remember it

64
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:10,590
and you say, that's very good symptom.
 But who will see it, in your whole life?

65
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:21,500
What you will see is what I described to you and when you see it you have to recognize it.

66
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:33,020
This is a remedy which is similar to what remedy?

67
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:57,940
Agar. It's similar to Agar. in the activity of the nervous system, the twichings, the jerkings but Agar. complains

68
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:04,780
 very much about their fear of cancer.

69
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:26,500
This remedy is much more intense than Agar. in the nervous activity.

70
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:42,550
Agar. does not have the restlessness of the feet. Here in the Zinc. almost all the cases you will see an activity of the foot.

71
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,900
 They will sit there and they will do like this all the time.

72
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,500
-Did you say Zinc has no fears?
-No fears.

73
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:05,670
-Because we saw this little child from England once that you presented to us and he had the fear

74
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:10,100
that the world will fall apart.

75
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:21,610
-That is true but the fear did not go away with Zinc.

76
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:38,900
-A little remark. There was an epidemic virus in Germany in 1955 and it was found that all the people were

77
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,780
lying in bed and driving bicycle and this
 whole epidemic was regulated by Zinc.

78
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:56,040
-By Zinc? I don't understand, there
 was a virus epidemic, like influenza...

79
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:09,950
-Yes and all the people who got this virus were lying in bed and driving bicycle and it was regulated by Zinc.

80
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,420
-Yes, it's a good expression.

81
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:25,370
-In every homeopathic book you will see this aggravation by alcohol and especially wine, what happens

82
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:33,580
with them when they are drinking alcohol
and how often are you seeing this symptom?

83
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:44,870
-Not often. It's not one of the symptoms that you want to remember as a picture of Zinc.

84
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:55,820
Ran-b. for instance is sensitive to alcohol, you have to remember that because in headaches it makes them crazy.

85
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,030
Not in Zinc.

86
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:15,160
The problem with our Materia Medica, especially if we continue to add symptoms the problem will be that

87
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,740
 all the remedies will have all the symptoms.

88
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:26,260
And then we finished. We will start all over again.

89
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:33,980
Because the moment that you see in all the remedies all the symptoms, how can you differentiate?

90
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:50,300
So unless you are really able to condense to a few symptoms that give the essential picture, where mostly you see

91
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,910
 you will not be able to differentiate.

92
00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:05,060
 I can tell you if I take all the Zinc. cases and I write them down with all the symptoms they have I will add 200 symptoms.

93
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:12,190
 But then it will be bad because people will say, this symptom is important, that symptom is important.

94
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:20,830
No, these symptoms are not important. What is important are these few symptoms that give you the idea of the remedy.

95
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,240
You don't need more.

96
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:39,600
 Now in the Repertories it happens the same thing. They added symptoms which are not reliable.

97
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:48,330
Adding, adding, adding in the Repertory you will add thousands of symptoms which are not reliable

98
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:55,540
and the repertorization if you take it seriously, it will give you the wrong remedy eventually.

99
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:05,940
If we continue adding in the Repertory uncritically symptoms. This is a big problem and that is why in a meeting

100
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:19,380
 that we had here before these seminars we recognized the need to have the Repertory cleaned up

101
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:25,960
so the symptoms that are in the Repertory they can be reliable.

102
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:40,660
Anyone wants to add in the Repertory. And they do provings and we discussed the last time about the provings

103
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,480
how they are done. Not reliable at all.

104
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:59,580
I told you, there was a group of Italian doctors that they wanted to do a proving; so they asked me

105
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,580
will you send us a substance with which
we can make a proving? I said yes.

106
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:15,380
I telephoned and I said find me the same remedy that Jeremy from England did proving of Hydrogen.

107
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:26,510
Just send me the same thing. And I told them to take and do a proving with Hydrogen. You will not believe.

108
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:38,660
They were the control group and then the verum group and the control group produced 15 symptoms

109
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:49,740
and the verum group produced 17 symptoms. None of these symptoms were similar to 2-3 persons.

110
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:59,240
 One person produced 3, another produced 2 and they had all the symptoms to 17. And all those symptoms to 15.

111
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:07,500
 None of these symptoms we had anything what Jeremy produced in the whole book.

112
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,940
 A whole book of symptoms with one dose of Hydrogen 12C.

113
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,740
He gave it to 10 people and all these people, each one of them produced a host of symptoms.

114
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,660
Now these symptoms you take it and you put it in the Repertory. Forget it.

115
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:38,060
We destroy the science. It's nothing,
 it will be reduced to nothing like entropy.

116
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,640
You know entropy, the idea that everything goes into a standstill.

117
00:21:46,670 --> 00:22:01,670
If we continue to do things like that, in order to impress the Community, then eventually we shall destroy Homeopathy.

118
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,260
This is my prediction.

119
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:18,460
And that's why sometimes when I write I'm a little bit forceful and a little bit caustic.

120
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,930
Unfortunately I feel I have to do it.

121
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:54,430
Am-c. is a remedy that we use seldom.
It's not a remedy that you will use every day.

122
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:10,490
But it's a remedy that you will need especially in people who are suffering with the circulatory system and respiratory system.

123
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:25,060
Heart and lungs are involved with this remedy. This remedy is obese, is weak and it is caustic in its discharges.

124
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:39,980
Acrid discharges in obese people with
respiratory and problems of heart.

125
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:54,460
The palpitation is so easy with these people and they want to faint. And lying down makes the heart feel better.

126
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:12,270
Ferr. will look like this also but lying down makes them feel worse. Ferr. will also have easy palpitation.

127
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:24,420
They will lie down and the palpitation will be worse. Ferr. are obese people, no stamina, feeling of coldness.

128
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:37,470
So you will confuse them many times but there is a big difference. Am-c. needs to rest and is better by rest.

129
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:41,920
Ferr. needs to move slowly about to feel better.

130
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:59,620
Am-c. you will need it in acute pulmonary edema, where the heart is pumping very fast, where dyspnea is coming.

131
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:15,420
Where the person is ready to faint or you feel is ready to go into a comatose state and there is difficulty in breathing.

132
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:25,460
Such people if you can imagine, heart and lung problems, they go to sleep, they sleep in a state of aggravation.

133
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,960
Sleep cannot refresh them.

134
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:48,470
And they will wake up in the morning with heavy heads. And this remedy will be also confused with Calc.

135
00:25:50,170 --> 00:26:01,950
But it's not as cold as Calc. Calc. is cold and is cold in the extremities; this remedy is cold but mostly aggravated by wet.

136
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,040
You will see the flabbiness, you will see the obesity.

137
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:24,460
And they have a face which looks like the cortisone face. Do you know the cortisone face?

138
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:37,020
This white flabbiness and then some redness is there and the dyspnea and the heart is involved.

139
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:47,180
Then the dischargeS are acrid. The menses are acrid, the stool, the urine, the discharge is acrid.

140
00:26:48,280 --> 00:27:02,540
You see the condition is such, they cannot take any exertion. Any exertion will immediately make the heart pump

141
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:09,040
very strongly which will remind you of Calc.

142
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:17,420
Because you see this flabbiness there and you perceive this flabbiness  in the face mostly.

143
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:26,940
The face looks exactly like
 the cortisone face, the victims of cortisone.

144
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:38,540
And with these patients of course, you will
notice that they get into colds very easily.

145
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:47,060
The defense mechanism is low and a
common cold will come and again and again.

146
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:56,830
And you think of Tub. or you think of Psor. because they have this but the appearance of this person

147
00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:06,719
together with the weakness in the heart, weakness in the lungs easy palpitation, exertion palpitation

148
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:17,500
and this puffiness you have to think of this. Especially when the discharges are acrid.

149
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:26,040
They will produce a kind of burning.

150
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:42,009
Another thing which is quite characteristic is diarrhea in the beginning of menses.

151
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:50,239
With the menses there is diarrhea.
 Which are the other remedies we have this?

152
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,590
-Bovista.

153
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:08,319
What is the difference between Calc. and Am-c.?

154
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:24,199
Because they both have flabbiness, obesity, worse wet weather, exertion makes them palpitate.

155
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:28,189
What will be the difference?

156
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:42,639
In these very symptoms. Now you compare these symptoms only. You don't bring desire sweets

157
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:55,989
 of course Calc. desires eggs, desires sweets. Calc. also is perspiring here, I don't bring these differences.

158
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:04,279
I talk about this very symptom. You have this symptom and you have to differentiate between Am-c. and Calc.

159
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:10,319
 What will make you decide one for the other?

160
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,719
-The discharges in Am-c. are different from Calc.

161
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:28,689
-Yes but I don't bring acrid discharges into the picture. I say obesity, flabbiness, palpitation from exertion.

162
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,759
What will be the difference?

163
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,239
-Despair of recovery?
-No. I don't want to bring another symptom.

164
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:54,979
I want with these 3 symptoms to tell me this is Calc. and this is Am-c.

165
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,399
I've told you already the difference.

166
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:22,239
-Calc. in the first stage are vital persons and Am-c. have weakness.

167
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:31,940
-It's more weak and therefore the palpitation will be much more intense. You see Calc. walks like this, nothing will happen.

168
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:48,139
If you climb up these stairs, this is a test for Calc. You climb up these stairs without palpitation, no Calc.

169
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:52,559
Every time there is palpitation, this is Calc.

170
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:59,240
Now Am-c. will have palpitation with the first 5 steps. That's the difference.

171
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:06,039
The difference is in intensity, the heart cannot take it.

172
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:22,679
And the second is the puffiness. Calc. is obese but in the face it is compact. Am-c. is not compact

173
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:33,560
it is pieces of swelled up tissues.

174
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,240
The cortisone face.

175
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:58,049
These are little things where sometimes you mention a remedy and I say, not at all, forget it.

176
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,599
Because of these little things.

177
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:17,929
-Can we also use this remedy in cases of disease from heights? When people start having these palpitations?

178
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,080
-Mountaineers disease.

179
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:37,119
 No, I don't think so. Am-c. will not be able to climb.

180
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,179
You have other remedies which are more akin to this disease.

181
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:12,520
This sentence here expresses it. Constrictions, contractions, congestions are the three words that describe

182
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:18,050
 the essence of Cact.

183
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:36,249
We will need this remedy in cases of
heart problems, heart infarcts, angina...

184
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:50,159
...where we have these feelings of constrictions.

185
00:34:50,160 --> 00:35:01,270
The heart is felt as if it is constricted by
 some wires, by steel hands.

186
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:06,559
And the constrictions can be anywhere.

187
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:22,279
And the feeling is very much but is also really constricted. It's not a feeling, it is also a real constriction.

188
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:36,209
I remember a case where a problem with a woman it was that she could not be entered by the husband.

189
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:39,279
Because of that constriction.

190
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:47,259
And the constriction is such that the husband was feeling it, in the vagina.

191
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,029
It is not an idea, it is a real constriction.

192
00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:06,489
When you have organs which is round like the heart, the constriction is really felt very strongly.

193
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:15,829
And there is this extension and the constriction which is felt in the heart attack they will say

194
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:25,599
 'I have a constricting pain in the left hand'.
 The remedy is Cact. immediately.

195
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:36,839
And the constriction is very strong,
that's why it says, the patient will cry out.

196
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,080
 It is strong constriction.

197
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,319
The constricting pains may be in the vagina, in the uterus, in the abdomen.

198
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,860
And they are connected with menses.

199
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:08,079
 Violent palpitation, worse lying on
 left side at approach of menses.

200
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:21,320
And the sensation of weight in the vertex is rather a congestion which is felt in the vertex.

201
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,869
Somebody was describing this congestion in this class.

202
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:34,159
When we have congestions, there might be epistaxis at the same time.

203
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:42,599
A high blood pressure which brings epistaxis and has any constriction somewhere is a case of Cact.

204
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:53,260
Delusions that the person is racked with wires.

205
00:37:54,120 --> 00:38:00,410
Strong headache and nose bleeding.
The possibility is Cact.

206
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:05,559
Strong high blood pressure and nose bleeding. The possibility is Cact.

207
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:15,400
Congestion in the heart, congestion in the lungs and then it is difficult to lie down.

208
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:20,609
They have to be brought up, sitting with a lot of pillows.

209
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:46,879
There is an anxiety about their health, a fear of death anxiety to the point of becoming hypochondriacal.

210
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:58,500
Angina cases with a lot of hypochondriacal symptoms.

211
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:09,319
 I'm dying, together with some constriction, the remedy is Cact.

212
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:16,930
Dear George please would it be possible to make a differential diagnosis?

213
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:32,099
-Yes I wish the same. Sometimes we can think about Bell. because there is this congestion

214
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:39,799
 there is a lot of palpitation, even when
 they have headaches there is palpitation.

215
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:47,139
But what I wish to ask you is about the intensity of the symptoms because Bell. is really very very strong.

216
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:54,439
How can we differentiate when we have these symptoms which are almost the same?

217
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,040
When there is no constriction.

218
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:22,639
-The Bell. palpitation comes not so much from heart problems. Here we have a heart remedy.

219
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:39,529
So we go away from Bell.  Bell. will have this pumping mostly with the headaches and with inflammations in general.

220
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:48,079
Inflammation, that means fever. In this remedy we will not see so much the fever activity.

221
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:56,169
We will see mostly the weakness of the heart or the action of the heart.

222
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:12,159
So if you are treating a case with headaches, unless you have congested head, it feels really congested

223
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:19,039
 especially the vertex.
Bell. will be here, activity.

224
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:30,839
Usually they have the frontal sinuses inflamed, especially the right side and then the headache is here.

225
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:42,509
With this congestion the head feels congested. The congestion is felt on top. You have this differentiation.

226
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:56,649
Then the bleeding of the nose is not so frequent with Bell.

227
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:07,209
If the patient will tell you, I have these congestive headaches with easy bleeding, your mind should go more to Cact. than Bell.

228
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,120
We have other remedies also that congest locally.

229
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,700
One of the remedies we mention in this course...

230
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:33,120
...is Amyl Nitrate, local congestions.

231
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:57,719
-Another differential diagnosis might be Lat-m for acute myocardium.

232
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:10,490
- Lat-m. has the typical heart pain with the extension that goes like this, down.

233
00:43:10,491 --> 00:43:25,159
Lat-m. you will use in typical heart infarcts when the pain extents to the left hand or to the back or both.

234
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,519
 Here, in heart infarct you need the constriction.

235
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:38,579
If you have the constriction, as squeezed really, it's very strong that symptom.

236
00:43:48,220 --> 00:44:03,199
The best for us would be to be able to have all the possible modifications of diseases in remedies

237
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:12,599
and each individual characteristic, the main characteristic to find it in the remedy.

238
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:26,519
We are battling today with similar remedies many times because we cannot get exactly the individualized remedy

239
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:38,119
that this person needs. And so we make concessions. OK I take this or that or instead of this, take that.

240
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,519
Instead of Sep., you give Lil-t., instead of Lil-t., you give Sep.

241
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:50,820
Because both they have (similar) and the effect is there but maybe we don't have the exact.
