1
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:38,100
When a case is a case of Aesc.?

2
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:50,429
Is this from Germany? Yes. Very good quality.

3
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:17,399
It is  very difficult, you see this and then you try to make the signature. What signature can you make out of that?

4
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:36,439
Sometimes there is a possibility to connect the one with the other but do not make the mistake of trying to find

5
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:43,349
in every plant or in every animal substance the signature.

6
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:54,479
That means connect qualities of the plant with qualities of the mental or emotional picture of the patient.

7
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:06,119
So with Aesc., what is the main issue here? Where we see the patient?

8
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:13,839
What we have to perceive in order to say this is a case of Aesc.

9
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:24,759
And out of the keynotes that are given here what do we discover?

10
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:41,599
That we have two characteristics mainly. If you look at the symptomatology, there are two characteristics.

11
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:50,430
One is the venous congestion.

12
00:02:51,960 --> 00:03:01,759
A kind of stasis, a kind of heaviness.

13
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:16,369
This heaviness stays upon the mental picture where the concentration is really very difficult.

14
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:34,419
Where the venous system is affected so as to produce mainly congestions and primarily hemorrhoids.

15
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:47,429
But now a lot of medicines are producing hemorrhoids. What is the specialty of this remedy? What it does?

16
00:03:48,940 --> 00:04:06,329
It has severe protruding, like grapes, hemorrhoids. They are painful but at the same time, this pain has

17
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:18,720
a repercussion on the sacral area of the patient.

18
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:32,490
And especially the junctions on the sacral area.

19
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:46,970
 Therefore it will be an individual who will be suffering all along with severe hemorrhoids which are protruding during stool.

20
00:04:50,490 --> 00:05:03,999
And at the same time it will be an individual who will be suffering a lot with his sacral area. The sacral area will be very painful.

21
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:30,659
Especially sacroiliac junctions. And the main problem with Aesc.  will be the inability to stoop.

22
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:42,139
There is no way that they can be stooping. It is absolutely impossible. Bending forward.

23
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:58,629
It is a remedy that will produce a mental and emotional heaviness. The depression on Aesc.  is not very severe

24
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:14,820
but it is a depression that comes with a dullness of mind and a dullness of psychic, of emotions. They don't feel alive.

25
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:28,330
 They stagnate, the emotions stagnate, the mind stagnates and it is not alive.

26
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,599
It says confusion of mind on waking.

27
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:50,359
Why do we have that? Because of the stasis in the venous circulation. They lie down for hours and then there is a stagnation.

28
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,439
They wake up and they feel confused and dull.

29
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:13,959
But is this enough to prescribe Aesc.? No. What you have to have is to have the hemorrhoids, the sacral affection.

30
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:25,289
If you see sacrum affected a lot, immediately the question I have to put is, 'do you have hemorrhoids?'

31
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:35,359
'Yes, external hemorrhoids. I have to push them in. Every time there is a stool, I have to push back the hemorrhoids'.

32
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:45,419
And you will see the whole organism is rejuvenated. 'Now my mind is clear'.

33
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:57,349
They don't understand because they have lived in that situation. They will not tell you 'my emotions are low'

34
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:05,420
once you give the remedy and they feel back again the health, then they start describing what we see here.

35
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:19,879
It says morose, frightful, ill humored, peevish all these are descriptions, only words to indicate that kind of

36
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,360
emotional dissatisfaction which is there with Aesc.

37
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:42,129
So stooping and another difficult position is walking.  Stooping impossible.

38
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:57,569
And the pain, when you will ask them to point to the place, they point exactly to the sacroiliac junctions.

39
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,959
Where is the pain? They point out to the sacroiliac junction, that is most probably an Aesc.  case.

40
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:16,199
You ask about the hemorrhoids, yes. You ask about the morning waking, the difficult concentration

41
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,590
and you will get all the rest of the story.

42
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:35,839
Of course such individuals where walking is painful, stooping is painful, would like to lie down.

43
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:54,489
Knife like pains which shoot up in the rectum. And you have this slowing down of all the different functions.

44
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:11,039
The heart is working, laboring, the stomach is not performing properly. You see that slowing down action on the whole organism.

45
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:31,229
Where veins are engorged or affected, in any part of the body. Whether it is laryngeal veins or whether it is veins

46
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:42,169
in the eyes where there is a distention, a fullness in the veins, the idea should go to Aesc.

47
00:10:46,320 --> 00:11:01,559
You don't give Aesc.  when you see a keynote of Aesc.   You don't go and give Aesc.   especially when you treat a chronic case.

48
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:15,259
You have to perceive that this is really an Aesc.  case, not because there is a keynote of Aesc.

49
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:29,720
Is there this heaviness, the stasis, this engorgement, this dullness? Then the effect is fantastic.

50
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:41,879
 You get a person who has hemorrhoids, external who are pushing every day but he is vital, his mind is working fast

51
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:52,079
 his emotions OK, wait a moment, this is not Aesc. You have to have this heaviness.

52
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:03,019
Also the veins are having this bluish, of course all the veins have this purple color.

53
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:27,999
What I found out with the medicine, is that a lot of human emotions are because of chemistry. Not because of the character.

54
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:44,769
And yet as a society we accuse such individuals. Ah, he is very irritable. He cannot hold it because the chemistry is such

55
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:56,509
 that means the imbalance in the organism is such that he cannot hold it back, he cannot control it.

56
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:11,039
But you go to religion or religious groups where they teach discipline or even in the families, especially the

57
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:19,703
German families or the Norwegian families, the northern countries in general. They teach the children how

58
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:37,319
to control their emotions. That is not a very good practice because the parents should be educated to understand

59
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:47,049
 what is pathology and what is bad character. And when it's pathology they should take the child to a homeopath.

60
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:54,579
 Then the child is not abusive anymore
the child is not so destructive anymore.

61
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:06,989
This is a bad child who wants to destruct everything and things like that. You give a Tub. and the child becomes an angel.

62
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:23,249
You get a woman who is so cutting and abusive and hitting, especially the husband gets it and you give Sepia

63
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:29,199
she becomes such a nice person. You see she changes totally. He says 'what a nice person you are.'

64
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:42,359
The husband says, 'you are such a nice person'. This is the reality, this is the real her apart from pathology.

65
00:14:52,350 --> 00:15:09,709
Let's the weather is stormy and there is this pain and this is impossible, to do this, they go like this and at that moment

66
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:16,049
you come and you say something to them to irritate and then they become very abusive.

67
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,799
But you take the context out of which they become abusive.

68
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:41,309
Also Aesc. has a great characteristic the same as Merc.

69
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,839
Metallic taste in the mouth.

70
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:16,879
In this course we have to speak about smaller remedies because we finished most of the main remedies.

71
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:27,070
We can go to the next remedy which is Aml-n.

72
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:33,220
You read this remedy, how you recognize that remedy?

73
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:43,300
Explosions of heat.

74
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:54,609
This peculiar, explosions of heat on the upper part of the body, almost never in the whole body.

75
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:05,239
You get flushes of heat during the climacteric period. These flushes are generalized flushes of heat.

76
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:19,849
With Aml-n.  if there are generalized flushes, go away. But if they say, the flush becomes in the face

77
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:29,279
sudden and intense, that immediately should put your mind into Aml-n.

78
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:52,249
Anxiety, something will happen <i>now</i>, like a flush. Something bad is going to happen now.

79
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:10,469
 This idea of flushing of an anxiety with its sequence. Something bad is happening at this moment.

80
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:22,799
These flushes of heat are extremely strong, intense

81
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:39,916
and therefore the woman especially, because this is a woman's remedy mostly, she will seek out fresh air.

82
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,240
Therefore you will confuse it with which remedy?

83
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:03,590
Flushes of heat, desire for fresh air, she has to come out.

84
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:27,319
Puls. but the whole class has to say Puls. That means I'm not a good teacher.

85
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:42,879
If I did not make you understand that Puls. is hot, nevermind the sudden. Sudden is a new element that may come

86
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:55,159
but flushes of heat and then she has to have fresh air, is Puls.

87
00:19:55,259 --> 00:20:04,752
The whole organism, goes to the window, she has to go out, air. That's Puls.

88
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:15,059
Aml-n. has explosion of flushing and then air.

89
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:29,199
What I want to draw your attention to is the explosion, the intensity and then it is the face. You touch here is cold

90
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,949
 you touch here is very hot.

91
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:41,719
You have flushes, they say it's only here. You touch here is cold, you touch here is cold, here is very hot.

92
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:49,679
The ears flushes. You touch here hot, you touch there cold.

93
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,119
That is Aml-n.

94
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:08,029
And there is of course something else which is intense and profound yawning which does not satisfy.

95
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:29,449
Yawning and stretching which does not satisfy, you will find in neuromuscular diseases.

96
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:50,239
You may have a case of M.S. with this dissatisfying yawning, with this stretching which cannot stretch really.

97
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:57,839
It stretches but does not satisfy, it doesn't release the tension of the nerves.

98
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:14,569
Plus some flushes which are local, then it doesn't matter if it is myopathy, myastheny, A.L.S., M.S., it does not matter

99
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,319
this is a case of Aml-n.

100
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:32,810
There are other remedies where we have this dissatisfaction and yawning and it is indicated in M.S. Which is this remedy?

101
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,050
Lathyrus.

102
00:22:52,310 --> 00:23:02,989
This remedy also has that but does not have the flushing, does not have this heat production in certain areas.

103
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:13,869
Explosive production of anxiety. Like a flush.

104
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,200
And then it subsides.

105
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,680
This anxiety what it reminds you? Which remedy?

106
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:37,129
Anxiety, something bad is going to happen, not fear, not fear of death.

107
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:54,109
I don't say sudden fear of death, what reminds you? I say anxiety that something bad is coming. I don't know, I can't describe.

108
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:14,349
Phos.  this indescribable anxiety. 'What are you afraid of?', 'I don't know but it is so strong'.

109
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:26,449
It is the same with Aml-n. but in Phos.  keeps there almost all the time, only when he speaks

110
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:33,699
his mind goes out and he is back again, the anxiety comes.

111
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:40,440
With Aml-n. is a flush of anxiety.

112
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:52,329
And with this anxiety, there is restlessness. He cannot sit in one place.

113
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:13,719
You have another symptom that shows the effect of Aml-n. on the nervous system, which is convulsions immediately after delivery.

114
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:22,639
The woman gives birth and then goes into convulsions. That is the remedy.

115
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:31,859
You get an angina case

116
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:42,079
with pain, with local flushing and with constant stretching and he cannot keep still.

117
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,339
You say, keep still, don't move. Impossible.

118
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:59,440
This remedy will be confused in flushes with which remedy?

119
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,760
Glon. Also with Bell.

120
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:20,649
Also Bell. can have these sudden explosive flushes but here the quality of the flushes is that

121
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:24,829
you touch the other area, it is cold.

122
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:43,259
While the flushing area is so hot, the other areas are very cold. Around the Bell. has what? It has flushes in the head

123
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:50,769
or in the body where the extremities are cold. Do you see the difference?

124
00:26:50,770 --> 00:27:02,439
 And then you make prescriptions and he says, my God how he did it? If you know these little things, you just touch

125
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:15,279
you say take this remedy. In a case of angina, you may see fantastic effects. In angina cases where you will find the remedy

126
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:26,629
 and there is not really blockage of a major artery, you may find, the whole issue is resolved.

127
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:43,269
Yes, when the heart is involved.

128
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:53,640
 Also it has another characteristic which is like Bell., pain in the ears with throbbing.

129
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,770
Where you give first Belladonna, it does not act. Aml-n.

130
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:16,810
If it throbbing with pain in the ears, the pain in the ear is synchronized with the pulsation of the heart.

131
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,199
Then is Belladonna or Aml-n.

132
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:34,429
Of course you may expect also that in case there are such local flushes, you may sometimes see faintness.

133
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:52,919
With anxiety, when these flushes of anxiety, something is going to happen, in a case of heart involvement, you may see fainting.

134
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:08,009
In general you may see these sudden flushes of anxiety when there is a disturbance in the circulation.

135
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:22,509
During the menopause you may see these flushes or during a bleeding. You have bleedings and at the same time

136
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,839
you have these flushes of anxiety and the faintness.

137
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:37,600
Immediately your mind will go first to Phos.

138
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:51,759
Phos. of course has to have the thirst, the burning feel inside.

139
00:29:51,760 --> 00:30:02,999
But in case you don't have that, what will differentiate Phos. from Aml-n.?

140
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:18,280
 There is bleeding there is this anxiety, there is a fainting feeling what will make you give Phos. and not Aml-n.?

141
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:30,373
-If the anxiety is constant or by flushes?

142
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:36,519
-If the anxiety comes in flushes.

143
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,920
-If the anxiety is sudden.

144
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:51,639
The anxiety of Phos. is a floating anxiety which goes on. It comes and goes like flushes.

145
00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:06,139
When a woman has flushes, you understand how she feels? There is for a moment great heat and then subsides.

146
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:17,759
In the same way the anxiety in Aml-n. comes which is similar with Phos., similar with Caust. but then subsides.

147
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,039
  No anxiety.

148
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:26,049
And then next time there is a flush, then the anxiety comes.

149
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,769
-Are always the flushes with the anxiety?

150
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:43,039
-No but when you have that symptom. What we discuss here is the essentials of the remedy. If you see that

151
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,299
 your mind should go there. This is what we're teaching. There are so many modifications and modalities but this

152
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:58,030
  we do not concern. We concern in case you have that symptom how you differentiate between one and the other.

153
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:22,650
- In the keynotes what is the difference between intensity and degree?

154
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:37,669
The other remedy Aml-n. had keynotes underneath. And there are two columns in the back, saying intensity and degree.

155
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:56,120
-The first column it says value is, first is lowest value, two is italics, three is bold. This is the first column, it says value.

156
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:05,380
If it is bold, it is three. If it is italics, is in two.

157
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:23,719
The size of the rubric means that if it is 1-1 or 2-1 or 3-1 it means that on the whole Materia Medica is the only remedy that has that.

158
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:32,969
There are no other remedies. If here it says 2 or 3, there are 2 or 3 other remedies which have that symptom.

159
00:33:48,800 --> 00:34:02,089
The symptoms which are given as keynotes, you don't have to remember. You hear it but you can forget it

160
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:08,961
because if you have that symptom, you go to the Repertory you will see it's the only remedy. OK, you can forget this.

161
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:19,299
What is important for you is to perceive the structure of the remedy. What the remedy is doing.

162
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:27,049
That is important, that you have to remember. And connect it in your memory with some other remedies

163
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:39,799
 that you have learned already. Aml-n., Glon., Bell., Phos. anxiety.

164
00:34:40,890 --> 00:34:53,009
If you can do that, then you have a lot in your mind. If you try to remember the keynotes, you will have a problem

165
00:34:53,010 --> 00:35:00,749
because you overload your head with unnecessary information, which you can find in the Repertory straight away.

166
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:06,579
-What is the difference between Glon. and Aml-n.

167
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:24,180
-You have to answer actually because we have done Glon.

168
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:43,529
If you go to Glon. you will see that Glon. say, 'I cannot have sun at all'. Sun is the great enemy for Glon.

169
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:54,899
 Here we don't see in Aml-n. inspite of the flushes, we don't see this great peculiarity.

170
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:05,999
Then Glon. we talked about in headaches. It's purely a remedy which affects the vascular system

171
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,280
causing tremendous headaches.

172
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:22,889
We don't see with Aml-n. so much headaches. We may see some effect on the mind and the effect is anxiety.

173
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:29,399
On Glon. we see the effect and the effect is like Aesc.

174
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:43,729
Both these remedies they may be driving in a place and suddenly they don't recognize, where am I?

175
00:36:51,150 --> 00:37:01,630
And then flashes back the picture. Both Aesc. and Glon. have this.

176
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:13,850
 Aml-n. has flushing anxiety. It's different.

177
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:22,359
-The point that you made before about not having to memorize the keynotes as much as getting the structure

178
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:31,108
 of the remedy, if I wanted to differentiate in a case of Aml-n., the keynotes from the structure what would you call,

179
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:36,850
you gave us certain keynotes, how would I think about the structure?

180
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:56,009
-The structure is the sudden flushes, the sudden anxiety, the desire for open air, that is the whole structure.

181
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:04,540
 It means that the effect is mostly on the vascular system and then on the nervous system.

182
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:19,959
The structure is that the flushes concern an area,  localized flushes. That is structure.

183
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:30,540
Then you have a keynote here which is whatever, you don't have to remember.

184
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:12,849
What you see here, you have the information from the Materia Medica, what is the predominant?

185
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,649
 What impresses you in this remedy?

186
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:34,309
The idea is also that you learn to think. I'm not going to think for you all the time because if you are in private practice

187
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:39,809
 then you have to have learned the way to look at the Materia Medica.

188
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:48,319
So what impresses you in these symptoms? It's written there.

189
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:06,309
Just read and think. And see whether we agree in our evaluation.

190
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,010
-All the blackness.
-Correct.

191
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,249
 All this blackness, black discharges, black boils, black, black.

192
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:32,640
 It says also as if a black boil, silent suffering....

193
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:50,810
Silent suffering. Anthrax, you know how painful it might be and black and discharging black fluid.

194
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,769
 Imagine this in the emotional.

195
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:10,779
Some people who have been really hurt and keep inside this black boil. We describe it as black boil

196
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:19,529
but actually try to imagine how such a person is.

197
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:37,449
It's a boil, it doesn't break out. It is inside and it is black, it is the emotions that are really very painful but hidden inside.

198
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,199
How a person will look like?

199
00:41:44,250 --> 00:42:01,189
It will look like as if it has gone through a lot of pain silently and it says premature old age.

200
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:07,719
This is the result of that suffering without crying.

201
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:24,719
I've given once this remedy to a person. She cried for several days, cried, nonstop as if she never cried before.

202
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:47,479
If you see the video after the lecture, you may recognize the remedy. You see how tired and given up. The pain is inside.

203
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,060
You think life has gone.

204
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:04,459
Feels the death is approaching. But here is not a fear of death.

205
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:25,689
It is 'well, death is coming, I'm dying', it is a realization. It is not a fear, it's not an anxiety. The suffering is so much

206
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:31,760
who cares if he lives or dies? That is the situation.

207
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:44,679
 And of course such persons how do they feel about having sex? You get a married woman. Forget it.

208
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:53,790
It is not exactly aversion to sex. It is no energy for that function.

209
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:07,629
They can work but like robots. Do this, do that, they go exhausted, they lie down, they try to recuperate.

210
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:15,199
 Their skin has become really old.

211
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:25,359
In a very young age. 35,36 and the skin is like a woman of 65.

212
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:43,109
It's very interesting also that you will notice in such cases that, you ask this person 'have you gone through some suffering?'

213
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:52,559
You can see it obviously, there is no question about that. A lot of suffering. She will try to remember.

214
00:44:54,910 --> 00:45:02,419
She will not remember an incident in which she really felt very bad.

215
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:15,559
It has gone inside, closed in a boil like this and kept inside there.

216
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:31,089
If the boil breaks out, then there is a release of the emotions, feeling better. If the boil stays like this, she will keep

217
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:39,319
 she will say 'I don't remember'. Nothing can break this boil.

218
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:55,809
Her life is a torture, is a turmoil, is terrible, yet she will not remember a specific incident to relate to you.

219
00:45:55,810 --> 00:46:02,039
I lost my husband and therefore, I lost and therefore, I do this and therefore.

220
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:09,200
 This is enclosed and kept inside and can't remember.

221
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:25,059
Of course this remedy will be required, will be indicated in cases you have repeated boils especially

222
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:28,729
 if the discharge is dark.

223
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:41,279
It's very interesting also that such persons will like to stay in the house. They don't like to go outside of the house.

224
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,759
 It's not a case of claustrophobia so much as they feel more comfortable in the house.

225
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:53,049
Once they go out from the house, they feel uncomfortable and unstable.

226
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:02,799
That means they need the protection of the house.

227
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:28,639
A keynote is coldness in the abdomen, which goes down the legs. Coldness in legs and back when dressing.

228
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:36,119
That means after certain motions, coldness in legs and back.

229
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:58,949
This coldness indicates the local coldness. It's a reflection of the inside coldness which this person feels.

230
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:21,799
You look such remedies as Sep., as Arg-n.,
as Sec., which look prematurely old.

231
00:48:27,690 --> 00:48:36,679
And the pain intense and burning with all these boils.

232
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:59,539
So you may have a boil wherever in the body. It may open, discharges, closes and during the period it discharges

233
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:08,009
 the boil, the general symptoms are better. She feels a little bit better. Then closes, then she feels bad again.

234
00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:20,169
 Then for years she may have boils which are opening and closing with burning pains, very painful.

235
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:33,289
Tarent-c. and Anthraci. and Ars. have severe burning pain in boils.

236
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:49,609
-How do you differentiate this premature age, this internal grief? It sounds also like Nat-m. in many ways, so what's the distinction?

237
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:13,839
-This person has given up life, it's exhausted mentally and emotionally. Will not give out any signs of life.

238
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:18,450
Nat-m. has nothing to do. Nat-m. will be closed.

239
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:31,799
'You have suffered?', 'Well,...', he knows very well from where it started what he has suffered.  It's different picture all together.

240
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:41,979
 Nat-m. will never have this old appearance.

241
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:57,039
 -What I'm going the sense of is, I see the silent suffering, I see the coldness, I see the darkness,  the closing down,

242
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:03,839
would you find this remedy with some sexual abuse? Where the child was not allowed to tell the parents

243
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,109
or felt there was no way to go with it?

244
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:10,480
-Absolutely yes.

245
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:19,159
And then keeping all this grief inside. The child has been abused, has been abused by the parents

246
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:29,759
by the husband. Then there is a series of abuses and then she cannot remember anymore.

247
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:39,540
She says, well, maybe. You get a response like this.

248
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:46,729
 But what you have in front of you is a terrific suffering of a human being.

249
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,990
You cannot remember anything?

250
00:51:54,130 --> 00:52:01,960
 I mean I was not able to elicit response and to tell me, after that I became like this.
