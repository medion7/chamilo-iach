1
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:36,469
If you look on the notes, what do you have to remember about Bov.?

2
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,720
It's written with big letters.

3
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:59,539
Especially for women, diarrhea before or during menses. This is characteristic.

4
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:08,519
The other you have to remember is awkwardness and the third you have to remember

5
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:21,039
is a kind of peculiar anxiety. I will describe the mental-emotional state of Bov.

6
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:42,909
It says awkward but this awkwardness comes from a state of anxiety and a state of inner hurriedness...

7
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:56,639
and a state like manic depression.

8
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:10,449
The first time I met this, I could not make heads or tails. There was a woman sitting there and she was saying...

9
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:16,189
 'Dear Mr. Vithoulkas I'm suffering so much!'.

10
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:24,320
I was there and she was looking there, she was not looking at me.

11
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,840
 Pouring out all the information.

12
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:56,139
She was not there, she was not composed. She was in a state of anxiety, mania. And in that state when you have

13
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:07,839
 this awkwardness together with that, you have
 a feeling that everything is exaggerated.

14
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,599
In the book it says 'enlarged sensation'.

15
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:24,839
That means you may feel bigger. The fact is that you get the feeling that whatever she feels is too big and...

16
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,709
 too strong to contain within herself.

17
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:46,209
Bov. is one of the remedies that has a lot of skin eruptions and sometimes terrible skin eruption with excessive itching.

18
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:59,699
Which looks like Rhus-t., looks like Anac., like Crot-t. but with tremendous itching.

19
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:13,669
 It's neuro-dermatitis of a type...diffused neurodermatitis in the whole body.

20
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,759
Here it is not mentioned at all, it doesn't matter.

21
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:54,439
I remember in Athens in '76, I presented a case to the Congress there and they were the famous Pasquero

22
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:14,409
very famous doctor from Argentina, Ortega, a famous doctor from Mexico, it was from India, Chand was there.

23
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:20,170
We presented a case of skin eruption.

24
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,659
Again like the other case I told you about Plb., you remember the case I described, this was a woman

25
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,819
of that type, with skin eruption.

26
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,390
I don't know how the 3 of them prescribed Sepia.

27
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:53,839
I saw this case of Bov. Awkward. She says, 'oh my God, I drop everything, I break everything!'.

28
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:05,389
They go to wash the dishes and every 3 months she has to buy a new set because the set is gone

29
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:18,509
 then she needs another one. Apis, Nat-m., Bov. are very awkward persons together with the anxiety

30
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:25,720
 you feel they do something but the mind is not there. Is not in what they are doing.

31
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:37,679
The mind is always in a state of anxiety for no specific reason. I have not been able to say, they have financial problems

32
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,310
 or they have anxiety about health problems.

33
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,880
 It is a super anxiety.

34
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:04,379
 I remember the first time I met this, the medical doctor who was taking the case called me and said, come there is a case there.

35
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:16,440
He was overwhelmed himself.
She said, 'Oh Mr.Vithoulkas! I suffer so much!'

36
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:34,439
You sit back to disconnect and to be able to think, now what is this case? And I don't remember

37
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:43,629
how my mind went to Bov. and I asked
about the dropping of things and she says,

38
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:51,329
'I break things and we are poor, we don't have enough money and I break so many things'.

39
00:07:51,330 --> 00:08:02,430
Then I said, what about menses and diarrhea before? 'Oh yes, every time!'.

40
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:17,519
And then scratching. 'I can't live anymore, I can't stand it.'

41
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:25,119
That type. If you have this, this is a Bov. case.

42
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:38,269
A case like that was presented in '76, he says Sepia, Sepia, if one says one remedy then all the other agree.

43
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:54,819
Shall I take Sepia? Yes, yes take Sepia for a few months before. I was sure Sepia would do nothing.

44
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:10,099
Because you always think with Homeopathy, I may be doing a mistake, I maybe miscalculating, I maybe misjudging.

45
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,519
The symptoms are so subjective.

46
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:31,619
You don't see a boil there, 5 cm black, oozing black stuff. You see it is the soul who is oozing, all this pain

47
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,609
the blackness, what is the remedy?

48
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,089
-Anthracinum.
-Yes, very good.

49
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:51,529
Then this is exuding, this anxiety state.

50
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:11,799
It says, enlarged feeling, the head feels enlarged or the heart feels enlarged, the whole body feels enlarged

51
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:19,639
but the idea of enlarge is within the context of what I described to you.

52
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:32,659
If somebody says, I have a feeling that sometimes my head is big, this is not Bov.

53
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:41,739
This can be Kali-ars. or other remedies but not Bov. Bov. will not tell you like this.

54
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:58,449
My head! .... It's different. 'I feel my head is enlarged'. No Bov.

55
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:07,879
It says I cannot wear a tight. This enlargement, this feeling of expansion.

56
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,920
It is a sub-manic state, I would call it.

57
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:30,769
And they cannot have tight clothes and they speak a lot and you think of Lach.

58
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:45,809
But you see this over exciting about this kind of things and then 'can you have tight clothes around your breast?' No.

59
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:53,239
Actually they will come with very loose clothes.

60
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:04,989
You know the modern collant is not for Bov. and is not for Lach.

61
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:12,649
They'll say 'I feel very comfortable with loose clothes'.

62
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:20,719
Perspiration smells like onion, it is a little symptom that you may be confirming.

63
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:34,979
It says, as a strange symptom, numbness on the posterior part of tongue.

64
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:47,159
These kinds of strange symptoms you may get differently, she may not say about the tongue; she may say it

65
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,149
about the root of the nose.

66
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:07,729
With all this state of anxiety, all this state of excitement and anxiety, put them together and then you will have this.

67
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:41,689
Bapt. is a remedy that I think Margit is able first hand to describe it because she was on the hospital

68
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:49,709
 in Germany and she was lying there in a state.

69
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:59,610
She called me on the telephone and I said, take Bapt.

70
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:24,760
-I got into a state of very high fever, with a terrible diarrhea, I never experienced anything like this...

71
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:38,159
and you cannot imagine the offensive smell of this diarrhea.  It was horrible!

72
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:48,319
I got into a really strange state, I thought am I really here, am I there?

73
00:14:50,280 --> 00:15:03,039
 Then I was brought to the hospital and they gave me Ph-ac. and it didn't work.

74
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:13,959
They sent the stool to the laboratory and then I called you, you asked 3 questions and you said, take Bapt. 10M.

75
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:30,259
Then I got well very soon. Next day the stool was examined and it was typhoid fever and the whole hospital

76
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:36,869
was a homeopathic hospital and they said how did he know? How did he know, he doesn't even have access here?

77
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:50,719
But after this, for 4 weeks I was in the strangest state. I felt like I was the earth, the whole planet and everything

78
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,239
 which was not right, hurt me, like every street, every car.

79
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:03,069
I got in such a sensitive state, I was not much myself anymore, strange state really.

80
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,719
-What was the 3 questions?

81
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:16,249
-You asked, are you exhaustive, is the stool offensive and another question about the stool, if it is watery?

82
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:23,479
But I think the clue was exhaustion because
Ph-ac. is not exhausted with diarrhea.

83
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:34,229
It was really a state that you don't know who you are, if you are somebody else. It's very difficult.

84
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:41,320
I did not have this feeling that I was parted but I had the feeling that...

85
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:54,919
 my soul went away and stood opposite for me and it was very hard on me, it told me all kind of things.

86
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:02,589
-Your soul?
-It was outside of myself. I had this double feeling.

87
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:10,909
The soul told me why do you get in such situations, it was outside of myself.

88
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:36,199
- Margite telephoned and said, 'I have a very high fever and I have diarrhea and I'm exhausted'.

89
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:54,999
Most probably she described that state in which she was and I felt this kind of fever, has brought about a state

90
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,850
 in which you are not anymore present.
You are in a kind of a delusional state.

91
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:12,039
 Once you have a high fever with offensive diarrhea, I asked the diarrhea is offensive?

92
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:17,439
She says, 'very offensive!',
I said, OK thank you. It's finished.

93
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:27,759
The moment I get the feeling that she has a high fever, because somebody gets a high fever and feels better than before.

94
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:39,079
But the Bapt. gets a high fever and then they go into delusions and then she may go almost in half a coma.

95
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:47,009
That's why you may ask questions, she may answer and then back again into coma.

96
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:54,889
That is in real typhoid fever where because of these qualities of Bapt.

97
00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:02,369
Bapt. is one of the main remedies for typhoid kind of fevers.

98
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:12,869
There is another point also.

99
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:37,039
With the fever there is a brownish, red face with the idea that the person is not there, is not present.

100
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:49,599
They can describe this, what they call confusion. There is a great confusion which the person has

101
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:54,839
and cannot come back to himself.
It cannot be absolutely present.

102
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:07,269
Then this idea comes where he feels scattered. One person may describe it, 'I feel one piece there, one piece there'.

103
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:14,959
Another person may feel, 'I'm two persons', another person will say, 'my soul is out and my body is here'.

104
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:24,170
It doesn't matter. High fever with diarrhea which is offensive and that state of mind, this is Bapt.

105
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:32,099
 These are hospital cases. Bapt. are really hospital cases.

106
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:40,909
That means the person starts with a fever, he will not start on Bapt.

107
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:52,599
He will start with Bell. he will start with Acon., with Bry. etc. Then the zymotic fever progresses

108
00:20:52,600 --> 00:21:05,399
and that type of fever which is brought about
by typhus then the delusional state comes and then the person

109
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:15,540
 starts going deep into slumber. This is the English word.

110
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:24,329
When you're dozed heavily. When you cannot wake up.

111
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:40,369
 If they ask you 'what is your name?' and will say, 'George...'. That's a Bapt. case.

112
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:53,229
You mean you ask just one question, if it is too deep and of course the room smells all together because

113
00:21:53,230 --> 00:22:02,479
all the excretions are offensive but especially the diarrhea.

114
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:19,489
So high fever, diarrhea offensive and then you have a pneumonia case where the fever continues

115
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:28,719
you prescribe one remedy after another, the fever continues to be high, there is a time where you see the person

116
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:41,249
really going into comatose kind of state and you get very afraid and suddenly he has some very offensive diarrhea.

117
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,519
That is a case of Bapt.

118
00:22:51,810 --> 00:23:01,329
The organism cannot tolerate the fever. The fever overwhelms the person and the person goes into coma.

119
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:14,039
Closes and opens his eyes, if you try to talk to them, they go back into comatose state.

120
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:24,109
You're having the children, how is called this angina ludovici?

121
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:42,320
What is a very severe tonsillitis where the children can die; they are different types of tonsillitis.

122
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,999
One tonsillitis is 'ludovici cynanche' is called in Greek.

123
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:04,730
An angina which is called ludovici angina.

124
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,859
I refresh your allopathic knowledge.

125
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:33,573
-One question about the typhoid fever. If you have a typhoid without diarrhea, do you give Bapt. as well?

126
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:45,879
-Yes, I can give as long as there is this type of color in the face, the comatose state and the feeling of being

127
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,119
 separated, 'where are my pieces?'

128
00:24:51,640 --> 00:25:02,309
And you will need this in progressed stages of fever, not in the beginning. In the beginning, even if it is Bapt. case

129
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,919
you will not be able to recognize it.

130
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:14,279
Because unless you have these points, you cannot recognize Bapt. Unless the person says immediately

131
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:21,039
goes into the mental state of being separated or scattered.

132
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:39,019
An inner feeling also of restlessness but the tiredness is so much that they cannot move. Just exhaustion.

133
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:59,999
These children, unless you get the remedy quickly, you better give antibiotics because they will chock up and ...

134
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:08,719
I have seen two cases in my life. One we managed to cure. The other went to antibiotics.

135
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:20,839
And the doctor who was attending was not a pediatrician because the doctors see cases in Athens, from old to small.

136
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:29,879
They are not separating. So he did not recognize the seriousness and by that time they used to give me a paper

137
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:37,629
in which I prescribed. I would prescribe 60 cases, I read and I prescribe, I read and I prescribe.

138
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:54,949
And of course I prescribed wrongly and the child came to me and I said, this is not a simple tonsillitis, be careful.

139
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,949
And this case I remember it went to antibiotics finally.

140
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,070
-Do you remember what the angina looked like?

141
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:28,779
-The problem is that the doctor takes the case, he brings me the paper, so I read the description.

142
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:42,689
 I don't have a direct, so I cannot really tell you. But what is important is that the fever continues to be very high

143
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:58,329
 and continuous, the tonsils are very swollen
 and there are lymph nodes around the area

144
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:08,479
 which are growing and you see the child
 will go very soon into a comatose state.

145
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:17,000
This is the time when if you have this idea of scattered ...

146
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:33,769
The idea of health is, what do they say when they have a health, they say I'm not centered.

147
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,989
What do you mean centered? I am together.

148
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:50,319
The disease goes to go the opposite way. I'm in pieces and Bapt. has this very strongly.

149
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:57,319
That means is very seriously ill.
That means death is imminent.

150
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:13,449
In the death process what happens is actually the disintegration of the soul eventually.

151
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:25,219
You get  this disintegration of the body
 with the soul. They are disintegrated.

152
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,059
The soul goes away, you little ones don't be afraid.

153
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:42,120
The soul goes out, the mental-emotional goes out and the body disintegrates.

154
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:51,289
 But this fact, this disassociation is a disintegration.

155
00:29:51,970 --> 00:30:02,039
So this disintegration is the idea of death. The idea of death goes into entropy, goes into total entropy.

156
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,799
Then the whole world comes back.

157
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:20,389
And this disintegration may continue after death, that means your soul, the pieces, the organs of the soul

158
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:27,639
or the organs of the mind are also disintegrated and going back the way that the organs of the physical body

159
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:35,219
are going back to minerals and vitamins.

160
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:46,199
In the same way the disintegration of the soul, unless you have integrated yourself into a being.

161
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:59,449
Through your evolutionary efforts to evolve as a real human being.

162
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:17,999
Which is, we come back to the idea of health, love. Love unites, hatred divides.

163
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:30,079
So you make yourself full of love, you are leaving this body in a unified state and you remain as a human being.

164
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:42,319
You leave this body full of hatred, then you are going to be divided into pieces.

165
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:49,409
The Bapt. state, my head is going there, etc...

166
00:31:52,160 --> 00:32:10,559
That is why when the patients are dying, the general idea is bring a priest so he can confess, so the hatred

167
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:19,100
 what he has kept inside, as dividing elements, are out and are gone from the soul.

168
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:30,319
So the soul can remain united. That's why the dying patient you have to help in this way.

169
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:44,799
You keep them with their senses alive, with their brain alive, not make them vegetables because once they are

170
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,059
vegetables where is the possibility?

171
00:32:48,060 --> 00:33:02,559
We kept this man 6 months, as vegetable. He has no chance this man in the last transition to do whatever he has to do.

172
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:14,559
Because by the time one dies, there is the truth. It's finished, that's it, we don't have anymore to go.

173
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:25,779
So what are you going to do? Then that moment they need to confess. Mothers who hated their children, they apologize

174
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:30,679
children who hated their mothers, they apologize.

175
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:41,929
Then there is a kind of release and then the soul goes out more happy.

176
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:55,879
But in our medical world, they don't pay attention to any of this. They say you make them a vegetable

177
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,919
and we'll see what happens. Maybe
 he will survive, maybe he will die.

178
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,799
 Most people die in the state of vegetable.

179
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:18,719
Few survive this vegetable state. And Bapt. is therefore close to death.

180
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:28,069
You understand you have a Bapt. case, you know death is near. Don't play. Be aware.

181
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:38,819
The organism reaches to the point of disintegration. You see the idea?

182
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:58,319
-I thought till now and I heard about acute cases of Bapt. and when you say that this is very close to death

183
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,629
 it's looking like to be only for acute and subacute cases.

184
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,639
Do you have the experience also with chronic cases?

185
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:17,479
- I cannot remember now, I don't have it in my mind. Most probably I have prescribed a few cases

186
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:33,950
but these cases most usually you will find before getting totally disintegrated in their minds. Before schizophrenia.

187
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:45,319
You can save certain individuals who are going towards schizophrenia, towards this breaking up.

188
00:35:45,320 --> 00:36:02,880
Once they have this feeling of breaking up in themselves and at the same time there are very offensive discharges.

189
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:16,480
Maybe this physical symptom: brown strip in center of tongue. Like this.

190
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:35,719
You get a symptom like this and it may lead you to the idea of Bapt. and curing a severe mental case.

191
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:53,879
The offensiveness is in all discharges. It's not in diarrhea but in diarrhea, as she said, you cannot imagine

192
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,319
 the foullness of the offensiveness of diarrhea.

193
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:15,639
The offensiveness is the idea of disintegration. When something disintegrates, then it has bad odor.

194
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,250
The same with the soul, when the soul disintegrates.

195
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:53,829
You will think of Brom. in two pathological cases. One is in respiratory problems, asthma and also when you have

196
00:37:53,830 --> 00:38:01,940
lymph nodes, lymphatic system which is swollen lymphs, which are swollen and hard.

197
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:08,979
 Two characteristics, the one is aggravation when the person is over heated.

198
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,080
Like another remedy, a very well known remedy,

199
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,600
Pulsatilla.

200
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:38,179
And also a peculiar aggravation is when somebody who is a sailor and lives in the sea, he gets

201
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,169
problem when he comes ashore.

202
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:52,639
He comes back to his village and the problem starts. Usually is an asthmatic condition.

203
00:38:52,640 --> 00:39:07,919
Brom. also will look like, in respiratory problems, like Ant-t. This has a lot of mucus which cannot come out.

204
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:25,559
In the hospitals you heard this when there is a
 lot of mucus in the chest and there is no power

205
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,259
 to bring it out and to clear the lungs.

206
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:40,120
This rattling stays with the respiration, strong rattling the one that I reproduced.

207
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:53,589
Eventually I will even die for you to show you. Showing, showing, then finally I will have to show how you die.

208
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:09,449
Wait until I finish the course, that's all we need. To finish this course, then you die.

209
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:26,959
It is natural, you see a lot of my students they thought once George has taught us, most probably he will die.

210
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:39,439
Because I always said, I have a bad health and blah, blah and everyone thought after this course, he is finished.

211
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,919
And this is the ambition of every good student.

212
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:57,699
The teacher dies so I can become next. No it's OK, I'm just joking, don't worry.

213
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:10,439
Neither you or me we are going to find the time of death because this is preordained by other forces

214
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,679
which have nothing to do with the jokes.

215
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:27,039
Brom. patients have something which is between Con. and Puls. You remember Con.? Remember Puls.?

216
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:41,879
There is something of that type. That means they are hard individuals. They are not flexible.

217
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:50,999
That's why they have that information, very hard lymphatic node.

218
00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:08,439
You see the people who do not eliminate, who keep inside, the lymphatic system which main function

219
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:17,919
 is to eliminate the toxins, is not able and the person keeps it inside.

220
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:25,919
Therefore they keep inside the emotions and they become emotionless.

221
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:33,829
You remember the end stage of Puls. that we have described?

222
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:47,199
How Puls. they will sit for hours like this not talking, not responding.

223
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,580
You give something to eat.

224
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:56,209
It's similar this remedy.

225
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:20,959
 And this state will be either coming because of a mental or emotional shock or will be coming as a deterioration of the mind.

226
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:34,250
The mind becomes slowly more and more deteriorated and then it reaches what today they call Alzheimer's disease.

227
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:44,073
 No emotions; sit there and stare without
any emotions without any thoughts.

228
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:55,659
 Stony hardness, where the brain is full of hard points.

229
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:04,599
The brain is all the time with this synapses,
 with communications, receiving, giving out.

230
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:13,629
This brain becomes more and more hard, more and more stony.

231
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:21,649
And if you perceive it, your mind should go. And you ask, show me your tongue.

232
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:29,629
Sometimes tricks like this, will help. I'm talking about Bapt.

233
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:38,020
Touch your knee.

234
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,900
 Which is the remedy which has cold knees?

235
00:44:43,901 --> 00:44:46,629
Phosphorus.

236
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,660
You see how you remember?
