1
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,900
Sang. is an excitable person.

2
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:12,679
With a specific sensitivity towards the wet weather.

3
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:25,389
Wet weather aggravates all her symptoms. If she has a headache, it makes it worse. If she has an anxiety,  it makes it worse.

4
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:40,789
If she has a dull mind, this becomes almost like a torpor. She just can't think in wet weather.

5
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:47,769
So it's a remedy which very is strongly aggravates by wet weather.

6
00:01:48,110 --> 00:02:00,459
It's a remedy which primarily will have an affection on the right side of the body and it's a remedy

7
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:10,919
for headaches which are situated on the right side of the head. Especially when the headaches start

8
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:21,899
from the right occipital protuberance, the headache starts from here and goes over to the eye.

9
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:34,729
The headaches are very strong, the inflammations which are produced in this remedy are very strong

10
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,659
and remind one of Bell.

11
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:55,609
But the great modality for Sang. is the nausea and the vomiting.

12
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:08,109
Almost all her ailments are accompanied by nausea which change up in vomiting.

13
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:22,169
There is a climax. If you see a Sang. headache, you will see the person is almost in a torpor.

14
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:29,359
The head is so painful and it goes higher and higher and higher.

15
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,349
The moment that the headache starts going up, the nausea comes up.

16
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:47,489
Then during the high peak of the headache, the person will go to vomit 1 time, 2-3 times, then with the vomiting

17
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:52,019
you will see a release.

18
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:10,750
Another thing which will make you look is sanguine. Sanguine is red. It means red in Latin.

19
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,920
So red cheeks like Bell.

20
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:46,289
And it is a remedy that you will need very frequently in right shoulder joint arthritis which is tremendously painful.

21
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:58,529
The arm almost becomes immovable. You have given different remedies and the arm less and less moves

22
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,039
 until it is almost ankylosed.

23
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:15,559
It's very painful especially in bed. Once they lie down, the pain becomes excruciating and it can continue the whole night.

24
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:30,389
So if somebody says, right sided inflammation on the shoulder joint, worse in the night, the first remedy you think is Sang.

25
00:05:44,250 --> 00:06:00,589
Also in their headaches are sensitive to light, sensitive to odors; odors will make them vomit.

26
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:17,099
They have an anxiety which rises and then they enter a place where there is some odor and the nausea comes

27
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:25,687
and they even have to vomit from odors.
It doesn't have to be a bad odor.

28
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:35,639
 They have asthmatic conditions which are aggravated very much by any kind of odor.

29
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,700
Light also aggravates them. Wet weather very much.

30
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:52,600
Inflammation of the joints, especially of the right shoulder joint, in wet climates.

31
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:59,489
They go and visit a wet climate and then the inflammation starts.

32
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:24,609
Warm and wet it can be or cold and wet, as long as wet it's bad for Sang. This weather now here is a wet weather.

33
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:39,639
So if any of you fell down with this arthritis or periarthritis, it's the same, on the right shoulder.

34
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:52,080
Especially they can do this movement. It's totally impossible to do. To raise their arm it will go like this.

35
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:54,979
They cannot comb.

36
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:02,319
Then eventually the inflammation becomes more and more and it can be very severe.

37
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:19,239
But all their symptomatology is accompanied by nausea. Sadness, anxiety, fears accompanied by nausea.

38
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:28,539
When you hear this modality, headache accompanied by nausea and vomiting, when the vomiting comes

39
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:39,309
that is the 'lysis', the crisis is finished through vomiting.

40
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:53,559
Hay fever with sensitivity to odors.

41
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:18,959
And there is a peculiar keynote, for instance coughing which is ameliorated by passing flatus.

42
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:26,130
This is a very peculiar symptom. If you get it you grab it.

43
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:32,340
Coughing ameliorated by flatus.

44
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:44,289
Vomiting ameliorates headaches very strongly. You get a headache and they go crazy.

45
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:59,029
That remedy is one of the main remedies that in wet weather they become paralyzed.

46
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:05,049
The mind does not function, nothing functions and then the pain starts.

47
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,810
That's it. You don't have anything more.

48
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:45,239
With sexuality, they are people with excessive sexuality, with some eccentricity. Eccentric people

49
00:10:45,240 --> 00:11:09,989
and also affected very much, especially men but women also, after sex. Very tired, finished, after sexual orgasm.

50
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,459
-When you have the shoulder pain, do you have any headache at all?

51
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:30,169
-When you have the shoulder pain is not together with headaches.

52
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:43,899
The headache is tremendous. It starts here, it goes over here to the eye and then no light, no smell, any smell

53
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:54,149
any light, any noise makes it much worse
and then the nausea comes, lying down.

54
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,849
They can lie for hours, for two days like this.

55
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:08,269
-And the redness of the cheek? With the shoulder I mean, does it have to be there?

56
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:16,499
-No, it doesn't have to be. If they say, I'm worse as soon as I'm going to bed and I suffer all night, as long as

57
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,279
I'm lying down, that is Sang.

58
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:26,529
You ask her whether she can put behind this, whether she can do that, she says impossible.

59
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,309
Raise your arm, nothing.

60
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:37,069
-I have a patient with the right sided shoulder pain and this patient tells me that she feels exhausted

61
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:42,449
when the weather is cloudy. Is that?

62
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:54,769
-That's it. Cloudy weather and at the moment the weather becomes cloudy and wet, she starts having headaches

63
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:06,789
 pains, cannot think, cannot concentrate. Otherwise they are fast, they get ideas, they are excitable.

64
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:25,289
Nausea and vomiting especially with the headache, not necessarily with the shoulder. When I say anxiety

65
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:36,119
which is accompanied by nausea, they get the anxiety and then the nausea, your mind should go to Sang.

66
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:04,839
Valer. is a woman's remedy, as you can see, very seldom you give it to a man. Men are not hysterical.

67
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,759
Do even men get hysteria? Never. It's a woman's disease.

68
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:44,539
Hysterical, nervous temperament, oversensitiveness of all senses.

69
00:14:44,540 --> 00:15:00,799
You see this restlessness, this hysteria, crying and laughing, changing symptoms.

70
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:14,129
A person who is very nervous and restless
 and irritable and acting hysterically.

71
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:25,049
Then next day she is suffering with her stomach, she is suffering with some physical ailments.

72
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:33,440
And they alternate between mental symptoms, emotional symptoms and physical symptoms.

73
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:49,310
Sensation as if a thread hanging down the throat.

74
00:15:50,760 --> 00:16:05,759
Sensation of a hair is Kali-bi. and Sil., sensation of a thread, Valer.

75
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:29,089
You know Sil. have all the time a sense that a hair has stuck in the mouth.

76
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:40,269
So they clean the tongue all the time and the same with Kali-bi.

77
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:51,770
Now with this remedy there is another hysterical symptom, they feel something is hanging over, a kind of

78
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:56,139
a string is hanging in the throat.

79
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:14,169
It can be the cause for them to feel that I have cancer. This sensation may give them the idea that they may have cancer.

80
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:38,409
They have symptoms like Rhus-t. where the pains can develop or the sciatica can develop during rest

81
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:43,159
 and the sciatica is better on motion.

82
00:17:55,090 --> 00:18:03,679
They have this feeling of Lac-c. and Lach. as if floating in the air.

83
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:23,700
It's a remedy which you need very very
seldom also. It's not an everyday remedy.

84
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:41,549
 Because in the Repertory you will find a lot of symptoms in the sciatica section and lumbar region with Valer.

85
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:49,999
which do not work. You take the symptoms,
you repertorize, Valer. has never worked.

86
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,999
Unless you have this hysteria behind the patient.

87
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:32,409
The symptoms actually of Valer. are not easy to pin down because what we see in symptomatology...

88
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:42,110
pains and cramps come in different locations all these there are a lot of other remedies which have similar symptoms.

89
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:53,789
We don't get really something, child vomits
curd milk, this is in so many remedies. Thin watery diarrhoea

90
00:19:53,790 --> 00:20:03,150
Rheumatic pains, constant jerking,
 earache from exposal to drafts and cold.
