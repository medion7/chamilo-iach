1
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:35,619
We're going to talk about small remedies.

2
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:44,130
I have to make a little introduction concerning such remedies, as we will be talking about.

3
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,109
Students get excited, we're going to learn a new remedy.

4
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:02,119
The remedies we're going to talk this time you will need perhaps once or twice or three times in your lifetime.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,199
And good luck if you can recognize it, when it comes. It comes unexpectedly.

6
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:19,439
The patients are coming one after the other and in the middle of all that, you remember maybe that this might look like this.

7
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:29,039
But this you're going to do it for each remedy. Once maybe for sure.

8
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:42,479
It is nice to know but very seldom to be used.

9
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:51,419
Most of the bulk of your patients will be covered by what we call main remedies.

10
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:04,640
In my years of practice which are completed 40 years, this year.

11
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,019
I didn't say it for applaud, I said it with a regret.

12
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:33,340
I needed very seldom such remedies to help me in the prescribing.

13
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:47,359
I found very early in my practice that most of the cases are covered by what we know to be the main remedies.

14
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:57,559
The Merc's, the Calc's, the Sulph., Lyc., Phos., Ars., Nux-v. etc.

15
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:07,899
So don't get over excited about small remedies because you are going to be disappointed.

16
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,129
Now I have to say a few more things concerning new remedies which are appearing.

17
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:24,659
And this is a good thing that we have some new remedies appearing.

18
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:35,839
The bad thing about it is that most of their symptomatology come from imagination and not from proving.

19
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:50,329
So you can use imagination quite a lot and then this information circulates and there comes an individual

20
00:03:50,330 --> 00:04:01,739
who has given a remedy X. I hear also some remedies we are taught, they don't exist.

21
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,719
I mean chemically is not possible to make such remedies.

22
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:17,959
But the imagination of the teacher makes it possible and also made a symptomatology.

23
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:27,999
You get a practitioner who takes that remedy and gives it to most of his patients, most probably.

24
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,219
Out of his patients there is one or two that they are so suggestible that they will say, oh this remedy is excellent.

25
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,889
 I had this, this, that, all are gone.

26
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:56,649
But you remember yesterday Nina, I think, she said every remedy I was given, in the beginning I was feeling very well.

27
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:15,359
So don't misunderstand the suggestibility of a patient, the placebo effect with the real action of a remedy.

28
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:26,799
As I have said many times, in order to have action usually we have reaction. We have an aggravation.

29
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:36,159
Somebody comes and says, 'I felt so much better from your remedy'. This you have to doubt most of the times

30
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,519
whether this is really so, whether the remedy was correct.

31
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,759
And we have to be very careful with this field, Homeopathy.

32
00:05:52,760 --> 00:06:02,479
Because it's a new field, it's not controlled, anybody can inject into the teaching, anything he likes.

33
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:12,999
I have heard so crazy things which are unbelievable. I asked a few people to make a catalogue of these

34
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,999
crazy things which are going on.

35
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:32,949
One of the craziest was that a patient was coming wearing a shirt with lines, so the practitioner thought

36
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:37,579
definitely this is a case of zebra!

37
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:51,449
So he tried to take the milk of the zebra and give it to the patient. Of course there was an effect.

38
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:06,189
Because the remedy was quite exotic! I mean this type of things which are going on with Homeopathy

39
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:12,249
it is not a light thing that you can just ignore.

40
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:22,229
No. Because this passes into the information of serious people in Medicine and they say, 'they are crazy'.

41
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,759
'Homeopaths? They are crazy, forget them'.

42
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:33,839
So it has an action repercussion on the science of Homeopathy.

43
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:44,419
Like the other one who thought she was looking like an eagle and she took a feather of the eagle, potentized it

44
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,509
 gave it to her and she was cured.

45
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,989
The patient was looking like an eagle.

46
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:07,799
She could fly. She was asking the whole class, what this patient looks like? And different people said different things

47
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,399
 like a snake, like an animal, like a flower,
the whole class suggested something.

48
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:22,399
Somebody suggested an eagle, so she says that's correct. She looks like an eagle, that's why I went

49
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,919
and got a feather from an eagle, potentized it and gave it to her.

50
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:34,360
And then she believes it herself, she is seriously.

51
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:48,970
But she has mislead herself to believe that this was curing this patient. It is a placebo effect.

52
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:17,560
We talk about Collinsonia Canadensis.

53
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:56,089
These little remedies of course you will try after you have tried bigger remedies and they have failed.

54
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:05,319
Now Coll., I will give you the essence, what I have observed.

55
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:19,749
They are individuals who are very excitable, easily going into excitement and you can see their feelings

56
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:26,939
are over flowing, like swelling feelings.

57
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:38,929
A lot of feelings and over excitement and the organism takes the impact of such excitement and appears

58
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,679
certain symptomatology.

59
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:57,509
The main of which will be a feeling of swelling, a feeling of enlargement on the physical body in different parts.

60
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:10,409
Like the feelings inside they swell and they cannot be retained by the organism. They cannot be controlled.

61
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:19,689
In the same way the sensation is that the head is becoming bigger, larger.

62
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,669
They feel their face is becoming broadened.

63
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:47,479
They feel that swelling in different parts of the body but especially in the urino-genital area.

64
00:11:51,100 --> 00:12:03,809
A woman will feel, for instance, in genitalia a sensation as if swollen, especially the clitoris.

65
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:21,009
The man will feel the testes are swollen, it's a sensation. It's not a real swelling.

66
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:28,239
They feel the anus is swollen.

67
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:57,509
With this kind of swelling and tendency to swell, we have actually a tremendous appearance of hemorrhoids

68
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:09,559
especially connected with constipation and menses in women.

69
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:29,019
There is a connection between the pathology of hemorrhoids and the heart.

70
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:43,159
So whenever there is bleeding from the hemorrhoids, in heart patients, the heart pains are relieved.

71
00:13:49,920 --> 00:14:01,190
Also you will see an alternation between hemorrhoids and palpitation.

72
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,199
When the hemorrhoids are out  the palpitation goes away.

73
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:12,659
The hemorrhoids go in, the
 palpitation bothers the patient.

74
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:31,599
Coll. is one of the main remedies that you
have to think in very obstinate constipation.

75
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,050
Constipation that doesn't move with anything.

76
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:48,099
The bowels don't move even if there is urging, there is no effect.

77
00:14:48,100 --> 00:15:01,349
But most of the times there is no urging. They are just stuck and the patient will tell you the only way

78
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,359
to move my bowel is to take a lot of cathartic.

79
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:15,320
And then after taking cathartic, they feel very bad because the hemorrhoids come out, then they feel uneasy.

80
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:30,739
Don't forget these individuals are very excitable and anything that excites their system, makes them feel bad.

81
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:58,089
You may think of this remedy also in prolapsus of uterus or prolapsus of rectum and when this prolapsus happen

82
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,569
is quite strong.

83
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:35,879
As I said, the person is quite hysterical, excited easily and you may have hysterical convulsions during menses.

84
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:58,549
And such woman with constipation, with piles, who faint very easily when they have an abdominal pain

85
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:03,839
 and this brings a tendency to faint or they do faint.

86
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:30,679
Also this tendency to become bigger like the piles become big, the rectum comes out, the head becomes big

87
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:43,199
the face feels big, the same with any part which is affected the sensation is or there is real swelling.

88
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:53,529
 Sensation or real swelling can happen in affected part. If a part is inflamed, it will swell.

89
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:14,599
They may have a feeling of hands being swollen. The feet are swollen, there is a feeling or there are actually swelling.

90
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:29,199
But the general tendency is out of this excitement and the swelling of feelings, swelling of parts, feeling of swelling

91
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:37,560
 sensation of swelling, swelling and then inactivity and collapse.

92
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:57,849
Which is the uterus prolapses, the rectum prolapses.

93
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:05,609
If a woman comes and tells you for instance, I feel my clitoris, I have a sensation it's always swollen

94
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:13,762
and you see there is constipation and with the constipation there are hemorrhoids most probably

95
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:23,879
 the remedy is not Alum. Alum. has nothing to do with this because it's a different individual all together.

96
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:36,529
You don't give Alum. in such severe constipation, she will describe, because Alum. is dull. These people are excitable.

97
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:44,799
They are very quick to answer your questions and you see the feelings are over flowing.

98
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:52,120
 It's not to be confused with Alum. or Bry.

99
00:19:52,420 --> 00:20:03,449
Alum. and Bry. are two remedies which have malignant, severe constipation.

100
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:18,769
Together with Sil. I would say. Now each one has its own peculiarities that you cannot confuse.

101
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:43,509
When they have a headache, they want to sleep. There is a sleepy feeling during headache.

102
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:56,679
Convulsions during menses. Hysterical convulsions, not real convulsions.

103
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:17,089
This remedy gives you the idea of both the excitement and the collapse and then the swelling.

104
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:35,929
You have hemorrhoids and constipation and you have an excitable patient, think of Coll. to make it simple.

105
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:45,439
If such a person tells you that I have a sensation of swelling wherever it might be, think of Coll.

106
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:54,939
How many times I have given Coll. in my life? I think 3, 4 times.

107
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:09,099
And I don't remember even if these 4 times were all successful. You may have prescribed it but not successfully.

108
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:23,879
-One of her main complaints was that she was impressed easily and excited very easily, she was teaching yoga

109
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:33,959
and every time she was getting with clients, she was so impressed by them that she became bloated very quickly

110
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:45,159
and also severely constipated. She only very rarely had stools and could produce these with great effort.

111
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:53,599
She did not have hemorrhoids along with it but she was very bloated and also had the sensation of being

112
00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:00,959
very distended. I prescribed Coll. in low potency and had hardly any effect.

113
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,360
-It's not necessary to have the hemorrhage.

114
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:34,929
 Look at this portal system in Coll., it is affected. Therefore the heart  in conjunction has a repercussion upon this.

115
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:44,309
 So when there is a release, the heart is released, therefore you have  patients with weakness of heart

116
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:52,600
 heart conditions, constrictions of heart which are affected when the hemorrhoids are. This is one type of person.

117
00:23:52,760 --> 00:24:03,579
The other type, which is the constipation type, it doesn't necessarily need to have the hemorrhoids.

118
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:09,549
You may have the hemorrhoids, when you have the hemorrhoids, they are quite strong, they are coming out.

119
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:17,959
The patient will describe the hemorrhoids as something huge in Coll.

120
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:28,619
What you described is quite in the description and if you still have the patient, I would suggest that you try

121
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,909
 a higher potency or another pharmacy.

122
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,840
-I gave a low potency C6 or X6, three times the day and there was no effect.

123
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:56,629
-The problem with your patient seems to be quite on the emotional level primarily, being so excitable

124
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,359
 and therefore you need a higher potency.

125
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:08,439
Like yesterday when we spoke about the case when the problem is on the mental-emotional, you need to go

126
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:20,440
high to touch upon such cases. So try, this is quite good description. You have to try.

127
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:49,120
We'll talk about Equisetum.

128
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:20,729
Equis. may prove to be an interesting remedy and maybe you will need this remedy more frequently.

129
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:49,459
I have used it in cases of people who are tired and they feel restless and at the same time  prostrated, very tired.

130
00:26:50,960 --> 00:27:04,679
With an aversion to mental work which is a syndrome which we find frequently today.

131
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:22,209
Maybe when other remedies have failed, people who are irritable, restless and yet prostrated.

132
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:44,849
You see in Equis. there is a symptom. It says, the person is always like this, frown, in a state of inner irritability.

133
00:27:52,140 --> 00:28:04,219
Such people do not like to be touched.
It's like a state of irritability, don't touch.

134
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:16,779
Not exactly the aversion to touch that we had in the case we had seen but a different kind of reaction.

135
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:23,200
Irritable reaction, nervous reaction.

136
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:34,004
It's also a remedy which you will use in children when you have failed in enuresis of children.

137
00:28:34,104 --> 00:28:45,729
When you have failed with the different remedies and the enuresis persists, in a child 10,12, 13 years old.

138
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:55,759
The enuresis persists, you have tried different remedies, you have tried Rhus-t., Tub., Puls., Kreos., Bell., the whole lot.

139
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:07,199
And it fails, then you can try Equis., especially if the children are restless.

140
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:34,649
Equis. will be used mostly in pathology of the cyst, cystitis. Cystitis with all kinds of different symptoms.

141
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:39,639
Frequent urination, painful urination.

142
00:29:48,130 --> 00:30:02,639
It has here, in the end of urination, actually after urination there is pain which continues for some time.

143
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:14,119
Great pain at the end or urination is wrong in the expression because which remedy is in the end of urination?

144
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:20,789
Sarsaparilla and another remedy?

145
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,479
At the end of urination means the urine has not stopped.

146
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:39,039
The urine comes to the end and the moment it starts dribling, in the end, then the pain comes.

147
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:51,359
Then the urination stops and the pain goes away. With Equis. is when the urine stops, then the pain starts.

148
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:22,189
Constant urging to urinate. It has a symptom like Nux-v., very frequent urination but very little urine is voided.

149
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:30,879
Therefore the less urine, the more frequent is the urge.

150
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:50,759
Don't forget this prostration. It looks like almost a prostration for Pic-ac. That's why you will use it in old people who feel

151
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:59,249
 tired in their mind, restless, they cannot sleep, they cannot think they cannot do any mental work

152
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:07,079
 and yet their bladder is paralyzed and retains the urine.

153
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:22,259
Retention of urine in old people, tired, prostrated, especially with brain tiredness.

154
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:38,009
Also retention of urine after delivery.

155
00:32:53,010 --> 00:33:09,239
And a main sensation is a fullness in the bladder which prevents urination.

156
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:27,419
If they manage to urinate, this fullness of course is relieved.

157
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:42,840
We don't know more about these remedies.

158
00:33:47,680 --> 00:34:00,119
 These are good cases for publication. In case you have a case as long as it is not placebo effect.

159
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:08,439
If you have a case like this, it is always good to publish such cases because we may be learning a little bit more

160
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,439
 about their mental-emotional pathology.

161
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:50,549
Diosc. is a remedy that you will need more than 3 times in your life time.

162
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,599
Who has a Diosc. case so far?

163
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:27,799
You will need Diosc. mostly in colic cases which are of a severe type.

164
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:44,949
That means the person out of pain is shouting, it feels that the intestines they just turn around.

165
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:52,890
And the tendency of the person is of course to double up.

166
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:59,249
In such cases almost automatically the patient wants to double.

167
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:04,769
And while she is doubling up, she feels the pain is even worse.

168
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:16,629
And then they find out that the best position for them is, if they can stand it, to over extend their body.

169
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:22,199
So they will sit like this.

170
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,340
They still shout but they know the moment
they go like that, it's much worse.

171
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:38,349
So they have to stay in that position, shouting and crying and this comes with a diarrhea or without a diarrhea.

172
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:50,599
These cramps can be uterus cramps, can be small intestines, large intestines, gallbladder, kidney colics.

173
00:36:51,680 --> 00:37:03,929
The modalities will always be the same. It's cramping, stitching pain, tearing pain and the amelioration

174
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:11,159
will come when they sit up and they make like this, over extended.

175
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,599
This is a keynote which is not stressed in the Materia Medicas.

176
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:26,349
 I don't know if it's even mentioned in the Materia Medica but it is a keynote which I found it is almost infallible.

177
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:35,609
And I have stressed it in other cases as well.

178
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:51,689
Another interesting thing for Diosc. is that while she is having such pains, these pains may just suddenly go away

179
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:57,689
and pains appear in the fingers or in the toes.

180
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:12,020
Then these pains become so painful
and the visceral area is ameliorated.

181
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:24,799
Also they will tell you if you ask them where the pain is extending the pains extend downwards and upwards.

182
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,779
 They can go anywhere. They can go around. They can go up, they can go down.

183
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:46,399
When there is diarrhea, for instance, it's usually yellowish, thin, yellowish, frequent stool but the stool

184
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,919
does not relieve the colic.

185
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:23,679
Colicky people who are prone to have colics all their life. You get a case of colic or even pains in the back.

186
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:38,079
It's very strange how they can appear these pains in the extremities, out of the blue.

187
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:49,859
While these central pains of the back or the abdomen or the colics are releasing.

188
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:21,819
The type of Diosc. is an individual who is tired in mind and soul, who is avoiding company, parties, people

189
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:33,549
discussions, because they tire him and the
 mind becomes more and more tired.

190
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,110
And then they start forgetting words.

191
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,179
Or they change words, one word for another.

192
00:40:53,180 --> 00:41:05,559
They want to say right and they say left they want to say apples and they say melon.

193
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:28,649
But as the organism goes down and they feel tired and exhausted, at the same time they start having nightly emissions.

194
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:45,249
The men during sleep they have orgasms and these orgasms whether there is a natural coition or an orgasm

195
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:51,839
of that type, leaves the individual in a terrible state.

196
00:41:51,840 --> 00:42:07,049
Either depression or irritability or discomfort, as if all the energy has been taken away from this individual.

197
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:23,359
After coition, after emissions, they don't like to sit down and read or do any kind of mental work.

198
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:41,719
Eventually they lose all their initiative for doing something creative.

199
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:57,279
One more keynote is that after stool, they feel confused, they feel the mind is not clear.

200
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:04,630
It is the opposite of which remedies?

201
00:43:04,631 --> 00:43:23,239
Nat-s. and Calc.

202
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:34,609
Calc. and Nat-s. they have exactly the opposite. Their mind becomes clear and joyful.

203
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:49,689
Also this remedy has another symptom, for those who drink a lot of tea and as soon as they drink tea, there is a kind of

204
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:59,859
fermentation and there is burping and a lot of gas, comes out from drinking tea.

205
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:05,369
Also this remedy is a remedy which produces a lot of gas.

206
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:40,179
The colics are not continuous, they are coming in severe crisis, as I described, then they subside and they come again.

207
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:54,519
The intensity of the pain is tremendous. It's one of the most painful remedies of the Materia Medica in colics.

208
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:03,079
 Together and even worse than Colocynthis.

209
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:27,119
And they are generally relieved by walking,
 they feel they must walk.

210
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:42,120
The time of aggravation is in the evening and in the night.

211
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:59,309
 especially towards the midnight, as the night goes on and midnight becomes very bad.

212
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:10,200
- I have a patient who is living with severe stress, their parents in law and her own parents are all evil.

213
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:18,489
And they're annoying her like tyrants. And when they have an attack even in the middle of the night they call her.

214
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:24,250
This patient has only a sensitive stomach and quite frequently reacted to Coloc.

215
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:32,679
What was interesting is that the patient said, 'when my parents or parents in law call in the middle of the night

216
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:40,009
 I don't even discuss with them anymore. I cannot longer take it. All I do is to throw the phone.'

217
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:47,369
She was so exhausted all this time and then developed these cramps. The cramps awoke her at night

218
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:54,400
 and in the beginning she tried to draw up her knees which aggravated everything. So in the middle of the night

219
00:46:54,401 --> 00:47:02,969
she had to leave her bed, walk around and bend her back backwards. The cramps were really terrible

220
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:13,079
and no diarrhea or anything, just these colics. I had then prescribed Diosc., a 6X to take 3 times the day.

221
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:30,509
-I have a question. I repeatedly gave Diosc. for colics of babies. Those are babies who really terribly stretch

222
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:38,040
 their back and bend backwards, as far as
 they can, and now you said tea aggravates.

223
00:47:38,041 --> 00:47:41,349
What kind of tea are you talking about?

224
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,589
-Black tea mostly.

225
00:47:55,510 --> 00:48:03,829
-This is the case of an army person who was admitted in the hospital and when I had gone to examine him

226
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:13,179
 he was leaning against the hospital bed, far back, against his back because of the pain

227
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:17,379
and he had beads of perspiration, he was running high temperature.

228
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:27,149
He had been diagnosed having pancreatitis, the pain was beside himself, he was receiving an analgesic

229
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:33,509
and in pancreatitis you can only put down the pain and give intravenous fluids for the whole thing to subside

230
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:49,079
 on its own but nothing was helping him. The only indication was that he had to lean far, far back for this terrible pain

231
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:59,439
to subside; it was coming in spasms and his serum amylase levels when I had gone to visit him was 485

232
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:09,239
which should be less than 90. In the ultrasound there was quite a lot of fluid around the pancreas which is usual to have

233
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:21,019
 during this time. I prescribed Diosc. 1M very frequently 2hourly until the relief would come and then to take it as SOS

234
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:31,239
and in 48 hours the pain was practically gone. By the 4th day his serum amylase level was down to 170

235
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:38,959
and then to 90 within a week time. Even the doctor in the army hospital said that this is too quick recovery

236
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,719
because the fluid was also getting absorbed very quickly around the pancreas. There was no complication

237
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:52,739
of cyst formation which generally comes after pancreatitis and no other remedy was given afterwards.

238
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:58,760
-So you are an army doctor now? Very good.

239
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:16,499
I presented some of the cases in a Congress, where about 15-18 Professors of Medicine gathered

240
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:25,999
and together with them was the head of the army medical, a general.

241
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:47,519
He was in the beginning... and in the end he told me that he will help the doctors who were in the army

242
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:59,999
 about 10 army doctors are in the army at this moment, he will help them to infiltrate the medical practice

243
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,849
of the army with Homeopathy. He was really impressed.

244
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:22,679
And on Saturday I have an appointment with the second man in a Medical University in Greece who was

245
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:31,509
also present there and who is determined to put Homeopathy into the University.

246
00:51:55,020 --> 00:52:06,900
One more remedy which has some validity as a specific.

247
00:52:06,901 --> 00:52:11,850
Myristica.

248
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:37,839
It's a remedy which I have prescribed several times and it has given amazing results only with a specific situation.

249
00:52:41,830 --> 00:53:05,739
When in the finger around, that part is inflamed and usually these kind of inflammations can be quite strong and persistent.

250
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:24,159
Myris. will give almost invariably some effect. This you give it only in the case when somebody  tells you I have this problem.

251
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:33,579
It is not a remedy that can be prescribed in a general symptomatology of the patient because we don't know

252
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,929
the symptomatology of Myris.

253
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:47,129
But perhaps out of these cases that you give it, maybe a constipation will be cured or something else will be cured

254
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:56,999
then you just write down the new symptoms
 that were cured by this peculiar remedy.

255
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:08,039
As far as I'm concerned this is the only situation in which Myris. will really give an effect.

256
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:31,759
And not when there is a little bit of inflammation around here but when really there is progressed inflammation

257
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,029
 with the swelling and pain quite a lot.

258
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:46,519
Whether it is foot or toes or fingers it doesn't matter, as long as it is around this.

259
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:55,269
 Sometimes it has acted when the inflammation also is on another part, it is localized inflammation

260
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:57,319
 but mostly on this.

261
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:10,260
This is a kind of miraculous remedy that by just looking you can say the remedy and then you have the effect.
