1
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:40,899
I'd like to give you some information. These remedies are not finished and the information is not compiled.

2
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:55,619
I cannot really give you any good information
 on the mental-emotional level of Sanic.

3
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:05,460
There are a few things that I have noticed.

4
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:30,479
 Sanic. has a state of marasmus.

5
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,330
Marasmus of the body, of the mind,
 of the emotions as well.

6
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:49,079
The mind becomes weak and usually there is aversion to any kind of mental undertaking.

7
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:56,779
Also if they do undertake something, they
do not have the stamina to go and finish it.

8
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:09,729
In a conversation they maybe jumping from one subject to another without really completing the subject on which they are talking.

9
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:24,849
There is some depression and also the feeling that something bad is going to happen.

10
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:52,839
In children we see some kind of reaction and obstinacy, they get very easily angry and they become aggressive and they throw things.

11
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:08,490
There are some fears that look like Calc.

12
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:24,399
Fear of dark, fear to work, fear that
something bad will happen.

13
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,799
They are easily upset, irritated.

14
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Just a few general ideas. Many times you
will see a case which looks like Calc.

15
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:55,119
There is the perspiration, the desire for sweets, the desire for salt, perspiration around the occiput.

16
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:07,079
There is worse cold but there is a heat of
the feet that they have to stick out the feet.

17
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:14,079
A Calc. that sticks out the feet, think of Sanic.

18
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:27,929
If it is a case of Calc., you think it's Calc. but the feet are warm and they have to stick them out of cover, think of Calc. when all the other symptoms agree.

19
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:53,119
Especially when we have this typical symptom of perspiration of the scalp and occiput during sleep, which we all think Calc., then it might be a case of Sanic..

20
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:10,829
Also there is photophobia and lacrimation if there is some wind, which is again the same thing as Calc.

21
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:18,019
The only thing is that Calc. is
lacrimating from one eye in open air.

22
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:47,409
There are some ear discharges and ear eruptions excoriated etc. and the discharges of Sanic. usually are offensive and the offensiveness is like fish.

23
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:57,489
Any discharge from any place which
has the smell of fish indicates Sanic.

24
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:09,599
In the face we have acne and
especially acne around the chin.

25
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:36,459
Generally the skin looks unhealthy and also not nourished well. That's why Sanic. presents a state of cachexia, of mal nourishment.

26
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:58,549
Sometimes there is a burning in the tongue which is quite in the seat of the tongue and many times we will have to let it out and cool it.

27
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:27,719
We have desire salt, sweets,  fat.

28
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:41,359
In the thirst we have the same thirst as Ars., drinking small quantities frequently.

29
00:07:47,480 --> 00:08:05,349
We have vomiting immediately after eating and also after drinking milk. The vomiting usually is forcible, like a rocket, like Veratrum album.

30
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:28,739
The abdomen is again like Calc., enlarged and flabby and many times children that are malnurished they need Sanic. instead of Calc.

31
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:41,679
We have a constipation which is like Sil.,
stool difficult to evacuate or  receding.

32
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:22,619
Sometimes you have flatus which is very offensive and sometimes you have involuntary stool and involuntary urination.

33
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:46,019
There is leucorrhea, there is also another smell characteristic of Sanic. and that is cheese. Like old cheese.

34
00:09:46,020 --> 00:10:01,669
But the smelling of the fish is much more characteristic. The smell of old cheese is characteristic mostly of Hep.

35
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:24,319
We have all kind of lumbagos and pains in the back and in the extremities, we have this characteristic of uncovering the extremities.

36
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,059
The soles of the feet are burning.

37
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:55,300
We have quite a lot of cracks, especially
 in the back of the hands here.

38
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,830
Sanic. has fear of robbers and
also dreams of robbers.
