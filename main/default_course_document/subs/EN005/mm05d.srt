1
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:31,769
And now we are going on the physical level to see on a different system what Aurum can produce.

2
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:41,199
What situations we can face on physical level. We've been talking about mostly emotional and mental level so far.

3
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,770
Now we're going to see what Aurum is producing on a physical level.

4
00:00:49,710 --> 00:01:05,649
The first thing that we know about Aurum is that pains in general bring on such despair that patients want to commit suicide, under the pain.

5
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:18,149
Again the same thing. There are terrible headaches, severe arthritic pains, colic pains in  the abdomen.

6
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:35,749
All these pains will lead the person to commit suicide. As we have said, pains drive the person to destruction, to commit suicide.

7
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:47,809
The pains are deep, boring type which are aggravated in the night. In the night they become much worse.

8
00:01:47,890 --> 00:02:03,529
It's very interesting that we know Aurum is a syphilitic remedy and we know the syphilitic pains which come in the night, aggravated in the night.

9
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:19,330
But the whole structure and pathology of Aurum is perhaps an expression of the Syphilis that was injected and eventually suppressed in the human body.

10
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:31,450
We have today so many cases of syphilitic aberrations of the type of Aurum.

11
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:48,119
If you do practice for a long time and you practice in this way, you will see Aurum appearing quite frequently.

12
00:02:48,200 --> 00:03:03,239
As you treat somebody during the treatment, when the syphilitic layer is coming up, you will many times see Aurum coming in the life of the person.

13
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:20,279
I have seen it quite frequently, I cannot quote exactly percentages but I would say 10% or even more of your cases will need one time or another.

14
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:36,239
During their treatment they will need Aurum. It is the syphilitic miasm which is coming eventually. It might be the first or second or third or fourth remedy but it's going to be quite frequently.

15
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:45,459
So syphilitic pains are aggravated during night obliging the patient to get up and walk.

16
00:03:52,050 --> 00:04:02,719
Kent describes the reactions of Aurum to weather and I would like to quote from him. He says, there is one grand feature running through the Aurum state.

17
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:14,959
It is the manner in which he is affected by temperature and by the weather. Here are some symptoms that relate to the whole man which must be examined in this connection.

18
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:29,559
Desire for open air. This patient resembles Pulsatilla. Just to temperature but Aurum is not mild, gentle and yielding.

19
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,659
He is obstinate, irascible, the very opposite of the Pulsatilla patient.

20
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:49,119
I would have to say here of course we cannot confuse a Pulsatilla case with an Aurum case.

21
00:04:49,200 --> 00:05:02,719
But when it comes to the imbecility state, when the pathology has progressed so much, we may see the same kind of silent brooding that we see in Pulsatilla.

22
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:30,676
Pulsatilla can have such an effect on a person that he goes into a state of total imbecility. He can't perceive, he can't talk, he can't eat, he cannot perform any function.

23
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:43,749
He just sits there for days after days and then you tell him to sit there, he sits there. You put some food in the mouth, Pulsatilla she will eat.

24
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:55,999
When Aurum reaches that state he may look some kind of similar but before that state he is completely a different person all together.

25
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:05,509
And the history of Pulsatilla and the history of Aurum are completely different histories, when you take down the history.

26
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:32,729
In connection with headaches, local, cold water ameliorates pain in the eyes. While the general situation is like Pulsatilla, that wants cool air, cold application ameliorates the headaches or the eye pains.

27
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:40,409
Averse to uncover, he doesn't want to uncover but desires open air.

28
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:59,310
And many symptoms of Aurum may disappear after cold washing. Therefore we have a general amelioration from cool bathing.

29
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:09,100
Another amelioration we have is from  music.

30
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:33,089
Music ameliorates the pains and the states on Aurum. What kind of music? They like classical music, serious music let us say.

31
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:56,079
We have another remedy which is ameliorated by music which is Tarentula. What kind of music? Rock and Roll, rhythmic strong music.

32
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:09,929
I've been described by a patient, he says I like music. How strong? He says so strong that the doors vibrate.

33
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:31,919
Therefore music ameliorates. It's not music ameliorates, it's something else behind the music. In Tarentula there is almost a physical amelioration from the vibration of sound.

34
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:39,439
It's something which brings about a circulation, maybe regulates the circulation of I don't know.

35
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:57,079
In Aurum it is a sad music, it is like Homeopathy. It is a sad music playing inside and a sad music playing outside and that ameliorates the sadness, the headaches, the pains.

36
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:11,599
That's why we have amelioration from music. One of the two remedies, you will see it in Repertory, the two capital remedies Tarentula and Aurum.

37
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:34,006
Also amelioration from walking in the open air. You will see another amelioration which appeals to the romantic nature, sensitive nature of Aurum, which is amelioration in the moonlight.

38
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:47,216
Music, moonlight, walking in the open air, soft music, you have to understand that every remedy has a logic.

39
00:09:47,290 --> 00:10:04,310
It's not just symptoms thrown there. There is a logic behind. We cannot many times understand this logic behind the symptomatology. We may not be able to perceive it but we try.

40
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:22,246
Walking in the open air and better in the evening. The time that the sun goes down until darkness, that time there is a soothing inside the Aurum depression.

41
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:49,280
The depression is so heavy and by the time the sun goes down, as soon as darkness comes, the darkness which is inside, the contrast with the darkness outside it seems to ameliorate. It has more energy, less sadness, less depression.

42
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:08,776
It affects the lymphatic and glandular system by producing congestions, indurations and tumors in these glands.

43
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:25,626
We find lumps in the mammary glands. The ovaries and the testes are affected.

44
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:54,115
And it affects the heart because the heart is the symbolic organ for the emotions. Now the emotions have been suffering, eventually they will be localized in the heart and we have all kinds of heart affections and problems.

45
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:09,276
You see you have the impression that I bring another Materia Medica, it is not. It's the information which is there, which was there, which I saw in the patients and put it together.

46
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,170
That's all. It's not another Materia Medica.

47
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:28,326
Also it has rheumatic affections with swelling of joints, quite strong.

48
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:53,406
Many times these rheumatic affections, joint affections end up in heart problems.

49
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:05,300
We have angina pectoris, enlargement of the heart, problems with valves.

50
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,740
And we have thickening and induration of the periosteum.

51
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:45,226
In the head we have a specific kind of headache. It is located in a small area. The size of a coin. And mostly on the left base.

52
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,990
And of course we have trigeminal neuralgias.

53
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:15,486
The headaches are so strong that many times we have this impulse to commit suicide during the headaches, especially in this type of headache.

54
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:31,166
With one point, it's a point that you touch it with your thumb, like that and the pain is so severe that drives him to commit suicide.

55
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:48,966
Also don't forget that you may get alternating states of headaches  with depression. This kind of headaches, severe headaches for a period of time, 6 months, 1 year, 3 years headaches.

56
00:14:49,040 --> 00:15:07,726
And then suddenly the headaches leave and the depression appears and the depression is deep and heavy. Then the headaches reappear and the depression goes on the background and on the front is the terrible headaches.

57
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:20,320
The head feels as if it is bruised.

58
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:41,706
Many times they have to cover the place of the headache, otherwise they feel air is going through the head. Painful air is going through the head.

59
00:15:45,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Occipital headaches which are connected with cases of heart problems. During the headaches there are flushes of heat to the head, making the face red and shiny.

60
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:30,246
We also have loss of hair. Scalp, very sensitive to touch. Exostosis on the scalp and also boils of the scalp.

61
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:58,596
Vertigo on stooping and tendency to fall to the left. Vertigo which has to lie down in order to relieve it.

62
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:12,846
Worse motion and this vertigo many times is associated with sparks in the eyes.

63
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:37,576
In the eyes we have ulcerations and infiltrations of the various courtings of the eye.

64
00:17:39,640 --> 00:18:05,336
Inflammation of the conjunctiva with burning heat and lacrimation which is ameliorated, this is keynote, in the moonlight.

65
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:14,840
Photophobia.

66
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:39,566
Kent made a very important remark while
 he was lecturing on Aurum to his students.

67
00:18:39,640 --> 00:19:01,140
He said, I'm going to read to you now from the eye. I'm going now to read to you from the books, he says, on the eye but remember the constitution that we must always have in view .

68
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:18,246
 I'm trying to give you in the Materia Medica, what is peculiar to Aurum, as much as possible.

69
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:26,326
What I'm reading you is not peculiar only to Aurum. We had to have that constitution as well.

70
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:45,106
Otherwise it's difficult to differentiate because Argentum Nitricum has ulcerations of the conjunctiva, of the cornea, Medorrhinum has it. It's not only Aurum which has it.

71
00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:05,400
Deep internal diseases of the eyes like iritis. Chorioretinitis and glaucoma.

72
00:20:05,474 --> 00:20:18,390
 With pain from inside outwards, worse when there is pressure. When you touch it.

73
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:24,790
And better in closing the eyes.

74
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:51,896
 Double vision. One object seems to be mixed with another. Object seems jumbled up, cannot distinguish them, black spots, sparks, flames etc.

75
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:26,130
The upper half of the vision is lost. And this condition is found mostly in detachment of the retina. Protrusion of eyes, as we find in exophthalmus. With enlargement of the heart.

76
00:21:49,870 --> 00:22:14,796
I will read you a small piece from Kent just to show you, the pictures that they used to see by his time and how these pictures have changed to much more what I describe as a mental-emotional picture.

77
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:33,005
We're not going to see these pictures. Kent says, the bones of the nose necrose. Syphilitic necrosis. The nose flattens down.

78
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:50,146
The bones are discharged. You see these people walking about with flattened down nose and if you get near enough to them, the stench will be observed.

79
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:58,856
They are nearly all syphilitics. A few remedies have the power of curing this syphilitic condition.

80
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:23,126
You see this description we will not find today. But it is interesting we don't see it but we see the alcoholism, the perversion, all the picture that I have been discussing.

81
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:37,940
Sour, bitter taste in mouth is a keynote. Syphilitic ulcers in the mouth esp. on palate.

82
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:13,726
We see in Aurum children, when the sexual instinct has just been aroused, at puberty and the hormonal system changes, the children may experience and complain for violent palpitations.

83
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:36,080
Flushes of heat which are followed by perspiration and palpitations.

84
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:55,826
Palpitations with great anxiety, almost agony and fear that I have a serious heart disease. Aurum is one of the remedies that has fear of heart disease.

85
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:15,816
When the disease is affecting Aurum on a physical level, we may not have so much the suicidal depression but we get the physical pains, the physical symptoms, the palpitations, the flushing of heat etc.

86
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:23,630
At the same time a fear that I have a severe heart disease.

87
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:42,006
Rheumatic pains end up in the heart, severe dyspnea with the involvement of the heart, endocarditis, with high fever and aversion to be even touched in the chest.

88
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:51,846
With endocarditis we have that peculiarity that the person, if you  go to examine even and put the stethoscope, he will not want to be touched.

89
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:59,680
He feels this is a big pressure, if you put it he feels it as a great pressure.

90
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Many times the depression of Aurum, as we said, it's so strong and he does not talk at all. But in the night during sleep, he is sobbing.

91
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:44,500
-Only the children?
-No, the grown ups, everybody.

92
00:26:50,640 --> 00:27:08,566
It is like the psyche is crying. When the logical mind leaves, cannot control anymore, the psyche is sobbing, is crying deeply.

93
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:37,970
We have dyspnea, worse laughing and worse at night and from warm air. Cannot lie down because of his dyspnea.

94
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:53,690
Now sexually how he behaves?

95
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,696
Sexually the Aurum patient is very active and passionate.

96
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:17,926
As he finds sex  an outlet to his emotional difficulties and inability of expression.

97
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:33,166
But as he has been hurt once, it's only the pleasure of physical contact with no emotional attachment and pleasure whatsoever.

98
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:49,846
He detaches himself emotionally and he enjoys physical sex. He is very passionate in physical sex but once the physical sex has ended, has finished, there is no connection.

99
00:28:49,920 --> 00:29:11,240
The person is some stranger but he can be again very easily excited and quite passionate. The moment the orgasm comes he does not want to see the person, there is no connection, there is no feelings.

100
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:33,246
So the lack of emotional investment in his relationships, can lead him to have multiple contacts, without any really deep investment or satisfaction.

101
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:41,326
These people they seem to need frequent sexual contacts to balance their depression.

102
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:54,916
This situation eventually will deepen his depression. Because such contacts are not satisfying, they're just superficial and he needs this excitement

103
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:04,576
he goes for that but when the whole set is finished, then he is back to his depression and even worse.

104
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:19,890
Because he realizes again and again that there is no possibility of a deeper connection, of a deeper feeling of exchange, of love and affection.

105
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:39,906
Another characteristic is that in case where the sexual partner lets them down first, they are so devastated that they are ready to go

106
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:47,846
 to extremes of depression and even suicide in spite of the fact that they have no real attachment to the other person.

107
00:30:49,920 --> 00:31:10,906
He says, 'I didn't like her'. Then why so much reaction? It is the egotism who has been hurt. The egotistical element of Aurum that has been hurt.

108
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:19,326
And also women are very sensitive beings and they understand where a man is hurt and they can hurt.

109
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:31,590
The expressions that they will use is, 'this man is too serious, I can't stand him anymore'. The woman says, 'bye, bye I'm leaving'.

110
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:50,796
The Aurum is not attached to that woman. He could say, talking to his friends, 'I could leave her anytime'. The moment that the woman says to him that this relationship is finished, then he is devastated, he goes straight to suicide.

111
00:31:50,870 --> 00:32:02,556
But why suicide? You were saying you did not care about that woman, he does not understand himself. It is the hurt egoism which is behind.

112
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:15,736
It's not that he cares about that person and therefore he will commit suicide now which is again another thing with Natrum sulphuricum or Natrum muriaticum.

113
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:24,246
They may have such tendency. They care about the others, they have feelings. He does not have feelings.

114
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:46,416
In another occasion you may meet a married man who is disappointed from his work, Aurum case.

115
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:57,720
And he is progressing towards a depression who cannot be aroused anymore by his wife.

116
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:05,806
And he seeks excitement outside of his marriage where he behaves very passionately sexually.

117
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:18,326
Eventually as there is no deeper involvement, he is less and less aroused by this affair outside.

118
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:26,326
What is going to happen? He will let this affair go away and he will search for another affair.

119
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:49,046
And in time he will have the desire to have sex but not the capacity, he will become impotent.

120
00:33:49,120 --> 00:34:00,846
That is how we have impotency in Aurum. Impotency in Aurum does not come just like that. It's a process.

121
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:15,566
Why Aurum is so sexually excited easily and then it becomes impotent, this is the process. No internal connection, physical contact, a lot of excitement

122
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:22,646
then another affair, then again another affair, he finds himself impotent.

123
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,326
Sometimes Aurum patients will resort to masturbation in order to relieve the pressure.

124
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:40,076
But the sense that they are doing something wrong, complicates matters and eventually makes the depression worse.

125
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:47,726
You see in order to get out of the depression, they go to masturbation. Masturbation for them is not right.

126
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:54,246
Again the right ideas, the right things. This makes the depression eventually worse.

127
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:12,336
We have masturbation in young men who are very shy, introvert and they have inferiority complexes towards women.

128
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:19,336
Such young men they may not even consider the possibility of a relationship.

129
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:33,660
The possibility of real human contact is completely remote. You understand how they feel? How isolated they feel inside these young men?

130
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,806
-Are Aurum women?

131
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:35,860
-Much more men than women. I don't know why but much more men. I've seen similar things with women but definitely with much more men.

132
00:36:55,110 --> 00:37:11,086
We must be aware that the sexual behavior, the sexual contacts of the human beings are many times determined by their pathology.

133
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:25,606
And that is why it is very difficult to change and even moral people may behave very immorally.

134
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:40,706
And that is why also, that we that understand the pathology in this way, it is better not to criticize what we see.

135
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:52,526
Many times we criticize without understanding a problem. And we pass judgment and criticism and we say all kinds of things.

136
00:37:52,600 --> 00:38:06,964
As homeopaths, understanding the human nature in the way that we should and pathology in the way we should understand it, we should be able to comprehend why a person behaves this way or another way.

137
00:38:07,064 --> 00:38:13,680
Especially in matters of that intimacy which is the sexual matters.

138
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:35,706
And not pass judgment, being critical about such contacts. It's better if we are able to do something about it and correct such behavior than criticism which has no meaning.

139
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:46,206
Why men more than women? Most probably because men were much more influenced by Syphilis than women.

140
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:08,816
We have nightly  emission, we have young boys whose testes have not descended.

141
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,126
And who of course portray the Aurum characteristics.

142
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:26,446
Atrophy of the testicles and in these cases we'll find individuals with a kind of hypochondriasis.

143
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:36,280
Isolated, looking upon little things and magnifying them.

144
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:55,386
Enlargement of the right testicle, induration is underlined very much. One of the main remedies for induration of the testes. Epididymitis, orchitis, balanitis and sarcosel.

145
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:01,376
In the female we have induration and ulceration of the uterus.

146
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:14,890
These indurations, these fibromas are much more prominent of course in Aurum muriaticum natronatum, as we said before.

147
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:27,046
The menses are late and scanty or they are completely absent in which case deep depression may appear.

148
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:39,076
The menses go less and less, the depression becomes more and more, there is no menses, big depression. This is a serious situation.

149
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:48,396
It's very interesting if we observe, for me it's something very fascinating.

150
00:40:48,470 --> 00:41:04,446
We observe the emotions how they withdraw, they become hard and you see at the same time  the genitalia becoming hard, withdrawn, do not descend.

151
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:29,097
The organs through which we have contact, as I said before, which is the emotions and the genitalia also. These are the deepest contact, the two areas through which we establish contact with the others.

152
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:43,770
In Aurum they are both shrunk, not descended, hard, indurated. That's the idea of Aurum.

153
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:59,116
-Do I find that Aurum is associated with a group of people or countries?

154
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:13,570
-Well I would say that northern countries will have quite a lot of Aurum.

155
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:27,916
 I would expect that England would have quite a lot. I would expect Sweden, Norway and Finland they will have quite a lot.

156
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:41,320
Now with a group of people I would say, not the basic people. You see it's very difficult to find an Aurum man who is a farmer.

157
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:52,326
 Difficult to find but very easy to find a lawyer, an engineer, an educated person.

158
00:42:52,400 --> 00:43:05,286
A person who works with his mind much more than others. The more educated class, the more sophisticated class.

159
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:17,776
But towards the North also is like that. People are mentalized, more living with their heads, not with their hearts.

160
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:32,080
And then you get the other pole. In Africa people live with their hearts, not with their heads, at all. It's only the Greeks who are in the middle.

161
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:11,646
It's a good question. Jf we have a constitutional Aurum, do we have to be careful in treating such case?

162
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:18,576
I'll give you an example. Let us say, somebody comes to be treated. You realize he's an Aurum case.

163
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:29,046
He confesses to you that he has a lot of suicidal impulses, not only suicidal impulses, he has attempted suicide.

164
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:34,316
He just doesn't want to live, he wants to commit suicide and he is definite about it.

165
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:51,126
In such a case it is best for the first few days after the treatment to either tell the family or the person with the family that they should take special care with this.

166
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:58,636
The more dangerous it is, the more you see he may commit suicide moment to moment, you just lock him in a room, after all.

167
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:07,520
You say, you lock yourself inside a room for 3 days and take the remedy. I mean you go to extremes but I think we had a case

168
00:45:07,594 --> 00:45:26,626
 the doctor is here who had such a case and we actually locked him inside the house. We said, you have to be locked for 3 days, stay inside the house, close the windows, close the doors and the family will know.

169
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:35,206
Not because I believe maybe the aggravation will go and then he will jump, I don't believe so much in that.

170
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:52,686
What I believe is that before Aurum acts, there is a time....you must not forget that a sick person has taken all around him, everybody into his sickness.

171
00:45:52,760 --> 00:46:03,856
That means the manipulation by the person, the handling of the other persons around the sick person has taken a pattern.

172
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:11,126
Now you come into that pattern where there is a whole family, where the depressed man living there has certain pattern.

173
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:24,546
You come into the picture and you say, take this. Open your mouth, take this. What you're doing, you're breaking patterns, family patterns that they have been established through years.

174
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:35,926
How a change in that person may affect everybody around, what comments they may say, what things can happen?

175
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:48,376
So we try to prevent as much as possible having an accident, because it's a matter of an accident.

176
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:58,276
Maybe the Aurum is not acted yet and then the person goes and jump. He has tried 2 times and now this time succeeds.

177
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:10,120
Would you say to yourself, would you ask yourself whether that was because of the remedy you gave or not? Yes you will have a problem. Why you should have the problem?

178
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:30,126
And I have heard some other people saying, I had a case, it was a suicidal case, it was a Sulphur case, so I gave him Sulphur and next 3 days he committed suicide.

179
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:48,836
Now you hear that and you say, god a remedy can make him commit suicide. I am very skeptical about it because what I say is that this person was not Sulphur.

180
00:47:48,910 --> 00:48:03,006
It was Natrum sulphuricum or Natrum muriaticum or Aurum and you gave Sulphur and he felt even this doctor cannot cure me and he jumps.

181
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:17,996
Why it is because of Sulphur? It is because you did not give the right remedy. So the idea is to prevent if something like that happens.

182
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:30,326
You go and see an Aurum case, it's a serious case. It's the type of person who really does it. Who can commit suicide. You have to take that into consideration. This is an Aurum case, he may do that anytime.

183
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:40,490
What time? Maybe the day after I gave him Aurum and then you have it in your conscience. It's better you lock him up.

184
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,646
-Does Aurum has compulsive thoughts?

185
00:48:52,740 --> 00:49:01,326
-In a way we can say yes, he has compulsive thoughts but the thoughts are towards self-destruction.

186
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:19,586
I'm sure you all have people that you imagine they can be.

187
00:49:50,400 --> 00:50:04,366
It's a very interesting question, the difference between a Causticum anarchist and an  Aurum anarchist. It's totally different.

188
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:22,116
Causticum we say it's the primary anarchist in the Materia Medica. We would like to differentiate between Aurum and Causticum.

189
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:29,096
Well, we'll do it. I'll take my last extra strength.

190
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:56,786
Causticum is full of feelings and he feels for the other person. The emotions also are very serious but the seriousness is intense.

191
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:19,866
He is always like that, very serious, what happened? This man hit him, he will jump and kill the man that hit the other person. He was a weak person. He is full of passion of sympathy.

192
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:36,446
Full of sympathetic feelings for those who are suffering, for those who are under pressure, under a regime who is suppressing them.

193
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:50,796
He is some person who is always looking for injustice. Everywhere he will see injustice, even if there is no injustice, he will see injustice.

194
00:51:50,870 --> 00:52:06,056
Because he wants to see injustice, it is his nature. He says, I can't tolerate injustice and they have their own code of ethics, their own understanding of injustice.

195
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:19,936
For them it is injustice perhaps if you throw a stone to a dog and it's not injustice if you throw it to a man.

196
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:34,706
The idea is that he is going to find all the time injustice in animals, injustice in men, whatever is his particular, but the feelings are so strong.

197
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:46,206
He will go to anarchism because he cannot anymore tolerate the suppression of this government. The suppression of people.

198
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:51,706
How does it suppress? I saw it. But how did you see it?

199
00:52:52,960 --> 00:53:10,376
I saw a man that he wanted to hold a red flag and somebody told him not to do it. He should be able to do it, he is suppressed.

200
00:53:10,450 --> 00:53:20,866
They find a way to almost perceive everything as suppression. You see the intensity in the feelings.

201
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:36,606
Aurum is cool. Everything is inside. Injustice yes, this world is unjust, I will tell them, I must find a way to bring back justice.

202
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:53,406
It is a mentalized process, a playing with death to bring justice but in a completely different manner, completely different set up inside pathology.

203
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,266
Do you see the difference?

204
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:10,936
Causticum is one of the main remedies to be sympathetic. It says Phosphorus sympathetic. Phosphorus suffers very much for the others.

205
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:22,586
Will he ever become anarchist? No, why? Because he is soft inside, in his emotions. Causticum is intense.

206
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:31,606
And always there is an intensity in their eyes, in their look.

207
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:54,388
Phosphorus are very sympathetic especially if one is suffering really. Causticum does not have to suffer really. He may imagine that you are suffering and he goes against and he wants to take action.

208
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:05,486
Phosphorus will feel first that you're suffering, that you have the pain and then he will try to help.

209
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:15,856
He will think of something to help you at this moment, he will not think of breaking down the government because you are suffering.

210
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:23,406
He has a heart attack, yes because he is suppressed. He is so much suppressed by the government, he has a heart attack now.

211
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:37,426
But he does not do anything for his heart attack. He is sympathetic, but the anarchist, his mind will go further.

212
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:49,856
Of course we have the sympathetic element in which a person can cry. For instance in the hospital.

213
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:08,786
In another bed somebody is suffering, a Phosphorus case inside the room, they will leave, they cannot stand it.

214
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:20,040
Their imagination is exaggerating what they are feeling. They cannot tolerate that.

215
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:35,126
They can stay awake and sleep will not come, that's the sympathetic element towards the pain of others.

216
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:51,120
But Causticum progresses towards. It's a weak person, we have to help this person because it's suppressed. That is the anarchist.

217
00:56:53,360 --> 00:57:00,380
So for tonight I think it's enough.
