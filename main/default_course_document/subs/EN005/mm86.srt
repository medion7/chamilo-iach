1
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:31,549
How many people have prescribed
Ran-b. so far in your practice?

2
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:54,959
It's not a remedy that is indicated very frequently but many cases which are going untreated, many times they need Ran-b.

3
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:10,379
we don't realize it and instead of Ran-b. we give other remedies. Which bring around a kind of
 cure but it's not the right one.

4
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:23,989
It will take quite a long time if you give a similar remedy than when you give the correct one to bring about a cure.

5
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:33,889
I was also giving Ran-b. for intercostal
neuralgia when it was on the left side.

6
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:52,039
And almost that was the only thing that was working until I realized the type of person that
 will need Ran-b.

7
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:04,252
Once you try one or two remedies before Ran-b. then more and more comes clear the idea of Ran-b., then you can prescribe it.

8
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,840
So I want to give you this
experience with such persons.

9
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:32,919
I'll try to epitomize the impressions and I would say that people that they need Ran-b., are touchy, discontented and angry inside.

10
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:43,729
Touchy means persons who are closed and easily hurt, very easily offended, very easily.

11
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:52,299
They appear to have a constant discontent inside them, discontented and easily offended.

12
00:02:52,300 --> 00:03:09,289
The word touchy is very fitting for them. They appear to be weak and to seek help, to ask for help.

13
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:30,429
They seem to be very respectful of other people, they are proper. So they are sensitive, touchy, easily offended, there is a kind of discontent.

14
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:41,720
And they will seek help in a particular way because their remedy most probably will not be realized.

15
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:50,029
You will be giving different remedies, Ars., sometimes Sulph., sometimes Rhus-t., sometimes Dulc.

16
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,880
All these remedies they have
 some similarities with Ran-b.

17
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,879
There is a characteristic of Ran-b.

18
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:16,469
When they come to seek help, they have a kind of respect that is given to the great Professor, Mr. Professor.

19
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:32,969
That respect, I don't know how it's called in your own language but great respect from a proper person.

20
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:43,950
'Will you please look my case? It's not that I'm not happy with the treatment exactly but some things are not going right

21
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:55,059
 and I would like very much, if it is possible
 for you just to have a look in my case.

22
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:11,849
And I very much appreciate your time; I know you are very busy and I have all this and...' he is seeking for help in a very respectful manner.

23
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:31,220
When you get to know them better, then they are very touchy. Great respect but the moment you say something that offends them a little bit

24
00:05:31,221 --> 00:05:39,309
or you may not expect to be offended at all,
they get so much offended, they go to pieces.

25
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:52,349
I will give you an example. I recently had a
case and I was impressed by his reaction.

26
00:05:52,350 --> 00:06:12,969
I asked a favor from him. I said, will you be able to tape, to make a copy of that, he is an expert in making copies and then I changed my mind.

27
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:27,219
I'll tell my secretary, I want more copies, give it to professional people. So I told him I don't need it anymore, it's OK.

28
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:52,379
He went to pieces. 'Why not? Did I say something that showed that I did not want to do it?', 'No, no it's OK, we just decided to give it outside'. Please...

29
00:06:52,380 --> 00:07:00,549
This kind of respect which is too
 much, which is going too far.

30
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:20,580
Now what happens with them is when they come to that state, the Ranunculus state, they have a kind of weakness and dullness in the mind

31
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:31,499
that makes them averse to undertaking further responsibilities. What they do the absolutely necessary, it is OK.

32
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:40,859
 Once you tell them a little bit more, that little bit more becomes too much for them and they cannot perform it, they cannot do it.

33
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:57,439
There is a sense inside them, they are too weak, too sick, too unprepared in their body, in their physical fitness to take up some further responsibility.

34
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,017
And it is very interesting that very sensitive,
very touchy, very easily offended, why?

35
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:11,860
Because they think that they are very good in what they're doing; yet if a superior says to them

36
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:25,640
you have a future in our affair or you have a future in the school where you teach, there is a future in the bank where you are would you like that we promote you?

37
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:33,849
You take some more responsibility.
 They will say, 'no please, I don't want it'.

38
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:42,320
They feel inside them that they are too sick.

39
00:08:43,950 --> 00:09:02,169
 'I have this headache which comes, indescribable headaches' and you get sometimes this cervical syndrome coming from osteophytes in the cervical region.

40
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:12,849
The circulation on the brain seems to be obstructed and there is a kind of dizziness, confusion, dullness and they are in a state of

41
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:21,159
'I'm not well. Mr. Professor, please'.
That kind of attitude.

42
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:28,139
You get eventually the idea that they are
very anxious inside concerning their health.

43
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:35,620
Because you take their case and they
say, OK headaches, stiffness etc.

44
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:51,019
But everybody may have headaches and stiffness but in their work they like to go forward, to be promoted. Why don't you?

45
00:09:51,020 --> 00:10:04,139
He says, 'I don't feel well, I can't take much responsibility. I know it's very great for me. I can be promoted tremendously but I cannot do it'.

46
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:14,889
'Do you have anxiety? Do you feel really that you have cancer?', 'No'. They do not have anxiety of having cancer or a particular disease.

47
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:30,299
It's a kind of hypochondriasis almost where they just don't feel well. They may be coming again and again and you feel that this is a mental case almost with this kind of hypochondriasis.

48
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:38,600
It is not a big deal what you are telling me, the symptoms. The laboratory examinations will show nothing.

49
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:47,619
There is no real pathology underneath to account for this kind of behavior. Why is he behaving like that?

50
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,279
This is because he is Ran-b.

51
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:59,799
This is the idea. Another individual all together. How touchy they are, how offended they are and how respectful.

52
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:10,289
All this respect they expect you give it to them. You treat them with the same kind of respect.
If you don't, they become offended.

53
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:28,949
You will confuse that again with Nux-v. because they behave in this way, in their work, outside, in the society but once they are at home, most of the time they behave like that.

54
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:40,569
But there are some moments where the angriness is so great that it is released completely at a certain moment.

55
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:58,383
And there is such a fit of anger that I have been described as taking the child from here, lifting the child, with the idea to throw the child on the ground.

56
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:11,399
That was the fit of the anger. We have to treat the child, we have to give remedies to the child after this shock.

57
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:26,439
You see you don't get the idea because you are not familiar with the remedy. And you give Nux-v., you give Ars....

58
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:35,719
Because properness is another quality of Ran-b. They want to be proper. Everything they do it properly.

59
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:44,219
They bring you their cases very well written.
 The symptoms in a line.

60
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:53,905
You get the idea that most probably he is an Ars. because you see the hypochondriasis. But the restlessness is missing.

61
00:12:54,780 --> 00:13:09,629
The fear of death is missing. They don't care about death. What they care is just this kind of dizziness, headache... 'could you please help me? I cannot work'.

62
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:19,679
We miss that case. I remember cases later on, when I understood Ran-b., I remember cases where I have missed them, giving all kinds of remedies.

63
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:27,509
Cimic., Rhus-t., Calc-p., Calc., Kali's... nothing.

64
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:37,299
He would come with this respect and say, oh my god 10 years ago I had that case and it was a typical Ran-b. and I lost the case.

65
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:44,169
When I realized eventually what
is the type of Ran-b.

66
00:13:49,160 --> 00:14:01,369
With those around them, very aggressive sometimes, beyond the normal reaction.

67
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:14,589
The child maybe shrieking, playing or making a lot of noise but still it's not that you grab the child and you throw it down.

68
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:30,959
And the touchy element. It will go into the physical almost. When they have a pain, touch aggravates the pain. They don't like to be touched.

69
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:47,249
They don't like to touch any point which is painful, whether it is a pain in the spleen, in the liver, in the chest, in herpes zoster, intercostal  neuralgia, whatever is the pain they don't like to be touched.

70
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:59,689
And yet also they are very sensitive to air, to open air or to cold water or to draft.

71
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:17,749
They will go out and they will have clothes and if a little bit of air goes through, immediately the pain becomes worse, immediately they feel miserable.

72
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,919
They have to be covered very well.

73
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,240
In Ran-b. we have an
 aggravation from alcohol.

74
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:49,409
There is a strong symptom of alcohol. Aggravation from alcohol, especially the headaches, one of the main characteristics.

75
00:15:49,410 --> 00:16:06,100
Yet I have found in Ran-b. cases a kind of aversion to alcohol or rather because they want to be proper, to do everything properly

76
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:14,669
and alcohol is no good to drink, they want to be proper and in socializing they say 'No. I'm not going to have alcohol'.

77
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:23,789
You wonder why he does not have alcohol. Sometimes because he is aggravated by alcohol, sometimes because of this proper element which is in them.

78
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:33,120
They want to appear proper, not doing something bad. It's very important, all this respect, 'Look how proper I am

79
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:39,659
and what do I ask you? Just a little bit of headache. I just want to get out this headache.

80
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:48,679
I'm so nice, I' m doing everything properly, I'm doing everything well'. This is the type of person.

81
00:16:52,710 --> 00:17:01,179
The confusion of the head is as if they have drunk wine, as if they are intoxicated.

82
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:15,030
Even they have a great sexual appetite.
 Great sexual desire.

83
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:29,949
But they do not express it, they will not. In a sexual intercourse, they will behave properly.

84
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:40,500
The sexual desire is great but the behavior is proper. That means they will never speak, they will never make sounds.

85
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:49,799
You see that proper element that goes through and you get the story.

86
00:17:49,800 --> 00:18:03,079
You will be puzzled with such cases and then you will ask the wife, you will ask the children and you will get all the information finally. And you will say here is a Ran-b. case.

87
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:24,229
We're dealing unfortunately with human organism which are alive and all the time playing. It is like an energy which is floating, flowing. It's not a machine which is fixed.

88
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:37,209
 All this sage, this understanding has to be taken into consideration before you can really do high standard Homeopathy.

89
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:45,269
Before you can really have results
on a steady basis, on a high percentage.

90
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:56,359
Otherwise you hit here and there sometimes a remedy, you get very excited, Puls. Everybody can recognize Puls. and Lach.

91
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:12,199
Sometimes Hyos. is mistaken for Lach. because of that reason, because of talking and you get excited.

92
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,719
And you really see the possibilities of Homeopathy. But unless you learn these little remedies that you will need ...

93
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:28,399
One day you will need Ran-b., the next day you will need another small remedy like Dol.

94
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:34,109
You have to know all of them.
This is very unfortunate.

95
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:48,740
Again another element is inferiority complex.

96
00:19:49,020 --> 00:20:02,619
They will give you the impression with inferiority complex, yet deep down they believe that they do very properly and very well whatever they have to do.

97
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:20,239
Also they seem to worry quite a lot about the future, their own future, the future of their family, their children.

98
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,130
And when they talk to you, they will say
'yes. I have my children, what shall I do?

99
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:34,599
 I have to have enough money to live with them because if it's something happens to me they must have money to live', etc.

100
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,840
But they will do nothing to promote their job.

101
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:54,589
Why? Because they do not have the energy. They feel that they are very sick and they cannot work, they cannot do more than what they are doing.

102
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:24,919
More or less this is the type. Then we have the intercostal neuralgia of the left side, which is worse touch, worse in the air, worse in the wet, worse taking a cold bath.

103
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:33,679
In the summer, for instance, they will not go to the sea and have a bath, if they have any kind of pain.

104
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:44,239
The pain is aggravated tremendously by taking a bath in the sea. It's not the sea that aggravates, it's the cold.

105
00:21:45,000 --> 00:22:04,839
A characteristic pain of Ran-b. also is a round kind of pain, around the chest like a big spot, which is very painful, very burning and is worse from any kind of cold or draft.

106
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:15,829
The pain can be superficial, can be on the muscles or the pain can be felt deep into the lungs.

107
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:37,959
Together with this pain usually there is a malaise feeling all over the body that gives the impression that they are really sick.

108
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:51,199
There is another peculiar pain that you will get in Ran-b. in the back on the dorsal region, next to the scapula.

109
00:22:51,200 --> 00:23:01,509
When they do little movement,
when a woman is knitting.

110
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:22,349
They do a lot of this and immediately there is a stabbing pain next to the spinal cord and between the spinal cord and the scapula.

111
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:27,939
It is just a spot, a pain on a spot there.

112
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:38,249
That pain can be also with another remedy
you have to remember about that, it's Puls.

113
00:23:44,660 --> 00:24:01,430
And if this pain is on the upper angle of the scapula on the left side, between the beginning of the dorsal region and the end of the cervical.

114
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:07,409
Next to the upper angle of the scapula, it is Rhus-t.

115
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:22,315
But if the pain is as if your finger, put the finger right on top, exactly on that spot, they will say, that pain there...

116
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:29,199
Just as much as it is a finger, that is Kali-bi.

117
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:04,269
Extreme weakness, tiredness beyond
the pathology is a characteristic.

118
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:15,709
The time of aggravation for
Ran-b. is in the evening.

119
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:49,629
The aggravation from cold air, from wet, from cold bathing will bring to the mind usually the Dulc.

120
00:25:50,400 --> 00:26:03,479
It will bring to the mind with this pain of the back, Rhus-t. But you will not have the restlessness of Rhus-t. and the type of Dulc. is another type all together.

121
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:10,299
They are not this type at all. They are
quite authoritative, another type.

122
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:28,219
There is an anxiety also which is felt in the
chest, especially in the evening and night.

123
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:39,729
And a general feeling of coldness in
chest is a characteristic of Ran-b.

124
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:55,079
This coldness can be aggravated, either by cold which comes from outside or from inhaling cold air.

125
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:19,139
With Ran-b. we can cure also cases of pneumonia, when we have cases of
 pneumonia and cases of bronchitis.

126
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:34,099
With this oppression of chest, the inflammation, the aggravation from inhaling cold air, the cold spots on the chest, the aggravation from cold draft.

127
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:50,809
Pain also from deep inhalation,
it's not only Bry. It's Ran-b.

128
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:30,819
Walking aggravates but again in the open air. If they walk inside a small room, the aggravation is not there. Once they go out and they walk in the open air, then comes the pain aggravation.

129
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:49,049
Also there is another point quite strong. In the books it is not stressed but I have seen it in Ran-b. quite a lot and it is censorious, critical.

130
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,999
He becomes quite
critical of others, many times.

131
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:23,360
Fear when he is alone sometimes but not strong. Fear of ghosts also sometimes, not strong again.

132
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:45,879
Also there is another element, this proper element, this seeking of health. It may lead them many times, especially when they feel quite ill and painful, they seem to not be able to tolerate pain.

133
00:29:45,880 --> 00:30:03,049
They go into meditation and try to seek solace and help from God. Which other remedy does that very strongly?

134
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:15,639
Aurum. Aurum is the main
remedy if somebody tells you...

135
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:31,019
I treated once a case of very severe
 inflammation of testes on a boy, 20-22 years old.

136
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:42,919
In India. He has been treated by all the Professors and the Colleges and many
other people. Nobody could help him.

137
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:52,289
The testes were swollen and painful.
And he had different other symptomatology.

138
00:30:52,290 --> 00:31:03,549
But the boy confessed to me that he had to pray. He says, 'I have to pray'. He was a Christian, there are some Christians in India also.

139
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:25,019
'I'm a Christian and I must pray but this is not a case that I can pray for 5-10 min. I have to pray for 1-2 hours before I go to bed. I have to do it. I can't stop it'.

140
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,327
This is the time when we have
 a symptom "praying".

141
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:47,599
It's a compulsory thing. They cannot do otherwise. They have to pray. 'God help me', constantly praying.

142
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,050
It is like something which is
completely beyond the normal.
