1
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:31,488
I will talk about Ant-c.

2
00:00:47,400 --> 00:01:07,591
Ant-c. cases are people that are very sensitive, very introverted and very sentimental.

3
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:21,520
Sentimentality actually as an excess here seals the Ant-c. patients.

4
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:36,411
The sentiments are very easily excited and the sentiments can become very powerful inside. It  can be over flowing.

5
00:01:39,630 --> 00:02:02,821
This kind of sentimentality, the easy arousal of sentiments and the sensitivity on the other hand affects these individuals mostly on the area of the solar plexus.

6
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:17,051
And we know the impact of the emotions on the solar plexus and in consequence the stomach area.

7
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:44,551
So therefore Ant-c. cases are very sensitive in the area of the stomach and the stomach will be the first one to show the imbalance, wherever it might be.

8
00:02:50,620 --> 00:03:13,400
We have to imagine these open, in the beginning, sentimental, sensitive patients that are under stress and the sentiments are becoming quite hurt. And the impact is taken on the stomach.

9
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:41,060
Under such stress they will withdraw and they will usually become sulky and will live with their imagination much more than the real contact with the real life.

10
00:03:45,560 --> 00:04:05,191
It is for that reason that when they lie in bed in the night, the sentiments will arise and they will be a strong imaginative factor that will make them over excited.

11
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:17,560
Eventually this over excitement will lead to a state of anxiety. So anxiety in the night lying down.

12
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:35,501
It is also very peculiar that when there is something going on with their health and the area which is affected is the digestive system.

13
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:47,981
If they have digestive problems, they become over sentimental. If they have fever, they become over sentimental.

14
00:04:49,880 --> 00:05:08,061
Also this sentimentality is apparent in women just before menses and of course is well known that Ant-c. is affected by moonlight.

15
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:23,551
It's the moon that represents a lot of the feelings that affects them so much, especially when they are in a sensitive state.

16
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:35,541
When something has happened in their life and they are very stressed and they will go for a walk and look at the moon and they will become almost ecstatic.

17
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:50,449
The sentimentality becomes so powerful during that time and it seems that it's connected with that mellow light that comes from the moon.

18
00:05:50,760 --> 00:06:26,181
Because they find themselves in that state of over sentimentality also when the windows are with yellow colors and light comes through these windows, that is the environment where the Ant-c. patients become anxious and excited in their emotional state.

19
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:41,751
The sentimentality of Ant-c. is so great that many times will lead them to do things which are foolish.

20
00:06:47,800 --> 00:07:06,761
Can you imagine the state where the emotions are beyond the control of the individual and lead them to do things which they look ridiculous.

21
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:32,701
Concerning Ant-c. children I have found out that they look very much like Cham. children.

22
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:56,901
They are very much aggressive, dissatisfied and complain. You will see the Ant-c. child will not be able to sleep the whole night. It will be up all the time and he will complain.

23
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:17,351
He does not know what is wrong with him and for instance the mother will say to calm the child, look at this car, it's a nice car. It's not a car.

24
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:36,271
He is not happy, he is not satisfied with anything. 'Let's go in this place where it's nice to your friend John. No! I don't want to go to John. Where do you want to go? I don't know'.

25
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:55,301
You go to the child and you try to calm the child, you want to talk to the child. You will see the reaction when you try either to touch them or to look at them, there is an immediate reaction.

26
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:08,701
The reaction is very very similar to Cham. and many times you will mistake for Cham., especially when you see the case superficially.

27
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:22,141
The Cham. state will come usually in dentition period where especially the young ones will bring the first teeth out.

28
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:42,701
The Ant-c. child can be 3,4,5 years old and still has the same reaction and you will think that he's teething . It is because something bothers him and he does not know what it is that bothers him.

29
00:09:51,680 --> 00:10:16,821
I just remembered a case of Ant-c. when I first gave this lecture this summer in Alonissos, I have just prescribed for a child that was in Alonissos, not in the group but connected with the group, I gave Cham., because of such behavior.

30
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:29,961
The child was not happy, was not satisfied, it was screaming, it had a little bit of fever and so I said OK give a dose of Cham. 30. Nothing happened.

31
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:42,031
And as I was lecturing about the remedy I remembered the child and I said the child most probably is Ant-c.

32
00:10:42,090 --> 00:11:00,891
The reason was that I have been with the parents, I have been having dinner with them and the child asked for cucumber all the time.

33
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:15,981
Cham. behavior in a child that has desire for cucumber is an Ant-c. child.

34
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:30,711
When I went out of the lecture the mother came, that same day, she said we're worrying about the child, for 4-5 days it has not slept, we have not slept  and we're here on holidays.

35
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:48,341
They were coming from England in Alonissos and his father says that unless something is done for the child, we're returning tomorrow to England. The holiday was spoiled.

36
00:11:49,360 --> 00:12:08,181
That kind of aggression. It's very difficult to find words. I refer to Cham. children because most of you must have seen some Cham. children.

37
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,941
And most of you, you will have missed like me and give Cham. instead of Ant-c.

38
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:35,291
So the child got at 10 o'clock a dose of Ant-c. 200, and by 10.30 he was asleep, in the morning and he slept and after that everything went OK.

39
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,801
Some of you, you must remember this case.

40
00:12:50,010 --> 00:13:04,181
There is also an element which is running through Ant-c. and it's a warm element which is within Ant-c.

41
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:19,001
Anything warm makes the Ant-c. worse. Whether it is something warm they drink or outside warmth or fever makes them feel worse or alcohol.

42
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:44,380
Whatever raises the temperature and it seems that they have no tolerance in raising of their temperature especially if they found themselves in front of an open fire. Then everything that they may have, is aggravated.

43
00:13:57,357 --> 00:14:18,351
Here again we have an exception where the headaches sometimes are aggravated by cold bathing. Cold water in the head may aggravate the headache.

44
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:32,671
Then they have great prostration, weakness. The weakness is quite strong and similar to Stannum.

45
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:51,621
There again in Ant-c. we find the loathing of life, we find the desire not to live, it's not a suicidal disposition, it's a desire not to live anymore because of the prostration.

46
00:14:51,680 --> 00:15:06,781
There is prostration but no restlessness. In spite of the heat, there is thirstlessness. There is no excessive thirst as one may have expected.

47
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:26,061
Sometimes they have suicidal thoughts and this is worse in the night, in bed. You will see the aggravation in the night, in bed where the anxiety rises

48
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:49,060
the sentiments are very strong and by that time some Ant-c. will think of committing suicide and the method by which they will contemplate to commit suicide is by shooting themselves. And of course especially in disappointed love.

49
00:15:50,040 --> 00:16:01,751
Ant-c. you can understand because of the sentimentality they will get attached in a love affair. They will get attached to the other person very much.

50
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:10,221
Due to that attachment they become vulnerable. The sentiments are very strong. They are attached.

51
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:22,171
The other person says, it's finished. They can't take it and that is the time usually where they seek to shoot themselves.

52
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:40,091
Actually ailments from grief, in that respect Ant-c. should be much higher. I don't remember in the Repertory how it is but if I remember well,  it's not very strong.

53
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:16,381
They develop, as we said, anxiety in the night and after midnight as well and an anxiety about their future.

54
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:36,071
They get easily discouraged, they are persons that cannot take very much the stresses of life, easily discouraged.

55
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:55,780
Fear of death sometimes, not strong but they become fearful from sudden noises.

56
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:19,031
Irritability, as we said, in the children especially and during headache the irritability of Ant-c. is very strong during headaches.

57
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:31,771
They don't like to be looked, do you know why? Can you imagine?

58
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:52,544
Because there is irritability and there is great sensitivity and the emotions are very strong and looking usually to each other it's not with great sympathy.

59
00:18:53,290 --> 00:19:14,611
And it's an indifference and they feel very vulnerable to this kind of looking. It's like as if somebody is bare, open and somebody else is looking inside him and they don't like it. And they will withdraw.

60
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:30,051
The same idea with touching the Ant-c. It's not that they feel painful if they are touched, they don't like to be touched. It is a kind of sentimental rawness.

61
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:47,141
Like Causticum feels like raw, like the skin is not there and the pain feels as if the skin is not there. Ant-c. feel as if the protection of the emotions is gone

62
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:57,341
 and they cannot bear the touch of another person. That's why we have aversion to be touched, aversion to be looked.

63
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:13,941
And when the child is in an Ant-c. state, that is why it becomes very irritable. And you will see the child behaving exactly like Cham., wanting the mother all the time to hold him.

64
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:35,311
The child will not play naturally with the other children, will go to the mother. At the time it comes to the Ant-c. state looks very much to the protection of the mother. And it will stay there.

65
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:05,101
I try to show you the vulnerability and the sensitivity of the remedy.

66
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:26,131
In that respect it is that Ant-c. does not like socializing very much.

67
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:35,021
The socialization with Ant-c. is something that sometimes they can take it but they don't like it.

68
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:56,100
That's why in the books you will see 'misanthropy'. Do you know misanthropy? It means that they dislike other people. It's not that they dislike, it is that state of vulnerability.

69
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:07,451
And when they are in that state, they become very sulky, very withdrawn.

70
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:18,671
Can you imagine a very sentimental person, very withdrawn? Why? Because he is vulnerable and he does not want to be hurt again.

71
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:30,421
How he can be hurt? By coming into contact. He does not want any contact and he becomes withdrawn.

72
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:52,401
And that person he goes out in the night, walks along the side of the beach, looks at the moon and the emotions are freed, he is alone, he is there with the moon.

73
00:22:52,460 --> 00:23:03,729
The light produces a kind of stimulation in the emotions. We don't know how? We don't know what happens actually, how can you find the pathology but that is really happening.

74
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:13,940
The moon is there and the emotions are over flowing and they can be writing poems and they can be very sentimental. And they can be crying.

75
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:58,541
When they are just broken in a love affair, the worse time is when they go to bed and they start thinking and the emotions are coming, they are alone there.

76
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:21,081
Then they see no outlet. The impulse to kill themselves is so strong that they have to get up and walk up and down before they take these thoughts out and then they can go back and sleep.

77
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:47,241
In the text it says, 'makes verses'. But you understand the context under which this may happen. It doesn't mean that every Ant-c. is a poet.

78
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:55,360
It is the inclination there, it is the sentimentality, the state that you're looking for.
