1
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:56,211
I will try to give you information about different remedies and I will try to give an information which is 3-dimensional, an much as possible.

2
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:22,250
You may remember the remedies as personalities, as live entities. So therefore you will have to excuse a little bit my metaphors and vivacity and acting.

3
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,160
I don't want to give a stiff seminar.

4
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:46,001
I will give you the final information, final for the time being. The way I speak sometimes creates a lot of misunderstanding.

5
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:56,700
He says, George is an egoist. Final Materia Medica. It's not final, it's final what I finalized writing.

6
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:08,901
You are going to take this information and add it to your knowledge and you present eventually a much better information.

7
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:16,110
So this is the final information as I wrote it down on Aurum Metallicum.

8
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:44,000
And as we all know, Aurum-Gold imprints upon the human organism the idea of self destruction, of annihilation, of death.

9
00:02:48,390 --> 00:03:00,000
When injected into the living human organism tends to deprive the person of the will to live. The person does not want to live.

10
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:13,371
 It is the principal remedy, which develops a state of loathing for life, a desire to die.

11
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,940
And a strong tendency to commit suicide.

12
00:03:23,184 --> 00:03:37,680
As several other remedies correspond to this suicidal depression, we'll concentrate now on the peculiar characteristics of Aurum. And we'll start with the personality of Aurum.

13
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:55,371
As we said, the central theme of Aurum is extreme depression and loathing of life which progresses to suicidal thoughts and finally self-destruction.

14
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:08,430
What I have said so far has been clearly described in our books so far. Everybody is supposed to know this.

15
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:25,171
But an extreme depression does not usually develop over night.

16
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:37,461
And for homeopaths, for us it's very important to prevent a state than treat a state.

17
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:52,221
So what I'm going to give you as information is how a person, what is the make up of a person who is going to develop such state as suicidal depression.

18
00:04:52,290 --> 00:05:03,680
Which is the particular personality that is going to develop this desires to die.

19
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:29,021
So the pathological Aurum condition usually arises in people who possess a serious and introvert character.

20
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:45,291
They are generally closed people, responsible and quite refined.

21
00:05:48,460 --> 00:06:05,211
Serious, responsible, refined. At the early stages of pathology, one can sense that they avoid superficial contacts.

22
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:14,251
They tend to remain rather aloof or self contained.

23
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,751
Generally they are very disciplined and highly ambitious people.

24
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:40,171
They seem to have, the fundamental conviction that they are destined for a superior and esteemed position in life.

25
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:50,913
Slowly they build the character, the personality of the person who is going to develop Aurum symptomatology, just remember that.

26
00:06:50,960 --> 00:07:03,231
We have to recognize this character beforehand to prescribe Aurum and not allow him to go to deep depression where may most probably commit suicide.

27
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,771
Aurum, we must not forget is the metal gold, it's gold.

28
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:46,251
So if we personify gold, how gold would feel, superior from the other metals, having the highest position possible, it's the analogous of the person who has that inside him.

29
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:56,861
It is as if they feel that a high position in life is their birthright.

30
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:13,741
It's very interesting in Aurum how much you will see, how much of the personality of the gold, if we can say it this way.

31
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:29,181
This characteristic that I'm the highest, I'm the superior characterizes immediately what?

32
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:40,921
The egotistical quality of Aurum people. There is an egotistical element in them.

33
00:08:40,990 --> 00:09:05,091
Though they may not spoken out, they may not say I'm superior because they are serious, they are refined, they are responsible but what they feel is important because that element is going to be affected eventually.

34
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:21,491
When they are under stress, it is that element which is going to shake them inside, that egotistical element which will bring eventually the downfall of the person, of the inside.

35
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:41,811
They want to be and feel they are more capable than others. They have that conviction because they feel that they have a high intrinsic value like gold.

36
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:51,301
They set very high standards for themselves and work hard to achieve those standards.

37
00:09:52,620 --> 00:10:07,981
You see the serious element is not a person who is a superficial egoist, it's a person who works hard, is ambitious, I'm destined for high position, responsible, they work, they attain

38
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:19,811
and during that time where they have attained whatever it is, the stress comes, the grief comes, the upset comes and what happens?

39
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:28,051
We have to understand the inside psychology of the person to be able to prescribe correctly.

40
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:42,891
And if you are careful and you perceive these elements, then I'm sure you will be able to recognize Aurum, never mind what is saying on verbal level.

41
00:10:50,400 --> 00:11:10,331
But through this seriousness and ambition and diligent self application and industriousness, they seem to lose the sense of lightness and cheerfulness in life.

42
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:22,500
It goes away from their life. They become serious and heavy.

43
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:31,691
What you perceive is that seriousness, that application, that heaviness, no joy.

44
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:48,691
They will often say or convey the impression that throughout their life has been a pervading sense of seriousness with a touch of sadness.

45
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:55,821
There is a touch of sadness, even in the very first stages of Aurum.

46
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:13,611
It is as if a constant background of sad music is played and is accompanying the events of their lives.

47
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:23,321
As the pathology develops they will eventually go into a state of self reproach.

48
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:38,931
Self criticism and finally a feeling that they are worthless, incapable of accomplishing anything.

49
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:55,701
And the life process of an Aurum individual will actually observe the turmoils and reactions of the rising and fall of gold.

50
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:07,431
You will see gold people will believe, shooting up, it becomes the god of everybody, my gold, my gold.

51
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:33,441
Suddenly there is going down, suddenly. To see that in the personality of the person, how he rises, believing in himself and events around him and beyond his capacity to control bring the downfall suddenly.

52
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,681
I would like to go now into speaking about the Aurum children.

53
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:14,171
How we will recognize these children. They are children who are serious and aloof. They stay by themselves, not communicative.

54
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:22,531
Even at an early age it is difficult for them to establish close friendships.

55
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,771
These children are usually ambitious and attain prominence in their class at school.

56
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:43,611
Their parents will describe them as serious. At the same time one can see a sensitivity and a refinement in these children.

57
00:14:50,180 --> 00:15:06,630
And we can say that the weak point of Aurum children or even Aurum grown ups is what? It's the mental level, the emotional level or the physical level?

58
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:15,801
It's the emotional level. Their weak point is their emotional level. That is the level which is going to be affected.

59
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:27,401
Their mind will remain almost intact, even under a lot of stresses. The emotional is the one that is going to suffer primarily.

60
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:42,451
Not that the mind will not suffer eventually. If you drug somebody with gold, you know the gold injections that they give for rheumatoid arthritis

61
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:52,411
if you have an Aurum case where you give Aurum, gold injections, you will have a tremendous proving.

62
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:13,570
And in this proving you will see the destruction of the whole human being, mentally, emotionally etc. but what is prominent in Aurum is the fact that their emotional level is very weak.

63
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:35,320
They are vulnerable emotionally but at the same time they are very strong intellectually. Intellectually strong, emotionally vulnerable.

64
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:51,261
Externally one sees a person who appears quite normal. The vulnerability and extreme sensitivity is inside and not readily apparent on the surface.

65
00:16:51,330 --> 00:17:08,461
You will not see a child who will be frightened, fragile, no. You will see a serious child, intellectually very strong, he will ask you questions and he will give you answers.

66
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:17,251
But when you touch the emotional level, you see the weakness.

67
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:37,371
Once they leave the shelter of the home and enter school, they inevitably encounter some difficulty, being a critical remark by a teacher or fellow students

68
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:46,411
some problem with school work etc. Critical remarks will have a tremendous and immediate effect upon these children.

69
00:17:46,480 --> 00:18:02,910
You see the Aurum child has an idea about himself, is serious and everybody says he is so clever, he is so intelligent. But nobody has understood the weakness in his emotional level and then he goes to school.

70
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:15,621
And the teacher does not know about the child. He passes a remark like that. Little remark and the child is destroyed.

71
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:31,471
The weakness is that the analogue of the stress and the effect is not normal, is abnormal. The stress is  very little.

72
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:44,891
The remark is not so big. He says, why don't you write today clearly? You didn't write clearly your lessons. A remark like that, ahhh I did not write clearly.

73
00:18:44,960 --> 00:19:04,350
Everything is lost, the child can fall into a depression, why? Because there is a predisposition in that child. We're talking about Aurum children. So you see the stress very little, the effect too great.

74
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:20,430
Their emotional body cannot tolerate such remarks and they seem to break down very easily. A normal child will not be so significantly affected by so slight remark as the Aurum child.

75
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:36,171
The child will not show to anybody this reaction. This reaction, what he felt it will remain by himself.

76
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:51,531
He will not go to his mother and say, my teacher said I didn't write clearly. That's Pulsatilla. Pulsatilla also can go and I'm destroyed, I didn't write clearly. That's Pulsatilla.

77
00:19:51,600 --> 00:20:08,730
The Aurum child keeps this shock inside, I did not write clearly, I did not write clearly. You see, it's different all together. You see the seriousness, the internalization of things.

78
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:19,901
Phosphorus? You didn't write clearly. Ah my god I didn't write clearly. Next time I'll write clearly.

79
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:39,600
Nux Vomica will say, I didn't write clearly? I'll put fire to the teacher. It's a different reaction from inside.

80
00:20:42,030 --> 00:21:04,200
The Natrum muriaticum will take it inside also like Aurum but one day, two days the effect will be off. The effect of the grief is not as great as the effect on the Aurum child.

81
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:21,480
That is how a man goes back in his life when you examine him. And he says, 'God I don't remember when I have been joyful. I really never had joy in my life, since childhood'.

82
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:31,691
 This is how they will discuss, how they will give you their cases, since childhood. There was always a sad element in them.

83
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:51,560
You see they remember because the remarks stayed inside and created that thing that we'll call later on, steelness. A kind of metallic, we'll discuss about it.

84
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:14,131
Instead of showing the reaction, an internal doubt about his own abilities begins to grow.

85
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:23,531
And he begins to feel that the world is not a fit place in which to live.

86
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:42,221
You see the child does not discuss the matter. It discusses it only with himself and he says, if that can create so much suffering in me, I don't know if I will be able to live in this world.

87
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:52,971
It's not clearly as I say it. It's a sense, it's a feeling which the grown up will realize and will say, yes I have been thinking all the time.

88
00:22:53,040 --> 00:23:00,591
Is this a fit place for me to live? It's not that the child will say, well I don't know if this is a fit place for me to live, no.

89
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:15,920
You will not get that response. What you get is the seriousness, the ambition, the feeling, they try, they want to be first, they must be first; otherwise they are destroyed, they must either be first or die.

90
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:35,580
You understand how we're building the personality. I want you to go inside that person and understand the personality and feel the personality. I try to describe it with words of course; there is no other way of communication.

91
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:46,690
And if we had time I would show you 10 cases of video and you would see different aspects.

92
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:59,721
He will not express his doubts and concerns but will continue trying to attain the goals of his ambition.

93
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:17,811
Further education etc. Yet throughout his entire life a sense of bitterness remains and he continues to feel that the world is a cruel, uninviting place.

94
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:28,771
Eventually this attitude leads to deep depression and suicidal disposition.

95
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:40,431
These children are not emotionally expressive. They are not affectionate, they are not warm children.

96
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:58,221
It's not the child that says, 'ah papa I love you!', they embrace, no. Inside, hard and become more and more.

97
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:25,481
As we mention, they are introvert and serious; however they do need and demand affection. Aurum does not give affection but demands adoration, affection.

98
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:44,641
They demand in different way, subtle ways but it's like the gold staying there, golden stature, everybody looking and then stays cool, giving out nothing.

99
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:56,272
No warmth, no affection but expects that everybody will enter and say, oh you are great.

100
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:16,261
Later in life, when they have established for themselves a prominent position in their career or in society, they seem to receive affection because they are esteemed by others.

101
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:48,690
They will receive praise and commendations from parents, teachers and later society. They will create that situation where they will have this. They need this affection and approval in order to survive.

102
00:26:52,460 --> 00:27:03,841
It represents a kind of food for their weak, emotional nature, enabling them to maintain balance. An Aurum who does not receive attention, affection, admiration loses his balance.

103
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:17,971
We'll see how he loses his balance eventually; he goes more into depression and eventually shoots himself.

104
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:36,231
And we'll see how he will develop eventually, how the businessmen when they have big financial problem they will jump from the balcony.

105
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:47,951
Their exaggerated self confidence causes them to believe that they deserve the adulation they receive.

106
00:27:53,240 --> 00:28:05,441
But with the first grief they experience, they become very hurt inside and disappointed.

107
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:17,771
They will react angrily to the situation. But the anger remains inside, unexpressed. And eventually they develop resentment.

108
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:32,091
 You will see different phases. Of course there are certain stages we see that they become violent. The anger comes out. Just remember what we said, the anger remains inside.

109
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:59,800
They don't get admiration, they become angry, resentment stays inside. They don't talk. Eventually the anger and the resentment will come out in fits. And then we'll see how much violent they can become.

110
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:24,691
The Aurum child seeks the company of older persons. He exudes seriousness and most probably wants to understand intellectually what is this that is causing so much pain in the world.

111
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:41,101
It's a serious child that has felt very deep pain, has felt emotional pain. Aurum are capable of feeling tremendous emotional pain.

112
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:56,781
The pain they can feel is unbelievable. Immediately the child will say what is this I'm feeling? They don't want to discuss it verbally.

113
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:05,011
So they go and seek the company of older person, I want to know, they ask questions but the questions are not direct.

114
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:15,691
They will try to understand the world, they put serious questions. What is this, what is that? What is happening? Why my mother separated with my father?

115
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:35,291
I want to know why my uncle lost his money, what happened to him? They want to know why the teachers in the class were very angry and irritable.

116
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:50,611
It's amazing how many questions an Aurum child has and how much he understands. So much that the parents are not even aware of this fact.

117
00:30:52,240 --> 00:31:01,291
Usually the parents of an Aurum child are not aware that the child understands so much and thinks about these matters.

118
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:11,891
It is because of their sensitive natures that they suffer silently with even the slightest reprimands.

119
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:26,211
The Aurum child is sure to have been hurt from the very early years because of the contrast between the importance to which he attaches himself and what others see in him.

120
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:40,911
Do you see the contrast? The child is growing with the idea 'I can, I'm superior, I can attain, I'm higher, I'm more clever, I'm this and that'.

121
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:55,481
As he goes with these ideas then comes the reprimand from the teacher, the teacher or the parent says and that causes the problem.

122
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:12,991
He believes in himself and if others do not, this destroys him. That's how the conflict starts from the very beginning.

123
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:32,061
It's interesting to observe here that an enormous amount of tragedies have unfolded in the history of mankind because of this vain belief in gold and the consequent loss of it.

124
00:32:36,660 --> 00:33:01,141
A lot of tragedies in the world have taken place because collectively we believed in gold and the ups and downs of it brought about tremendous tragedies in the world.

125
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:15,731
Human beings have attached tremendous importance to gold and when they lose it, they feel that life is not worth living anymore.

126
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:28,131
You see in Aurum you will see that element that financial loss is of tremendous importance.

127
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,831
We don't see this with other remedies.

128
00:33:54,990 --> 00:34:07,880
She is cold. If she is affected by the ventilation what are the remedies? You are very sensitive to drafts.

129
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:28,011
Kali carbonicum, Rhus-tox, Silica, Dulcamara, Calcarea, Psorinum etc.

130
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:58,990
But the slightest draft? Kali carbonicum, it will feel the slightest draft. Hepar sulphur will have a repercussion if uncovers one leg, one arm, coughing.

131
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:24,121
We're going back on the adult and we'll say that these persons are possessed of high ideals.

132
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:43,211
Great self confidence, self discipline, serious mind and who seek both to dispense and receive justice in life.

133
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:59,741
Just imagine now this person. This person encounters the first romantic affair in his life.

134
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:22,531
The dynamics in such relationship are the following: the idealistic Aurum enters the relationship with his whole energy.

135
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:36,983
He gives himself to the relationship entirely. I'm talking about the first romantic relationship that the Aurum will come to. The first love affair.

136
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:55,641
You imagine the high ideals, the justice, the things in the person. He has not understood the world.

137
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:18,410
And he goes to the relationship, he believes in that relationship. He gives himself up totally to such relationship. He immerses himself totally
 in the idealism of the romance.

138
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:28,321
The relationship provides him with the warmth or the affection that his nature needs.

139
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:53,280
After some time in this relationship, he will start to observe various details which he does not like in the partner.

140
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:04,711
And he will eventually become more and more critical. He begins to withhold his affection for the least thing.

141
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:15,961
He begins to withhold his affection with little things such as is his partner should look another man.

142
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:40,411
They are sitting on a cafeteria, romantic affair and the woman sits casually and looks at another man. The Aurum, it becomes big thing for Aurum.

143
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:57,171
But he will not discuss it. He will not say anything. He will take it inside. I have to be careful.

144
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,421
And then he starts being critical.

145
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:23,971
Such events will take place more and more. Such things will happen every day more and more. And more and more he will withdraw his affection.

146
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:44,811
He will hold back his feelings, why? Because his feelings are not strong. The affection is not a strong feeling, uncontrollable, so he can reserve it, he can hold it back.

147
00:39:48,080 --> 00:40:03,161
Because he feels more and more that this relationship - what he tought is wrong - is not perfect, it's not ideal. Now he sees some faults in the relationship.

148
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:13,331
He becomes very critical about the other person, critical about the relationship and he doesn't want to give anymore himself. He tries to withhold.

149
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:31,681
But in this effort to withhold his affection, destroys the relationship and what is usual in these stories to hear is that this man ended the relationship.

150
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:51,261
And he will end the relationship without any previous hint. The woman will fall out of the sky. She says, why?

151
00:40:51,330 --> 00:41:09,611
It is because of these critical remarks every day that brought him to the realization, this is not ideal, this is not what it should be and therefore I have to stop it in order to prevent myself from going into pieces.

152
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:20,701
They feel behind it is always the emotional weakness. The emotions are not strong.

153
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:33,741
You see to what part in your life you defend yourself very much. To the part where you are most weak.

154
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:53,000
And Aurum is very weak in emotional. He is going to defend that emotional part in him because he knows if he let it loose, it may destroy him. And we really see certain Aurums cannot follow that course that I have described.

155
00:41:53,240 --> 00:42:04,931
You see we learn this course from people who stayed alive but there are Aurums who jumped and we never learned exactly what happened to them inside.

156
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:24,091
When the relationship was broken by the woman, the man jumped. Therefore we conjecture in those cases, because we have approached the problem very closely.

157
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:33,771
We heard stories where people are ready to jump. And they told us, eventually they confessed, if you make them speak they tell the whole story.

158
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:46,371
And you see how they feel and how they think until the moment they jump. We do not know how they will think by the moment they really take the decision.

159
00:42:46,440 --> 00:43:04,051
But I've heard descriptions of people who were very close and they have described to me exactly the situation and that is how we know, how we understand the process.

160
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:39,480
A person is loathing to face an impending future failure in the relationship. They cannot face it. Consequently he tries to avoid such a failure by being the one to end it first. But he does so at a tremendous emotional cost.

161
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:47,051
Subsequently the rupture of the relationship,
he will feel torn to pieces with grief.

162
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:57,740
He will suffer insomnia, often talking to himself when trying to fall asleep. This talking will occur in fits and jerks.

163
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:25,941
This is the night where he told his girlfriend 'that's it, it's finished' and he is hard because don't forget it's the woman that he loved before.

164
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:39,131
He cannot just say, 'leave me alone' no, he suffers. He has not discussed what he has observed all these months or years with the relationship.

165
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:51,291
He didn't say, 'oh yes you say you love me but you looked another man as well'. He is too proud to say that.

166
00:44:51,360 --> 00:45:01,601
So in his mind this is certain; she looked again and again at another man. She has done this or that which is not all right.

167
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:11,361
And eventually he comes, takes the decision himself because he is responsible, he is not discussing things, he is not telling things and then getting answers.

168
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:26,571
He says that's it, finished. The woman says, 'why, why?', she cries, she makes a whole of a noise. No, he has taken his decision and he is very hard.

169
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:46,451
You see the reduction of the emotional, how the emotional becomes reduced more and more and more until it will become a steeliness inside, a silence which is like steel.

170
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:58,291
And he makes himself so hard. Forget it. We are not for each other. We are not made for each other. He will say all these things and he will go to sleep.

171
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:11,161
The woman says, this man is crazy. He never had an objection while suddenly he gave this solution. She goes to sleep and it is impossible to sleep.

172
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:37,671
 He goes to sleep and then they talk but not blah, blah, blah. In fits. They think inside, 'she is going away, she didn't react properly, she really did not love me and yes I was right'

173
00:46:37,740 --> 00:47:03,171
 this is going in thought and then outside the other person will hear, 'no, no, go away, go!'.
 You see a jerking talking with little words. It's
like a heater that you press, press and
suddenly it has to get out some steam.

174
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:10,611
That idea you will see it again and again in Aurum and we'll describe another situation.

175
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:29,410
So this man will go night after night in that state. He will wake up with anxiety a few hours after sleep, 3 hours of sleep and then wake up with tremendous anxiety, then the talking will come, this jerky talking.

176
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:47,371
And the turmoil starts and the fight of the person to be able to survive because self destruction is going to be the main theme for adult Aurum.

177
00:47:48,440 --> 00:48:09,221
Self destruction is like lead towards self. Destruct, destruct, destruct and it goes like that in a crescendo and then they commit suicide.

178
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:19,521
But everything will happen inside without anybody understanding anything outside. Outside everything will be perfect.

179
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:30,384
Nobody will understand or feel anything. You have to realize that a man who makes a lot of noise:

180
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:50,471
'Don't tell me that because I will kill myself!'. This is not Aurum. Aurum will not come and tell the physician, 'you know something I want to commit suicide'.

181
00:48:51,800 --> 00:49:02,721
He will say it at a certain point but he has to understand to whom he is talking, whether the doctor is serious, whether he understands him.

182
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:15,951
All these conditions before and if the doctor says, 'what I feel is, there is this kind in you, what do you think, how do you feel?'

183
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:39,991
He says, 'well I think you are right. I never enjoy. I always thought about death, even as a child I always wanted to die, I didn't want to live. I don't remember any time that I wanted to live, I just wanted to commit suicide. I thought many times'.

184
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:55,040
This is the kind of answer that you will get but not immediately. He is serious, he is introvert, he is not communicative, he has not a strong emotional side.

185
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,304
You have to take all these things into consideration and make the picture.

186
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:22,020
He is going through all this turmoil inside him. He will remain closed, silent, not communicative and brooding.

187
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:37,091
Aurum will soon lose all its ambition and reach a state of complete loss of hope.

188
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:51,521
Making it easier for him to exit to leave this disappointing world.

189
00:50:53,770 --> 00:51:04,851
There is another aspect of Aurum that may develop in some of the Aurum cases and this is the resentment and the vengefulness.

190
00:51:44,720 --> 00:52:19,360
The idea is that you go into that state and you feel the state. After such a grief, resentment and vengefulness lay to his character. He wants to take revenge in his next lover.

191
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:36,221
What happened, it was a very disappointing thing for him. He did not actually realize how all this took place because it was so intense inside.

192
00:52:36,290 --> 00:53:03,361
And after this suffering that he went through, what is left is not a feeling of love or affection or disappointment.

193
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:14,541
What is left is a feeling that next time I'm not going to be in the same state. I'm going to show you.

194
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:20,941
This tendency or revenge comes inside.

195
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:32,141
And then an Aurum will act very coldly towards the next relationship.

196
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:43,591
He practically gives nothing from himself apart from an intellectual communication. He gives nothing from the emotions.

197
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:48,461
The emotions have been kept closed.

198
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:59,920
The new relationship is established primarily on an intellectual level.

199
00:54:03,248 --> 00:54:11,390
The Aurum individual being considered attractive, especially because of his mental capability.

200
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:27,171
However Aurum can display a lot of sexual excitement in the relationship.

201
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:55,011
Aurum are quite sexually excited without involvement of the emotional side. It is an intellectual relationship which has another aspect which is the sexual aspect.

202
00:54:55,080 --> 00:55:16,251
The emotional is missing almost completely. And unless a relationship has communication on those 3 levels, it is an unbalanced kind of relationship which is not going to end happily.

203
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,520
Problems are going to develop.

204
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:57,171
Eventually in such a relationship what is going to happen is - usually - the other person gets attached to such a person who is cool and always remote and a feeling that you will never be able to communicate or to conquer her or him.

205
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:07,591
Because of that feeling or remoteness, there is a cold remoteness that is very strong, it is there, he is not giving himself.

206
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:16,731
Because of that there is always, always an attachment of the other person to that person. He gets more attached and more attached.

207
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:28,110
Once this is felt by the Aurum, then he treats the other person coldly and almost cruel.

208
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:48,961
And then it starts a kind of game where he will be very critical, he will inflict suffering to the other person and at the same time silently he will suffer himself.

209
00:56:50,270 --> 00:57:03,571
Because it's not a crude person, he is a refined person who understands, who has perception, who is very intellectually grounded, who understands what he is doing.

210
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:13,971
When I say that, this is going to cause suffering and the other woman or man is suffering and then they suffer themselves.

211
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:27,971
And there is a kind of vicious circle because the more they suffer, the more they will go into depression, the more they go into depression, the more remote will be and the more of this situation will arise.

212
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:50,781
Eventually an Aurum person will feel that there is no way, that he may have a successful love affair in this world.

213
00:57:53,860 --> 00:58:09,881
What makes him come to this conclusion is his realization that he is completely incapable of dealing with rejection.

214
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:28,131
A rejection which has the motive that somebody is admiring him and at a certain point stops admiring him.

215
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:43,331
This is a fear of a downfall that I am financially very strong and if I lose this position, then everything is lost.

216
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:50,821
This person admires me very much and if I lose this admiration I'm done.

217
00:58:50,890 --> 00:59:06,011
You see how much they depend upon others, upon the admiration and that is why in the beginning we said, they need the admiration and the love and the affection of others.

218
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:14,371
This makes them live. They are not people who can live. They are people born to destroy, to die.

219
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:34,830
The idea of death and especially death through self destruction is intimately inborn with the Aurum individual. It's very strange situation.

220
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:53,771
He feels that he will not survive if he is rejected by his lover and immediately considers the ultimate destruction for himself, which is suicide.

221
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:11,320
They say, now it's finished if the lover say to the Aurum 'it's finished, we can't go anymore', then the first thing that the Aurum person will think is suicide. 'I don't want to live'.

222
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:27,360
But at the same time he refuses to accept any kind of fault in the relationship. He wants the relationship perfect.

223
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:40,901
This of course happens not because Aurum is always pure, you see he goes for perfection, he wants perfection.

224
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:51,521
Are you perfect? How do you demand perfection from others? In a relationship you demand perfection? Are you perfect? He is not.

225
01:00:51,590 --> 01:01:05,541
He is not perfect himself but he cannot do otherwise. He sees things in an idealistic manner, in an idealistic way.

226
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:11,491
He is like gold that does not accept impurities. If you put impurities you will see it immediately.

227
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:27,971
For gold person, impurities are seen too much. You put an impurity inside, it doesn't match with the gold and all together. You will see piece of black lead there. He will say, what it is?

228
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:39,120
 It spoils the gold, it spoils the perfection. It's the same idea with gold. He does not want to see the impurity. He sees the impurity very much on the others.

229
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:58,291
That's why he's always very critical. You see in the papers and the book says, brooding, critical and statements like that. You don't understand the statement unless you understand the personality.

230
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:08,171
Everybody can brood but why, for what reasons? Under what circumstances? This is very important.

231
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:40,283
Let us talk about the reasons and the ways that Aurum will commit suicide, why?

232
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:53,961
We said that business and finance success is very important to Aurum. They are going to business because of financial dream.

233
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:09,315
Despite of being competitive, they are very competitive, hard working businessmen, they retain a high degree of sensitivity.

234
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:38,320
They are very sensitive about their obligations. So much so that when they are faced with a serious financial failure, without a way to meet their obligations Aurum people will be unable to see a way out.

235
01:03:39,970 --> 01:03:49,101
They cannot tolerate the possibility of financial bankruptcy. They cannot tolerate the financial downfall.

236
01:03:49,170 --> 01:04:02,601
Because of the implications of personal and professional situations that will be raised.

237
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:14,831
Can you imagine, I'm a successful businessman, I pay all my duties, I'm just, I'm doing this, I'm doing that. All this is going on in his mind all the time.

238
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:24,751
The moment that there is a financial downfall, then he says, now I owe him these money and I cannot pay him. He cannot face that situation.

239
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:41,621
It is impossible I owe him and I cannot pay him back. There is no way out. So their mind is fixed on that idea. They cannot find another way.

240
01:04:42,930 --> 01:05:15,820
And that is the time that without giving any hint or anything beforehand that somebody would understand what they are thinking, without any hint of what they are going to do they find themselves in a balcony and they just fall and
 kill themselves.

241
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:35,211
It is the situation where we had in the financial crisis of 1929, people jumping from high places, financial suicide, these are the type of people.

242
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:46,180
I mean you know the stories, you know how many people jumped from the balconies because they could not face.

243
01:05:50,190 --> 01:06:05,211
The depression goes on, I mean it will not go from one day to the other. It will go from a depression, bigger depression, I cannot face, I have this obligation, I have that obligation.

244
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:20,320
Then they paralyze inside, they lose the capacity to work, to think out solutions. They seem as if they have no capacities at all. At this moment they feel that they are not capable at all.

245
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:31,401
And that they cannot face the fact that the other people will not anymore adore them, they will not anymore admire them.

246
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:38,291
But on the contrary they will say, you owe me so much money, what happened. That they cannot face.

247
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:54,401
And they commit suicide. But what is interesting in this act is that Aurum people chose a high place from which they jump down.

248
01:06:55,470 --> 01:07:06,691
A sudden fall. A complete downfall. Crash. The market's crash.

249
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:25,611
Diseases are not apart from our society, in which we live and what we do with our lives.

250
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:33,351
And how an Aurum is developed, why he committed suicide, he never said anything to anybody. That is the usual story.

251
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:45,811
He never said. He looked quite all right. He had no problem. I mean yes he may have some financial problems but I'm sure he would get out of it.

252
01:07:45,880 --> 01:08:01,021
Everybody else thinks he would get out very easily, he cannot face it unless you give him a high potency of Aurum.

253
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:15,911
Then suddenly we have seen it from one day to the other, the person will come back to his mind and will see the problem as it really is.

254
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:30,731
He says, oh I will work, I will do something. I will find a way. Where before taking the Aurum, he was ready to commit suicide.

255
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:47,251
In Aurum cases, in these cases you will see especially with people who have become Aurum without being constitutional Aurum.

256
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:58,241
They have become Aurum because of their grief, of their stress at this moment. Like you become Ignatia, most of you, especially the women when you lose your lover.

257
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:16,391
You are not constitutional Ignatias, you may lose your lover, 'ah!'. When you see 'ah!' and similar, take Ignatia.

258
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:32,400
And then 'he is fool, I don't care about him'. It's finished the problem, that means you are not constitutional Ignatias. Ignatia is imprinted upon the organism under stress.

259
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:48,991
Like if you get a cold, Bryonia picture is imprinted upon you. You are not constitutional Bryonia but you have an acute situation where you become Bryonia at this moment.

260
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:58,811
Where you become Dulcamara or Rhus tox, where you become an acute situation, Ignatia, you become Natrum muriaticum or Aurum.

261
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:14,291
This Aurum which has been imprinted because of financial problems can be lifted from one day to the other. And you can see miracle.

262
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:27,531
It's another person next day, beautiful. And a person who is also an Aurum person as we described it from young age, he is not going to be recovered so easily.

263
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:48,940
The Aurum will help him but still the seriousness, the conditions underlying will continue. The person who is not Aurum constitutionally but who needs Aurum at the moment of stress, will be another person all together.

264
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:21,091
Aurum invests his belief in high ideals.
Wealth, justice, prominence.

265
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:38,941
These are ideas of Aurum. Should he be disappointed by any of these ideals such as been treated unjustly by someone in positional authority for instance, he can become quickly disappointed and depressed.

266
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:57,091
This painful experience can motivate him to try to reform society. To reestablish order and justice in the world according to his own understanding, ability and influence.

267
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:04,651
Consequently we have two types of people that they will develop.

268
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:23,651
Out of this disappointment that they go through because they need justice and they are treated unjustly, they will say I want to make the world just.

269
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:31,251
Now there are two types of people that can develop from such a stress. Constitutional Aurum.

270
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:39,430
The one is a successful businessman in the society and the other, you know what it is?

271
01:12:39,499 --> 01:12:44,360
An anarchist.
You know anarchist?

272
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:56,091
I'm going to reform society according to my understanding and standards. I'm going to show you justice.

273
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:17,671
The successful businessmen will work diligently towards prominence within the establishment.

274
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:27,251
He will attain considerable heights due to his capacity for constant work, as he is workaholic.

275
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:40,971
Aurum is a workaholic, he wants to work. It's a driving force to work. You see if you analyze all this, his balancing outlets

276
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:51,811
you see emotionally he is weak, he needs to be admired and therefore he puts all his energy into working, attain, prominent, more prominent.

277
01:13:51,880 --> 01:14:00,581
'I will become prominent, I cannot love. What he says inside is, I cannot love'.

278
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:13,771
And that's why Aurum is not loved in the way that an Argentum nitricum is loved or Phosphorus is loved or a Pulsatilla is loved. It's completely for different reasons.

279
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:24,480
 They love him because of his financial security they give, the responsibility, the sincerity, they are sincere, honest, responsible, they admire him.

280
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:52,541
The Phosphorus will be loved because of his emotions. He will always lend money 'can you give me some money, I don't have'. You don't get anything material from Phosphorus but you get a lot emotionally.

281
01:14:52,610 --> 01:15:06,800
I will provide you with lots of affection and lots of love and now you give me some money so I can exist also. You see the ideas? These are real things which are happening.

282
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:29,410
What I'm trying, I'm aiming at is to establish in your memory the type of person who will need Aurum and be able to recognize it in time, don't let it go through a long time. Because they will not talk.

283
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:43,251
You may have your child or your father, your mother, in the family. You may have cases of that type around you and you don't recognize them.

284
01:15:45,760 --> 01:16:01,091
Wait a moment, now this person is Aurum, he is so serious, so ambitious, so working. Maybe you inquire about the stresses he went through and you find out.

285
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:15,560
Yes I don't want to live. This world is no good for me. This world is no good, not for me. They believe that the world is bad and unjust.
