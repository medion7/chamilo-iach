1
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:35,933
In my writings I have repeatedly emphasized the hierarchical structure of the human being.

2
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:46,903
In the healthy individual the mental sphere being the most central to normal functioning, exerts its control over the physical and emotional spheres.

3
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:55,993
We know the control of the mind upon these spheres. On the other hand, in other types of patients there is a weakening of this central controlling influence.

4
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:14,349
To this group belongs the Argentum nitricum. In the neurological system this weakness leads to clumsiness, incoordination and finally ataxia and convulsions.

5
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:25,251
In the psychological state, it leads to impulses which the whole mark of Argentum nitricum.

6
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:56,180
If we wanted to describe an Argentum nitricum case with few words, we could say that it is
an over emotional, impulsive individual with weakening mental faculties, that allow for
a lot of impulses and the host of fears.

7
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:03,800
An individual whose power of coordination and balance has been upset on all levels.

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,547
In the early stages of Argentum Nitricum, let us again go to the personality and understand.

9
00:02:13,123 --> 00:02:24,903
We've been in the personality last time with Aurum and  I heard some comments, saying words, this is the fantasies of Vithoulkas.

10
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:34,220
When you go back to practice, you will find very soon it's not a fantasy, it's hard facts.

11
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:45,153
In the early stages of Argentum nitricum individuals are jolly, extrovert and optimistic.

12
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:57,183
Far from being egotistical, they are giving an attention in conversation.

13
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:08,483
They are people who enjoy the comforts of life. They have a strong sexual appetite, as well as appetite for tasty foods.

14
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:33,850
Salty and sweet foods and high living. And they will avoid ordeals at any cost. They don't like suffering. If they see suffering they go away. When you see suffering, there is no Argentum nitricum. In a situation with suffering, Argentum nitricum will say goodbye.

15
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:43,033
At the same time they possess a straight forwardness and simplicity.

16
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,470
These patients seem to be incapable of hiding their feelings for long.

17
00:03:52,520 --> 00:04:01,323
For example, a person may be unable to hide for long a romantic affair from his wife.

18
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:16,443
He confesses the transgression and feels great remorse. Arg-n individuals may feel completely be overtaken by a sense of guilt for their actions and will cry with remorse.

19
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:23,993
They become very emotional and weep as they tell their transgression. I'm just giving some example.

20
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:33,752
 I want to make it more vivid for you to understand the situation where you have a lot of energy.

21
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:44,440
And I tell you the secret: you have a lot of energy when an individual has no doubts. Doubt takes away a lot of energy, intellectual conflict inside it takes all the energy.

22
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:07,803
So they have a lot of energy, why? No doubts. The mind is not the controlling influence in them.

23
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,360
It's the heart, it's the feelings, the impulses. Impulsive, jolly individuals.

24
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:37,010
Let's have a good time, girlfriends, high living, intense living, no secrets inside, everything has to come out, it's plethoric. They're plethoric in their emotions like most of you.

25
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:17,043
 He will get up in the class and say, that is me, he is an extrovert. He's an extrovert, he's full of life, full of emotions. He doesn't care is someone criticizes. 'It's alright, let's love each other'

26
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:28,153
It's the feeling which comes out, the emotions which are strong, the energy which is strong and it is not harnessed by the mind.

27
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:44,813
And that's why eventually we will see the mind weakened and weakened and we'll see how the impulses develop and overtake eventually the individual and he will start suffering.

28
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:57,823
Before he starts suffering, Argentum nitricum individuals will suffer a lot eventually because of things that we are saying but they like good life.

29
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:12,960
And good heart and good conversation and conversation on what? On an emotional level mostly. You see the contrast between one individual and another individual?

30
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:24,110
They may want to commit suicide also, sometimes they say 'I'm afraid but I want to kill myself'. It's a different thing all together.

31
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:48,500
Such an extrovert character. They are extrovert. Pains at this early stage have an impulsive element. There is an impulsive element in Argentum nitricum.

32
00:07:50,320 --> 00:08:04,703
When he sees something, when he will be in a situation, he will be the first one to jump up and react to the situation.

33
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:11,603
You see the mind is not strong, it's not controlling, it's not the controlling influence.

34
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,264
Why the mind has become the controlling influence in the West?

35
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,680
North, West, why?

36
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:46,883
-A new organ? You claim nobody had any brain so far! Today we have brains!

37
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:53,843
We cultivated the mind in order to overcome pain.

38
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:10,543
In order to overcome pain and to have more pleasure. This is the idea and therefore the mind will try to avoid suffering at any cost.

39
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:36,093
By devising things, by finding out ways to get out of suffering. And because the mind is very limited and does not understand it's a stupid organ, the logical mind is a stupid organ, absolutely stupid and very limited in its logic.

40
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:43,263
It says well it's better if I sit like that because nobody will understand what I think.

41
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:49,243
There comes the homeopath and says, well I tell you how you feel now.

42
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:14,563
There are always playings that betray the mind. You cannot really hold everything. Somewhere you have to get loose and then you understand.

43
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:24,733
Now the Argentum nitricum don't need that. He says, what's the mind? The mind does not exist.

44
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:38,133
It's that type of person, I exaggerate a little bit but just to understand and to be able for you to construct the personality on which you're going to prescribe.

45
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:48,673
The characteristics are strong characteristics
for Argentum nitricum. Mostly, not always.

46
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:58,350
Red face, a lot of blood pumping. Thick lips.

47
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:32,963
We go to Natrums, these sensitive individuals with everything they see. 'Oh God, she looked at me! Maybe he is thinking about me!', Natrum muriaticum. An Argentum nitricum says, hello. You see the difference?

48
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,743
Now what kind of diseases are going to develop? One individual, the other individual?

49
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:50,393
And you see the logic behind the structures? We understand things more in depth by laughing and without losing our humor.

50
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:56,473
I hope you don't misunderstand me, I'm a very serious man.

51
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:22,920
I think I had given a little bit of Arg-n in Norway and everybody said, George he is Arg-n. The other day I was giving Aurum, ah he is Aurum!
 So I've been through all the remedies.

52
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:48,440
The patient may be explosively irritable.
If his wife drops something, the patient may impulsively shout 'God you did it again.
Why the hell can't you hold anything?'

53
00:12:52,420 --> 00:13:06,440
The temper is uncontrolled by normal mental restraints that we usually exercise. It flares and it goes away immediately.

54
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:29,664
Where Nux vomica goes like that. If it is to control Nux vomica, I was talking about Nux vomica yesterday, it starts burping.

55
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:58,283
You see the solar plexus, the stomach, the emotions are mostly placed in the stomach; that's why they will develop eventually duodenal ulcer, the Nux vomicas.

56
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:21,530
And they are so controlled. But some of them are very impulsive. Nux vomica are full of energy which is a little bit harsh energy. And that harsh energy burns them.

57
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:43,330
Argentum nitricum is another vibration. It's a jolly vibration; that's why the whole class eventually will laugh in the end. You see, feeling the character. Understanding the character.

58
00:14:46,960 --> 00:15:03,600
If you see somebody who is very serious, you
 will think twice. You have Argentum nitricum symptoms but this guy does not look like.

59
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:18,132
And eventually all the family knows that all these explosions are nothing. They mean nothing for the Argentum nitricum.

60
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:32,133
He may shout but he has forgotten. I shouted to you? What are you talking? I don't love you? I love you very much. They can cry.

61
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:54,643
It's all emotional excitement, it's not holding back. If you shout to Natrum muriaticum...  Argentum nitricum and Natrum muriaticum married together !

62
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:11,030
In the beginning the aggravation of both, terrific. It's very difficult to marry two medicines together.

63
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:26,050
But even two Natrum muriaticums, two Nux vomicas! Oh God, in the house there is constant battle, one throwing the other.

64
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:38,210
And if you get a Nux vomica with a woman Lilium tigrinum even worse. A woman Lilium tigrinum and man Nux Vomica, forget the marriage.

65
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,464
An Argentum nitricum can suppress tremendously a Staphysagria.

66
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:21,083
In some cases the patient may not show the irritability but only to his wife and to his family.

67
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:48,043
At work his uncertainty about his professional abilities and his inability to argue intellectually with his boss, makes him withhold his anger because he has a feeling of being inefficient.

68
00:17:49,320 --> 00:18:01,723
He understands that. He understands his mind is not strong, is not powerful, is not very clear and therefore he tries to withhold.

69
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:15,940
Therefore the answer that you will get may be 'no, I'm not showing anger'. But you ask his wife. He forgets that in the house he gets it all out to his wife.

70
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:29,443
The emotions are robust, as we said, and the person is not highly refined and certainly not over sensitive.

71
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:41,043
You may get some sensitivity of course but the sensitivity that we see with Ignatia, with Natrum carbonicum, with Natrum muriaticum.

72
00:18:41,120 --> 00:19:00,349
These kind of sensitivities which are, don't touch me. With the Nux vomica you feel that if you go against, you had it. You feel it at any moment.

73
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:09,523
With Ignatia you feel that if you say one more word, she may go into crying.

74
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:22,963
With Natrum muriaticum you feel a kind of distance between you and the person. It's very serious. Natrum muriaticum says, don't criticize me.

75
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:50,153
Aurum, as we said, cannot stand criticism at all. An Aurum with criticism will look absolutely the same as before and then this moment is destroyed inside. It's disappointed tremendously.

76
00:19:50,230 --> 00:20:05,403
He is suffering, his emotions are becoming with great sensitivity. It produces a sensitivity for the person, not for others.

77
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:23,153
He will not be attacking easily the other person, the Aurum, almost never. He will not ask for help. He will not discuss it at all. You see the depression how it comes, you feel it.

78
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:31,643
Now Argentum nitricum, you do something to him and he immediately goes to a friend and he says, what has happened to me.

79
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:49,223
What has happened? I had this girlfriend and I gave everything to her and now she has left me. He cries, he expresses his emotions. After that, he is all right.

80
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,523
His emotions are too vital to allow wounded feelings or deep emotional scars.

81
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:12,053
This type of individual can be extremely sympathetic. He may be easily move to tears when hearing of another person suffering.

82
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:26,829
Like Phosphorus. Phosphorus is close, not Causticum. For Causticum sympathetic has to
 be raised in the Repertory. It has 3 degrees.

83
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:49,853
It's in italics. You may still raise it but it is a different sympathetic. With intensity, seriousness. Here we have a serious situation.

84
00:21:49,930 --> 00:22:05,493
This man is worth very much and nobody pays attention to him. This man is suppressed and the government has to be overthrown.

85
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:12,683
It's an intensity and a seriousness but not this affection. This expression of affection.

86
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:46,113
Also he will be better with consolation. Argentum nitricum will like consolation, will like to discuss.

87
00:22:47,360 --> 00:23:01,003
At this early stage there is little mental pathology or at most only hints of the extreme anxiety or strong impulses which occur later.

88
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:10,053
The patient will seek attention mainly for physical complains such as an ulcer, colitis, vertigo, headaches etc.

89
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:22,120
It's at this point however that the patient may become vulnerable to mental over exertion. You see he cannot take up a lot of mental over exertion.

90
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:43,923
These Argentum nitricums being extroverts will take positions where they feel most happy, like myself. I'm so happy because I talk to you.

91
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:57,093
And they talk and they exchange energies and they do this, an evangelist, an entertainer, a priest, a homeopath.

92
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:19,120
But eventually after giving themselves to such tasks, they start feeling tired. Their mind becomes more and more weak. And then the problem starts.

93
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:35,893
One of the earliest symptoms of the mental-emotional pathology of Argentum nitricum is the weakness of memory. He starts first losing his memory.

94
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:44,133
The patient cannot longer perform as he did previously at his work, especially due to the failure of the memory.

95
00:24:49,050 --> 00:25:10,863
The next thing that develops is a feeling of hurry. As he notices his inefficiency with the mind, he feels time is not enough to perform whatever has to do.

96
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:30,720
He wants to accomplish things but there is not enough time. You see the slowness of the mind is a complex, memory drops, mind becomes slower; at the same time obligations.

97
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:43,810
And then starts the anxiety and I have to do and I don't have enough time and then the feeling of hurry start to develop inside.

98
00:25:46,560 --> 00:26:00,070
And he becomes very impatient and also he can hardly wait for an appointment, like Nux Vomica.

99
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:14,003
And there comes the great anxiety to arrive in time. He leaves home much earlier than what is needed for an appointment.

100
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:26,443
That is the time where the anticipation for an appointment, whatever it might be even a simple appointment, it may be an ordeal for him.

101
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:41,050
And he prepares much earlier. He will leave the house much earlier and of course we know that he will have complains from anticipating an appointment.

102
00:26:47,640 --> 00:27:04,033
The anticipation may bring perspiration, palpitation, frequent urination and up to diarrhea. You will not see in every case of Argentum nitricum diarrhea on anticipation.

103
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:15,273
Sometimes you will even see that. But you will see perspiration, palpitation, frequent urination.

104
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:29,880
At this point the patient becomes aware of the weakening of his mental faculties.

105
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:39,043
He feels incompetent and inefficient especially when confronting some short of intellectual challenge.

106
00:27:45,560 --> 00:28:01,203
It's the type of person that even if he knows the subject well he's going to talk about, he has great anxiety and anticipating to give the lecture.

107
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:13,883
You will see me every time I go to the bathroom before I come here. That is the Argentum Nitricum. I have to give the lecture.

108
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:27,283
And palpitation and it can reach up to diarrhea. Whatever the complain may be. You may have chronic colitis, then you see the pains.

109
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:42,503
There is a kind of, as if the whole organism lives on instinct. It cannot be controlled.

110
00:28:50,480 --> 00:29:03,680
Where a Natrum muriaticum may wait 48 hours before he goes to urinate. I say, how you did it? I say it was impossible, there is so many people in there.

111
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:25,980
Nobody would have seen you. Impossible. But Ambra grisea cannot go for stool for a month. Because there are people that they will hear.

112
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:39,573
Impossible, they just hold it, they've constipation for one month. In hospitals, in other people places.

113
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:54,523
You see how each one of the personalities is behaving and we have to perceive and understand and recognize because such symptoms are so valuable.

114
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:10,760
You battle with a case and then it comes and says, do you have a stool easily? What do you mean easily? If you are in a friend's house, will you go?

115
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:23,640
The bathroom has to be on the other floor for Ambra grisea to go and have a stool. If it is next door, no they will hear me. I exaggerate a bit but this is the idea behind.

116
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:41,523
A Natrum muriaticum even if he goes to the bathroom, may not be able, the retention of the urine is automatic, is not controlled. 48 hours no urine.

117
00:30:45,780 --> 00:31:09,173
With Argentum nitricum it doesn't matter who is in front. With the whole class, do it. That's the type of the person. M.Tyler describes a typical case:

118
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:24,203
A poor little school girl of 6 in such terror of anticipation that when the school bell rang, she put her head on her hands and vomited.

119
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:41,560
Argentum nitricum finished that trouble promptly. You see the girl, instead of having diarrhea, she had vomited. Don't' say, ah vomiting is not written in the book. It doesn't matter, it's the idea.

120
00:31:47,590 --> 00:32:09,503
How she did it also is important because you may get another case. With total anxiety and mental disturbance which you may get vomiting in the school, where they get up in the morning.

121
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:41,160
I'm sorry I'm talking about the subject. When these girls year after year, they cannot face the world, the school and you see every morning, vomiting in a rocket way is Veratrum album.

122
00:32:41,840 --> 00:33:03,430
But it's another child all together, the Veratrum album is a different child. It's the most I would say intelligent child of the Materia Medica. Very intelligent children, very serious.

123
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:18,163
 I told you Aurum is always serious, always attaining, I have to be the first. You don't see Aurum reading detective stories.

124
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:31,913
 Argentum Nitricum only detective stories, Aurum never, always a serious book, philosophy, science etc.

125
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:51,673
The children Veratrum album you will see a peculiar seriousness where they enquire about everything, about God. They look like Calcarea carbonica in this respect.

126
00:33:51,720 --> 00:34:06,713
Religion, philosophy, understanding basic questions of life, you will see Veratrum Album impressively asking serious questions.

127
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:25,973
You see that child is not normal. A normal thing for a child is to play, to be happy and then in the morning the vomiting. Before go to school, it's not that they do not know their lessons

128
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:42,560
 but the sensitivity in facing the world, they are
 so sensitive and perceptive and understand
 their parents. They are intuitive, they will
make remarks to the parents that the parents sometimes they will be ashamed.

129
00:34:43,440 --> 00:35:03,883
Why did you tell a lie? Of course it is a lie for this and this reason.That is a serious child. 'You said a lie. Why you said it? Why didn't you behave right in that situation?'

130
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:16,603
 They make remarks. They ask questions. God, angels, why people are suffering? Why people are poor? I want to know.

131
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:24,363
Somebody works more and somebody works less. Yes but this who works less, maybe he is not able to work more.

132
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:42,980
They are very high intelligent and then of course they go into teaching. I have noticed that if you treat Veratrum children, they become almost genius.

133
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:59,563
Eventually from mad, because the parents bring the Veratrum child as a crazy, and from crazy they become extremely intelligent.

134
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:09,783
They retain a kind of intelligence which is very very high. As if Veratrum speeds up the mind.

135
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:26,500
It speeds the body also, they can run, the autistic children. One autistic child in here and could run through and would never stop.

136
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:38,153
-Would you see the perceptive intelligence without the hyperactivity?

137
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:44,813
-Without the hyperactivity? Yes but they will have other things.

138
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:59,813
I can't remember now details but you may see a tick in their legs. They take the foot and push it up.

139
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:09,320
They do motions which are constant.

140
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:34,643
What I've tried in the Materia Medica I'm writing, is to give you the basic ideas. But it would be impossible if I was trying to give examples. It would be example after example after example and then you are lost.

141
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:48,610
If you understand the basic idea, it doesn't matter if it's vomiting now or have diarrhea, the basic idea is ailments from anticipation ...

142
00:37:53,370 --> 00:38:09,200
Where the vomiting of Veratrum is when he gets up in the morning. It's not the anticipation. Anticipates perhaps to face the world, perhaps it's too hard. And this symptom I've seen also in Calcarea carbonica.

143
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:27,273
Nausea and tendency to vomit and vomiting in the morning on waking for years, since childhood. I got a case of hiatus hernia.

144
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:45,683
He was advised to be operated and he came to me and had all the symptomatology, and nausea and vomiting in the morning since childhood.

145
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:57,483
With Calcarea Carbonica everything went away plus the hiatus hernia. It's a few years now, no problem, no pains, nothing, no operation.

146
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:23,070
As the pathology of Argentum Nitricum develops, the patient seems to lose more and more intellectual strength and control. Rather he seems to be controlled, almost overwhelmed
 by his emotional impulses.

147
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:36,443
Psychological pathology may begin in a different way as well. Often the patient may confront a type of shock which overwhelms his balance.

148
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:46,723
The beginning of pathology may be a shock that overtakes his balance.

149
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:56,813
Frequently these shocks come in the form of the death in the family. Or perhaps someone close to him develops a serious disease like cancer.

150
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:07,043
The patient then begins to develop great anxiety especially concerning his own health.

151
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:18,164
Also he may develop great concern or anxiety about others, his family or friends.

152
00:40:18,264 --> 00:40:32,400
Argentum nitricum is one of the main remedies for anxiety about his own health. A hypochondriacal kind of anxiety.

153
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:53,120
He becomes over anxious or even frightened when he is alone. You see how much he needs the support of others. That's why he comes into contact so easily.

154
00:40:54,890 --> 00:41:17,243
In the northern countries, from Sweden upwards, all right from Switzerland upwards, you will not get the type I'm describing exactly.

155
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:36,713
Because it's the culture, you are not allowed to express. So even Argentum nitricum will be much less expressive than the Mediterraneans.

156
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:51,880
Here we discover more easily the Arg-n. There it's not that you don't have Arg-n, it's that you don't discover them. Because they learn still to control themselves.

157
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:23,923
And not only he is afraid to be alone but he has great desire to have somebody near him, to have company.

158
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:38,643
When he is alone in the night, then that is the time when fear of death overcomes him.

159
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:53,663
As these tendencies towards anxiety and fear continue, he may reach a state of severe anxiety neurosis with irrational behavior.

160
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:10,003
In Argentum nitricum the fear of death and anxiety about health may reach unprecedented heights.

161
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:23,683
When alone, he can easily go into panic states, with trembling all over, mumbling, stuttering and even convulsions.

162
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:53,293
This kind of thing. 'I'm afraid'. He will express it. Especially in the night, when the night comes, they are alone and nobody in the room, the fear comes and gets bigger and bigger

163
00:43:53,370 --> 00:44:05,600
until they start trembling and then they go into convulsions. So panicked they can become.

164
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:32,803
The individual becomes so irrational during that fear that feels anything may happen to him.

165
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:48,933
That he may faint, that he may pass away, that he may die, that evil forces will take him over.  All kinds of irrational things.

166
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:26,850
And usually what we see in Argentum nitricum is that he is very gullible. He believes anything anybody will say to him. Especially at that stage.

167
00:45:53,240 --> 00:46:10,600
Believing anything, in that state with tremendous fear, tremendous anxiety he has to hold on to something. He has to hold on to somebody and it does not matter who is available.

168
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:33,840
Whether is the milk man or the doctor is the same, all the same. 'I feel I have cancer' and in that state, she may just take out her breast to the milk man 'Do you think it's cancer?'

169
00:46:52,760 --> 00:47:11,773
I had a case similar. My aunt who had a similar situation what she did, she prayed for 3 nights and 3 days and was gone. Arg-n will go for 3 nights and 3 days to pray to see if that treatment is good enough.

170
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:29,403
I mean if he does not have anybody available, will telephone somebody and say, 'I'm in a difficult state'. Also they don't want to say exactly the state and the severity in which they are.

171
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:51,340
'I have a little bit of difficulties, you see what happens I'm afraid', also they may say instead of I'm afraid, they may say 'my jaw goes like that'. Or 'I have some spasms in the right side, what do you think I should do?', 'have a warm bath'.

172
00:47:52,320 --> 00:48:03,763
Any advice, they will go and take a warm bath. At this moment the anxiety is so much that they have no rationality to discriminate what is he talking.

173
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:15,883
I'm talking to an irrelevant person who does not know anything and he advises me to do this. Why should I do it? There is no such thing, such rationality.

174
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:36,883
The anxiety, the fear are so great, overwhelming, they need to hold on to something. To warm bath, to sticking a pin in the occiput, jump 3 times right and 3 times left, whatever.

175
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:54,243
This is what I mean gullible at that state and they seem to lose the rationality really because they are under the treatment of a psychiatrist.

176
00:48:54,320 --> 00:49:02,403
And then in the morning they wake up with psychiatrist finally. And the psychiatrist says another thing.

177
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:12,313
And then he does whatever the psychiatrist says. In the meantime, during the night he has done everything else that everybody else had said.

178
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:37,640
This is because they panic so much. 'I'm not going to go out' and the idea that this panic state is going to remain. 'I'm going to stay in that, the rest of my life. I'm lost, I'm finished' and then it starts the trembling and then it goes to convulsions etc.

179
00:49:55,250 --> 00:50:09,432
When he is alone he becomes anxious, fearful of fainting and if you faint OK, what is the big deal with fainting? Faint?

180
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:20,083
See what happens, it's a good experience. Aah! Eventually she may try that also because somebody advised it.

181
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:39,763
But fear of fainting is tremendous fear, the idea of dying. See now how this jolly individual who enjoys his life, with good life, emotions, if shock happens !

182
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:57,013
And the idea of death comes into his life. This is the idea. The idea of death comes into his understanding. There is also death. I thought so far it was only drink a beer, having fun etc.

183
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:15,675
Now there is death also. This death can stop me from having all that enjoyment. And then the idea will overtake him, 'I lost everything', then next day there is nothing.

184
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:36,693
The anxiety subsides. The panic state goes away. And next night he is alone again and
 again it comes up with tremendous severity.

185
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:47,650
 The idea also that death is near, is approaching, is coming 'will get me'.

186
00:51:52,580 --> 00:52:02,253
And of course in these conditions, usually the stories that will tell you is that they call the ambulance finally.

187
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:12,513
They can reach that state that they cannot control themselves. They have to take the ambulance. The people who work in hospital they may see such cases.

188
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:29,283
They are coming there in panic state, trembling, in complete total panic and you may inject to them, not inject, pretend that you inject and still I believe they will calm down.

189
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:38,053
Because it's the company, the assurance, the doctor is there. He says, I feel so much better.

190
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:50,083
Especially when he talks with his doctor. He feels much better after talking.

191
00:52:54,320 --> 00:53:04,293
The fears are not always defined. What kind of fear? Fear of dying. Of what? Cancer. Heart disease It's not always defined.

192
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:18,203
But many times will be fear of heart disease or a brain stroke, if they specify on cancer. Mostly heart disease and brain stroke.

193
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:37,123
Sometimes you will see also, not to have a misunderstanding, you will see that some of these patients they will not confess to everybody, they will not say to everybody.

194
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:59,430
They can only confess to people who they feel they have a kind of connection with health. Whether it's a medium or a doctor, within this range. They can call the medium and the medium will say, well I feel that there is a cloud.

195
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:12,480
Ahhh! What shall I do to take out the cloud. He says, light up 3 candles. They will take it seriously, they will do it. I'm exaggerating.

196
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:28,550
Medium? You don't know what's a medium? A psychic person. I see in your past life you killed 7 persons. 'Ahhh! I did not know about it'.

197
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:37,283
They will take it seriously and discuss the possibility of having killed 7 persons. And that's why now they are destroyed.

198
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:56,333
It's not a joke. These are things that we have heard. I'm not improvising.

199
00:54:56,410 --> 00:55:13,083
The type of person is interesting to observe. And then you say, oh God this is Arg-n , I've been giving Kali-ars. and Calc., Lyc. and all this but it's Arg-n.

200
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:37,970
What is very interesting in these cases is also another thing. Before the panic state, before the panic becomes bigger and bigger, they have to run to the bathroom with diarrhea.

201
00:55:40,589 --> 00:55:49,720
Diarrhea before the panic state is almost exclusive for Arg-n. It's a keynote for Arg-n.

202
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:33,763
You see with their anxiety about health, in case it comes to their mind that they have cancer, they will have an impulsive fear for cancer.

203
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:44,253
The fear will jump out of the blue inside them and overwhelm them with the least thing, the pain, the pimple, the anything.

204
00:56:45,720 --> 00:57:07,683
Here it is, I got it, cancer. This is cancer and the anxiety will develop until they go and they want to be examined. He says, no you have nothing,
 it goes away. It's similar to Phosphorus.

205
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:22,593
We see it also in Sulphur this type of impulsion. But in Arg-n is much more accentuated, it's very sudden. It comes suddenly and overwhelms completely the individual.

206
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:39,360
In that panic state, there are not many remedies that will go.  Aconite, Kali-ars may go into such panic states. But not of that type, different.

207
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:26,273
When we have constant fear, constant anxiety, then we go to remedies like Agar., Nit-ac., Kali-ars., Ars., the fear can be constant.

208
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:48,223
With Arg-nis fitful, fear, panic. The idea is that he cannot logically explain things, neither he wants to do it. He wants somebody else to help him. It says, desires company, this is desire company.

209
00:58:48,300 --> 00:59:08,113
Because of the weakness, he wants somebody to hold his hand. You hold his hand and you say, 'don't worry, I am here'. 'I feel much better'.
The more you do it, the more he will feel good.

210
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:28,600
 The more you say, 'I'm here, don't be afraid', they will pacify. Tell this in a Nit-ac, in a Kali-ars and he will run out of your surgery and never come back again.

211
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:53,253
But Arg-n and Phosphorus need this assurance, to tell them. Assure Nit-ac and he will not come back. Assure Kali-ars, I mean superficially assure him, 'Oh, don't worry, this is nothing' he will not come back.

212
00:59:53,330 --> 01:00:05,363
Because these people are convinced in another way that they definitely have cancer. So if he says, there is nothing the matter with you, he is a fool, he does not know anything.

213
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:15,600
Arg-n will say, 'he knows what he is talking about. I have nothing', he goes away.
The same with Phosphorus.

214
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:37,680
Also because of that anxiety the Arg-n may become a kind of hypochondriac who takes all kinds of medicine. Whatever he can find, he can get hold.

215
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:56,283
When he travels he will take all his pills, all his bottles, the stethoscope, the blood pressure instrument, his nurse if he has, anything to prepare for death.

216
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:15,420
Death may come at any moment and also going away from usual environment, he immediately feels unsafe. The fact that he leaves the place where he knows, his friends. Becomes uncertain.

217
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:25,663
Where am I going there? Where is the nearest hospital? Where is the nearest doctor? Can I have the telephone number of 3 doctors?

218
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:34,163
One is enough. No, no in case he is not there, in the night if I cannot find him, give me 3.

219
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:53,923
And also the impulsiveness is on the type of medicine he will take. That means somebody says, you have this problem? This medicine is very good for you.

220
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,933
He will try it impulsively, fitfully, he will try it for a few days and will give it up. No, it doesn't work for me.

221
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:11,591
And then another one, another one, take some oil mixed up with vinegar and salt, it's very good for you. He will do it.

222
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:26,947
In the beginning, I think something is doing. Eventually nothing, gives it up, another thing, another thing and to the only thing they stick is Homeopathy.

223
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:35,643
They really believe but still they will try other things because until you find the remedy.

224
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:54,320
These are the patients who go from doctor to doctor, asking for electrocardiogram, asking for reassurance all the time. They're going to the hospitals.

225
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:19,123
And when there is no solution, this patient has gone to doctor after doctor and the anxiety continues, the fear continues, then they go into a state of gloomy apathy.

226
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:37,970
If they are alone, they sit in a gloomy state, an apathy state and only when somebody comes into the house, they are in company, they can exchange and they can have back their joy.

227
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:53,743
And that is why in Arg-n we say, it's better with company. You understand what kind of company, when, it's always when he is not in the anxiety state.

228
01:03:53,820 --> 01:04:03,683
He likes company to exchange ideas and to exchange their energies etc. But when he is in the anxiety state, the company is a must.

229
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:20,643
He must have a company. Otherwise he feels bad. And then the amelioration from company is tremendous. From dying goes into a state, within half an hour, where he has forgotten what he was having.

230
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,760
It is unbelievable the change that you can see.

231
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:42,703
Also he has a fear of seeing sick people, facing sick individuals.

232
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:51,553
That's why if a friend is in the hospital where everybody is sick the hospital, it's an prdeal for Arg-n to go and visit a friend in the hospital.

233
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:59,480
Because he is going to see this patient and that patient and that patient and say, oh my God all kinds of diseases in this world.

234
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:13,440
I can have this disease, I can have that disease, he improvises, that's why he has fear of hospitals because of that psychology.

235
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,653
And fear of fainting of course is very strong.

236
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:43,203
This fear of fainting can come at any time. For instance when they walk or they drive, they fear that I may have a fainting now and crash with the car.

237
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:52,443
And the fear becomes more and more, they get panic and they stop the car and get out and find somebody and say, 'can you help me?'

238
01:05:52,520 --> 01:06:03,443
He says, 'what is happening?', 'I don't feel well, can you drive me home?'. The fear is so panicky, so tremendous, so intense.

239
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:29,563
And that is why in Arg-n we have agoraphobia, fear of going out into the crowds, fear of going away from the house or they have to have somebody before they can go outside of their house.

240
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:39,643
Eventually they may stay all the time in the known environment. Otherwise they go into panic.

241
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:54,983
As we said before, the impulsiveness is a major aspect of this remedy.

242
01:06:55,060 --> 01:07:15,880
Impulsive thoughts, impulsive reactions, impulsive emotions, impulsive steps. What is an impulsive step? a jerky step.

243
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:29,120
It's this idea of impulsiveness which pervades the whole mental-emotional-physical aspect of Arg-n.

244
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:50,563
He walks in the street and a thought comes that as soon as I reach this corner, a brick is going to fall on my head.

245
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:16,123
The thought comes and the strange thing is that this thought comes but he cannot control it.

246
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:29,120
The thought comes that a brick is going to fall as soon as I turn, a brick is going to fall, a brick is going to fall and he can't go, he can't proceed anymore. And he changes way.

247
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:49,363
You see it's not an impulse like Alumina, Mercury and other remedies have impulses. This impulse is so strong that acts upon these impulses. This is the secret of Arg-n, acts, he cannot control.

248
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:59,703
Therefore as he goes, because the impulse comes that an accident will take place in the corner, he changes and goes backwards.

249
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:05,723
-But this is already a pathology?
-This is pathology already, yes.

250
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:13,723
This is quite deep already the pathology.

251
01:09:17,610 --> 01:09:30,893
And I have described many times different examples. To give you an idea the thought comes that he should walk on a particular way

252
01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:37,273
he should not step in the pavement on the lines, he should only inside or only on the lines.

253
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:45,600
Unless he does this, something bad is going to happen to him and he goes like this, he cannot avoid it, he has to do it.

254
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:55,293
You see the difference with other remedies which they do not have to act upon these impulses.

255
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:17,160
We talked about the weakness of the mind and this is what we meant. When a thought comes, an idea comes, overtakes the mind and he cannot but act according to this idea.

256
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:48,903
Kent wrote: when crossing a bridge or high place, the thought comes that he might kill himself or perhaps he might jump off or what if he should jump off?

257
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:55,723
And sometimes the actual impulse comes to jump off the bridge to the water.

258
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:13,033
He thinks 'what if I jump off this bridge and what if and what if' and then he goes near and he almost climbs the bridge to go over.

259
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:27,490
That is Arg-n because jumping from a high place is not only Arg-n, it's Aurum again jumping from a high place. An impulse to jump, what a difference.

260
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:43,680
In the Repertory you will see the same thing, Gels. the impulse to jump from a high place. What a difference! Staphysagria, it's another type all together who does it for different reasons.

261
01:11:44,880 --> 01:12:04,963
In Aurum is an impulse which has come through a lot of suffering. He says, 'here it is, here is your chance, jump to the freedom'.

262
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:19,603
Arg-n says 'jump, what if I jump, oh terrible! If he is in a balcony and he goes closer to the balcony and he looks down and the impulse comes and he goes closer

263
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:28,833
and the impulse comes more and he is lifting his leg when he understands, what a fool I am and he goes back.

264
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:39,013
He does not usually jump because if any Arg-nhas jumped really, we don't know it.

265
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:55,093
What we know is the descriptions of these people who say, this is exactly what happens. And what is more important for Arg-n is not only that

266
01:12:55,170 --> 01:13:10,583
 I'm jumping, I'm going to jump and then they go, but they look down and there they are, flat, lying in blood the brains are off and they see themselves down there.

267
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:22,013
They see the whole scenery, not only jumping but having jumped, they make with their imagination the whole scenery.

268
01:13:22,090 --> 01:13:36,953
These people you can see then going downstairs. Every time they go downstairs all the time they see themselves going rolling, landing in the end of the stairs.

269
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:42,530
And every time is the same impulse.
