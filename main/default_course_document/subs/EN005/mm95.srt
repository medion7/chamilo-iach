1
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:33,640
We''re going to talk on Aethusa. Did you have a look in Kent?

2
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:46,140
Then you know all what Kent describes about Aethusa?

3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,390
All of the seriousness of the condition when it comes first with diarrhea?

4
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:02,640
The vomiting together, the vomiting in curt which is characteristic, the aversion to milk

5
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:12,640
and if he takes milk, he brings it out, very soon it becomes curts and brings it out and the

6
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:24,890
seriousness in the appearance.

7
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,560
The look of the person, he is looking very seriously sick with big sorrows.

8
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:44,840
Now all this that Kent is describing, he is describing acute cases actually in an Aethusa.

9
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:53,260
He does not give us a real hint on what is the chronic state of Aethusa

10
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,980
and we tend to use Aethusa until now on acute cases only.

11
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:23,480
I prescribed Aethusa on a chronic case quite early, that was in 1965, 1966.

12
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:38,730
Since then I have prescribed a few cases and what I found out; it was the chronic make-up,

13
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,730
the chronic condition of an Aethusa patient.

14
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,990
You have to be an artist to describe the make up of a person and I don't have a talent and

15
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,980
I do not speak well English but I'll try to do my best.

16
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:20,760
The Aethusa patient is what they call 'a man apart' or 'a woman apart'.

17
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:33,730
That means somebody who is living with his emotions, quite strong inside but not

18
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:44,480
communicative, not communicating them, not expressing them so much, actually very little.

19
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,980
This general characteristic of that patient what brings about?

20
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:10,180
It brings about a stuffing of the sub-conscious mind, a building up of the sub-conscious
mind.

21
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,390
There are people, as I said, that have strong emotions but they do not show them.

22
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:28,650
They will feel like tears are coming into their eyes but they will not really cry.

23
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:36,890
So the emotions are there but there is a kind of control and it's a kind of deep conviction in

24
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:44,140
them that it doesn't work communicating or I don't know how they've come to that

25
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,890
conclusion that they should not communicate these emotions.

26
00:04:50,890 --> 00:05:03,120
So outwardly they may look like Ignatia but there is not the hysterical tend,
which is in Ignatia.

27
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:10,830
Ignatia after all breaks out in a kind of hysterical crying, where they don't.

28
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:22,000
But in the meantime the sub-conscious is full with the suppressions and the emotions that

29
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
these people get from the outside world.

30
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,010
Since they don't express it, they don't say it, they don't communicate it, then that

31
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,250
sub-conscious is always in a state of fullness, I would say.

32
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:42,250
Now what happens is when the logic, the logical mind sometimes goes to sleep, either on

33
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:48,750
the waking state or in sleep.

34
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,000
What happens is that they talk to themselves.

35
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
They talk to themselves either in waking state or in sleep and they will talk to themselves

36
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:16,000
when they are busy with their emotions, their emotions, their thoughts.

37
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:24,500
They go out by themselves and they walk and they are busy with their phantasies and that

38
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,500
is the time when they will start bringing out the stuff.

39
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:43,500
It is an interesting thing, I don't remember 'darkness aggravates' is Aethusa?

40
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,920
Yes, Aethusa is here, italics 'darkness aggravates'.

41
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:00,170
You will see in the Repertory, not in Kent's Materia Medica, quite a lot of hints of what I'm

42
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,670
talking about to you now.

43
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:09,590
Now with that loaded sub-conscious mind, they don't feel comfortable in darkness.

44
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,510
They are afraid that these sub-conscious things that they have been stuck inside,

45
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,340
they will come up with darkness.

46
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:27,700
The logical control will be lost and all these emotions will be stirred up and will come up.

47
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,700
So they are aggravated in darkness, they don't feel well in darkness and what they feel is

48
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,820
a heavy feeling in the chest, as if the air was thick and heaviness and then they have to get

49
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,840
up from bed and go and open the window and get some light inside and breathe and then

50
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,590
they will go back to sleep.

51
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:01,550
Now when they describe that state, you may confuse that state with a state that exists

52
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,260
with Lachesis or Grindelia or Cenchris or Carbo vegetabilis.

53
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:22,140
These remedies they have, especially Grindelia and Lachesis, they have an arrested

54
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,540
respiration, it is called.

55
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:33,760
The respiration is stopped and the moment that they go to sleep, they are on the process

56
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:39,030
of going to sleep, they feel that the respiration is arrested and they are going to be

57
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,280
suffocated and they jump up and they go and open the window.

58
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:51,780
Now the process is very much the same with Aethusa but in Lachesis and Grindelia is

59
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,790
much more a physical effect.

60
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:04,530
It appears that the vagus nerve, which regulates the breathing, is cramped or arrested or

61
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,530
paralyzed for one second.

62
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:13,530
During that one or two seconds that the whole thing happens, they feel that breathing has

63
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,050
stopped.

64
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,780
We cannot have an idea how that feels like but when these people describe it,

65
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,530
they describe it as something very dramatic.

66
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:37,270
Breathing stops and they cannot get another breathing and they jump up in terror and

67
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:44,930
they will go to open the window. In the meantime breathing starts again.

68
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,190
So it's not that physical with Aethusa, it's not that physical thing.

69
00:09:50,680 --> 00:10:03,630
It is the darkness and the oppression of the chest that they feel that the dark is something
thick; which comes inside and they cannot really breathe.

70
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,100
But there is an aspect on Aethusa which is very interesting.

71
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,520
These people as they are loaded up, full with emotions, they have strong and nice

72
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,520
emotions, good emotions also. It's not only that they have bad impressions.

73
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:28,270
The only thing is that these people they are apart, they keep apart, they live within

74
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:36,520
themselves, for themselves. They need some kind of communication after all.

75
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:45,270
They cannot exist with that self content condition, which they are living all the time.

76
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,770
Now what happens is that you will see these people as animal protectors.

77
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,020
They collect animals, they like animals, they love animals.

78
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:07,520
They consider animals as human beings which they understand everything and they can

79
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,550
really communicate with them and they can really communicate with animals.

80
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,270
They will say hello Jiji cat how are you this morning? Ah you are not well.

81
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:27,550
They have 10 cats, 20 dogs, this type of people and they communicate fantastically.

82
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:35,520
They are attached to the animals, not human beings.

83
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:47,770
You will not necessarily find a kind of grief in their history, it is their make up when they

84
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:58,270
decide that communicating with human being is not a pleasant affair and they have decided

85
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,520
instinctively not to do that and they communicate with animals tremendously.

86
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:15,020
I had a case describing that and what about animals? Are you afraid of animals?

87
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:29,550
Animals, my best friends and all that. She had 10 cats and dogs and one got sick,

88
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,850
so she took him to the doctor to see him and the doctor prescribed some medicine.

89
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,170
When she came back home, she confused who was sick and gave the medicine to another one.

90
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,670
When she realized that, she said I was in grief for one month.

91
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,920
I mean they will not describe that state as something pathological, they just give you

92
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,420
information, they think that this is a state which is natural.

93
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:07,660
You have to love animals and everybody has to love animals but there is a line between

94
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,700
loving animals and living together with animals.

95
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,250
It's interesting again in the Repertory, I think it says 'delusions of animals'.

96
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:31,410
How in the sub-conscious this element of animals has come. I think it's also there.

97
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:39,920
Can anybody see if there is? I don't have a Repertory with me. It is there.

98
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:57,750
You get the impression that there is a fear here, I mean Boericke just copies information

99
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,500
which has happened, he never puts together things.

100
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:08,000
So you get the impression that there is a fear like Calcarea carbonica.

101
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,120
Calcarea carbonica has tremendous fear, she sees rats and has delusions of rats and is

102
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:22,120
afraid of rats. This is not the case with Aethusa, it is the opposite.

103
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,110
I'll just give you an example of what is the fear of Calcarea carbonica.

104
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:43,280
In the island where I have a small house, I saw a small rat in the house and I wanted to get

105
00:14:43,780 --> 00:15:01,030
a trap. So my wife went to a shop and asked the man about a trap for the mice and he said

106
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,150
don't talk to me about that. That's why I don't keep it in my house, I don't want to hear about it.

107
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:13,650
So my wife told me and the physic was absolutely Calcarea carbonica.

108
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,570
So I said I'm going to test it, if that was a reaction really or he wanted to make a play or he

109
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,070
did really mean it.

110
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:28,520
So I went myself, I pretended I don't know and I said do you have traps for rats?

111
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:35,500
Please don't talk to me, I don't want to hear it.

112
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:47,160
I mean when he comes here for his tumor I'm going to give him quickly. He is a very fat

113
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:56,650
man with rosy cheeks and for Calcarea carbonica that information is absolutely valuable.

114
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:05,570
This, Boericke writes it but the way he writes it is as if he is afraid, it is not that he is afraid,

115
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:26,320
he is involved with animals quite a lot to the extent that it's best rapport that he has.

116
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:43,350
Now another thing which you can put together from the information that exists, there is a

117
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:51,400
real information that exists in the Repertory again on fear, on going to sleep.

118
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:03,350
It says there in the Repertory 'fear of going to sleep lest that he should never wake up
again'.

119
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:32,660
'Fear to close his eyes lest he will never wake up again'. You see in the Repertory,

120
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:39,650
Aethusa is italics. Can you find it?

121
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:50,650
Some Repertories have it with one, some with italics. I think we can leave it with italics.

122
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:01,940
I think this is a strong keynote symptom for Aethusa and it is really going to be there.

123
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:12,150
The moment that they close their eyes, that is when darkness really comes and their sub

124
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:21,400
conscious is aroused and they are living in an aroused state of emotional. They are not

125
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:32,300
calm, they are not serene people, they have strong emotions, they don't show them.

126
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:38,800
So outwardly they will appear like Natrum muriaticum or Ignatia but inside there are strong

127
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:54,050
emotions and I will give you another example of how they behave with animals.

128
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:05,050
Another lady who was collecting all these animals. Somebody went out with his dog I think,

129
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:14,550
together with the dogs from the lady's house attacked him and so much that most probably

130
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:22,790
he took a stone and throw it to the dogs and she said I wanted to take the car and run over

131
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:31,040
him, over that person that threw the stone to the animal. She has a tremendous connection

132
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:42,290
that exists with animals. When you give the Aethusa they will start discharging the animals.

133
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:07,960
They say now I don't have any more that kind of connection with the animals. That is

134
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:13,300
something which you feel perhaps is on the character or something like that but it is

135
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,480
pathology. And it is natural now, there is still the affection for the animal but it's on a much

136
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,460
more healthy basis.

137
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,460
I don't know that but they communicate, that's for sure.

138
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:52,170
Now again with this loaded sub-conscious, which is full of intense emotions, what you will

139
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,880
expect concerning their own people.

140
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:06,110
They are in the family, they don't talk, they will not express emotions and all that but they

141
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:17,850
fear that if somebody is hurt or died within the family, they will not be able to handle the

142
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,850
situation and they will go crazy. They say, no, don't talk to me about that possibility. How

143
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:29,100
you feel about your relatives and all that, if something happens? They say, don't talk about

144
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,350
that. I cannot handle it. I go crazy.

145
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:43,650
So you see again that part of aroused emotions and keep to their own but yet the emotions

146
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,400
are tremendously strong.

147
00:21:54,910 --> 00:22:04,100
All this information allowed me once to cure a great spiritual man I was treating.

148
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:15,320
He was looking so old that you would feel that death is coming within a few months.

149
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:26,820
The big (?) in the face and he has been to all kinds of homeopaths, all over the world

150
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,820
because he was travelling and teaching and things like that and nobody was able to help

151
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,820
him. He was in a very bad state, he was taking allopathic drugs, he was losing his urine, he

152
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:47,300
could not contain his urine, there was a chronic bronchitis which was going on, which was

153
00:22:47,820 --> 00:23:03,150
keeping almost a kind of dyspnoic breathing and there was a lot of mucus that was coming
out, tremendous weakness.

154
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:16,990
The emotions were very strong but very much apart, nobody really could communicate with him, come in real contact.

155
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:36,990
This is not enough to prescribe Aethusa but there was a sign, which is very characteristic

156
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:52,440
of Aethusa, if you see it. What it is? It is an eruption on the tip of the nose that they usually

157
00:23:52,940 --> 00:24:01,160
develop these people. Just a small eruption on the tip of the nose which can be recurrent,

158
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:12,540
come and go or can be always there, either a bit more or a bit less but always there.

159
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,570
So if you get that, that should make you think of Aethusa and also Causticum.

160
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:28,540
These two remedies have that but Causticum tends to have the eruption within the nostrils

161
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:40,870
mostly and in the septum. Aethusa used to have it on the tip of the nose.

162
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:14,620
Eventually you see I understood Aethusa. It's not by that time that I'm talking about in 65-

163
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:21,620
66 when I prescribed in this case. I still didn't understand Aethusa very much but you see I

164
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:29,370
went away from all the other remedies that I might have given him and I gave him the one

165
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:36,370
that opened up the case. He had a big reaction, it started coming up a lot of mucus and his

166
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:43,620
lungs were clearing eventually. He needed soon another remedy but Aethusa really did the

167
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:54,370
whole trick, where he had been seen (?) in England, Elizabeth (?) of America, any popular

168
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:02,530
homeopath in India, every prominent doctor all over the world.

169
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:07,790
He finally decided that Homeopathy is not going to help him and had resorted to allopathic

170
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:25,540
Medicine. This man by this time was 69 years old, he is still alive, he has been 85 where

171
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:31,790
really the first time I saw him, I thought three months and he is dead. I used to go because

172
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:39,200
I was interested in spiritual people and I used to go to every spiritual man that I could meet

173
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:47,900
and have a private interview with him. When I saw him for the first time in lecturing, he was

174
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,870
looking so old, just to give you the impression that I could not look at him and I was looking

175
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,870
at the trees. He was terrible to look at him.

176
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:15,120
What Kent describes as a very serious condition, near death where it can become acutely

177
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:23,620
and soon or it can take many many years like him to bring him into that state.

178
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:37,290
So I said I'm not going to see him because to over exert a man who is in the bring of

179
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:46,040
breaking down it is not right. So I decided not to ask an interview from him and he was the

180
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,820
only spiritual person I never asked an interview because I felt he was going to die on 1966

181
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,790
and still he is alive because of Homeopathy.

182
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:16,780
There is a loading up of these emotions and they break out as irritability as the menses

183
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,030
approach. As the menses approach there is a great building up and a kind of irritability,

184
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:28,280
which is quite strong just before menses. Two days before menses irritability is very strong.

185
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:34,290
Two days during menses also. So between the first days of the menses and two days

186
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:40,790
before menses, there is a strong irritability which goes away as soon as the menses are

187
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:49,030
away. Now there is a peculiar circle as the irritability builds up in women.

188
00:28:52,950 --> 00:29:08,450
The sexual desire diminishes and when the flow is over the sexual desire is shooting up.

189
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:20,950
Great desire after menses and then gradually going down until it reaches just a few days

190
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:29,870
before menses when it is nil, no desire. Before menses there is no desire and then menses

191
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:38,620
come and desire shoots up again; so it goes together, either irritability or sexual desire.

192
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:07,870
Yes, they will have their own theories in life, they are content in a way. They are self-

193
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:19,120
content, they seem not to need other people's theories to exist, they have their own and
they are content with that.

194
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:21,910
-Detached?

195
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:30,700
-Yes detached in an external way, that means they will never show the attachment but to

196
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:41,670
those who are attached, are so much afraid of losing one of them that can bring about

197
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:51,410
craziness. But this particular man, this spiritual man, had a brother who died at the age of

198
00:30:51,920 --> 00:31:00,660
28, 29 and he was 30, 31.

199
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:10,410
The shock of his brother dying brought about tremendous changes in him. He went almost

200
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:17,620
crazy. He had a big order, he left the order and big changes happened because of that
death.

201
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:32,950
He was very attached to his brother but not spoken out, not showing. The moment that

202
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,700
comes the death he is almost crazy, cannot handle it, the emotions are so strong.

203
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,200
-It is very much like China.

204
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:56,730
-Yes, in a way you may say but there is no these loaded up feelings that there is in China.

205
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:08,050
In China there is inability to perform in the world because they feel tired, they feel unable,

206
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:15,800
they feel their mind is not working properly and when they go to sleep what is lacking in real

207
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:21,500
life, they build up 10 times with their phantasies.

208
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:32,710
They will go to bed and they will phantasize becoming this and that, whatever, their

209
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:43,460
particular phantasies, they phantasize all these things. It's something totally apart from

210
00:32:43,720 --> 00:33:01,320
them and then next time they go and phantasy is coming up again and they go with phantasies, they build them up, they build them, 'building castles in the air'.

211
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:11,920
When they wake up in the morning and light comes on and look upon, what the hell, how did I do that?

212
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:21,670
There are similar states, we see the similarities with Ignatia in this case, with Lachesis.

213
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:29,170
With Lachesis when the flow goes away, youl have a big relief and the energies are coming back.

214
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:36,870
Now you may confuse that as Lachesis but Lachesis is relieved immediately,

215
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:44,170
when the flow becomes big there is immediate relief. You won't wait two days, it will be the first

216
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:52,080
day and that makes the whole difference. And then Lachesis jumps up from bed and you

217
00:33:52,850 --> 00:34:00,590
may confuse it and give Lachesis in a case of Aethusa because they describe that getting

218
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:07,120
up in the night, I feel suffocated. When they say suffocated, you don't go really and

219
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:16,500
examine what that type of suffocation is and you see the relief from menses and you say,

220
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,000
what else do I want? Lachesis. And you make a mistake of course.

221
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,000
No, they don't have that, no jealousy.

222
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:48,250
-I'm not sure I understand, are they talkative, do they talk, they are quite?

223
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:58,500
-When they are in company they will be talkative and they will be talking about a subject,

224
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:05,500
they will take part, they will tell their ideas and all that. It's OK if there is company and if

225
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:11,020
there is no company it's also OK. But what they will not do, they will not communicate their

226
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:21,000
deep emotions to others. Emotional relationships are very difficult for them to establish but

227
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:34,250
they will talk about ideas easily and they are in a company quite good, taking part and

228
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:46,250
talking about. It's not that they sit there like Staphysagria where she avoids talking in a company.

229
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:04,210
Yes, quite a lot but as long as the emotions are not involved. They will not say, I love you.

230
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:16,740
I have great affection for you. That is very difficult. But that is communicating on an emotional level.

231
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:22,700
Communicating on a mental level it's easy for them and they can do it easily.

232
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:29,410
Communicating on an emotional level is very difficult. That's why they need the outlet with the animals.

233
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:37,410
When they say, hello cat, it's a communication on emotional level, it's not on mental level.

234
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,410
That is what they need.

235
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,670
I have not seen it myself but if you had a case like that, where the connection with animals

236
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:26,930
is strong and has to be pathology, you can give it, if it's a child like that.

237
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,930
Especially these children now they must be affected by milk, they refuse to take milk or if they take milk

238
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:43,430
usually there is a diarrhea or an upset on the stomach. You will have to couple it with other keynotes.

239
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:55,090
There is another element, I remember I described to you that sometimes there is a kind of

240
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:12,400
flash, it's not a flash, it's a change of color in the face and the look of the face becomes quite wild.

241
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:20,240
They have a wild look in their face. They go to the mirror and they look that

242
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:29,240
change, there is a physiological process which is going on and changes the look of the face

243
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:38,400
and make it look wild. That can happen during the menopause, the climacteric period with a

244
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,400
woman or other times also.

245
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:14,150
The differences with Natrum muriaticum are that Natrum muriaticum people do not have that intensity in feelings.

246
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,600
Their feelings are quite subdued and less in intensity and they are more.

247
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,650
How can I say?

248
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:08,800
The way I would see emotions in comparison is... Nat muriaticum are like that.

249
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:21,800
In comparison with Aethusa, the emotions are like that.

250
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:41,300
So what is the difference between this and that is that this has pointed emotions and aggressive emotions, more pointed.

251
00:40:42,050 --> 00:41:09,870
These are stronger but there is no that element of maliciousness or it does not have to be maliciousness, it can be hurt.

252
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:23,130
An emotion which has been hurt and becomes pointed, becomes bitter.

253
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:39,660
When you get these people sitting in front of you, the one you will feel no vibrations that hurts you, with Aethusa.

254
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:58,380
With Nat mur you feel that what has happened to him it affects you also because there is a transaction on a level, as he sits there.

255
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:06,300
You understand his emotions are quite hurt and he is hurting you now also.

256
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:15,800
Aethusa are strong but not hurting. They have not been hurt so much.

257
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,630
These are very difficult things to communicate.

258
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:58,130
No, I can not say that there is a reason. It appears to have no reason for that inward

259
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:02,820
turning of their emotions and living with them within themselves.

260
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:10,740
It appears to be no reason,I don't know. Maybe we trace some reason later, I don't know.

261
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:31,410
This is information from 10 cases. But you see, you see 1, you see 2, you see 3, 4 and you

262
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:36,160
say what is the common element? Eventually you find out that there is some common

263
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,660
element with these people and you understand.

264
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:57,880
Temporary thing that comes and goes. Suddenly it becomes wild and stays there for some time and then it goes.

265
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:29,500
The mental ability. No, I have not seen but I expect this one is in a toxic state.

266
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:44,670
Aethusa on acute conditions can get in, then there is a kind of haziness or unclear condition in the mind.

267
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:49,670
But this comes together with the acute condition, which is a toxic condition mostly.

268
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:12,670
-Are any other remedies that we can confuse it with where animals become best friends?

269
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,930
-Not to that extend. That pathology I've seen it only in Aethusa but there are some other

270
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:35,920
remedies which will show quite a strong affection for animals and also Medorrhinum will

271
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:46,100
show an affection for animals, for nature in general and it includes animals.

272
00:45:50,100 --> 00:46:01,850
Medorrhinum will appreciate very much flowers and they become excited with flowers, seeing flowers.

273
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:19,230
The same way they can be very affectionate to an animal but at another if the animal does not obey, time they can become very cruel. This you will not see it with Aethusa. With Medorrhinum,

274
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:39,980
you say get out or if the animal comes in the room and spoils something which is valuable, they will hit the animal, they become cruel by that time.

275
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:59,520
After this incident is gone, then they become very affectionate immediately. They will look and try to take it into the doctor. after it

276
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:13,230
So there is an extreme in emotions in Medorrhinum, which can become cruel on one side and very sensitive on the other side.

277
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:29,220
-Will they also tend to be cruel to the animal, without the animal having done something all of a sudden?

278
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:40,270
-Yes, I've seen that also. For some reason they hit the animal without real reason.

279
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:55,270
Child abuses, yes. Some extremes which are going on.

280
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:38,020
They are affected by heat and they are mostly hot in the summer, not in winter in a warm day, they don't bother but heat during summer bothers them quite a lot.

281
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:59,770
They say general things that they don't like the heat, they are bothered, it's not that they

282
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:05,520
will have a headache or will have a particular symptom under heat.

283
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:17,110
Again with Lachesis you may be confusing it.

284
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:42,610
They will be coming for any problem, for psychological problems, for having a kind of depression or anxiety or whatever it is, anything.

285
00:49:45,860 --> 00:50:04,860
There is no particular department of action apart from the acute conditions where mostly the alimentary tract is affected.

286
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:17,030
But in chronic conditions... I had a case where it was a prostate gland which was building

287
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:41,940
In women you see Aethusa builds up before menses and after menses, in men it is periodical.

288
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,930
Periodically they get tremendous irritability and they look like Nux vomica.

289
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:59,990
This man got any remedy under the earth before he gave up Homeopathy. all

290
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:13,440
He was given this line, he was given Thuja, Nux vomica, Lachesis, Phosphorus, he was given anything.

291
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,850
They say there is a kind of change which happens in my face.  best

292
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:52,360
It's not a flash but the they can describe it is a flash and they look changes of the face and they just take another wild look.

293
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:07,520
I cannot say but I just remember that somebody mentions it because these things when

294
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:14,020
you don't know much Materia Medica they are just mentioned, they are passed by and we

295
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,770
try to find desires sweets, desires salt, something to hold on.

296
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,180
Like yesterday you saw what the problem was.

297
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:30,460
I was trying to find points where I can base a prescription and you see now the case?
