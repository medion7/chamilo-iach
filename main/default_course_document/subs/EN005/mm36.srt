1
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:36,109
Today I want to speak to you about Lil-t.

2
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,370
Little tiger.

3
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:05,999
What is the patient who needs this remedy? How this is produced?

4
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:21,679
It is produced basically out of a big conflict between morality and sexuality.

5
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:39,149
Sexuality is an energy which everybody has. It has to be released through natural means.

6
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:54,320
If this sexuality is kept inside and
it is aggressive or even more it is...

7
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:06,289
 ...quite strong and perhaps lascivious, perverted...

8
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:22,279
...this causes in the individual a fear inside that if he expresses such kind of sex, then the people will be against...

9
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,449
and then there is a repression of that.

10
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:44,259
And if this is really strong and the repression is equally strong, as a result we see a twist in the character of the person.

11
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:55,400
Then the person becomes snappish and nasty.

12
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:12,959
 It is a person who will attack. They are persons who become very angry with the least provocation.

13
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,880
 'I didn't say anything!'. 'You said it, you hurt me'.

14
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,439
'My God what did I say?'

15
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:42,200
They are so easily hurt. The hurt and
the reaction it is much more than in Nux-v.

16
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:54,129
You don't say in this case, it is irritable. It's not exactly irritability, it's the dissatisfaction inside

17
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:01,849
 ...because of the lack of sexual release a dissatisfaction...

18
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:18,170
...which causes dyspnoea, suffocation.
And that suffocation comes out aggressively.

19
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:37,219
I have said many times that this remedy is a remedy that is indicated mostly in women and mostly in unmarried women.

20
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,600
Not only unmarried.

21
00:04:48,250 --> 00:05:08,009
They have to have the element of sexuality repressed and not satisfied in their sexual life.

22
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:32,239
They will be like spinsters. A woman who has not married ever. Who has not ever had a love affair.

23
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:49,499
Because of repression of sexuality they stay aloof and they have such a character that the other person...

24
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:59,419
...cannot approach them very easily. Because they are so much hurt, so easily and so much attacking if they are hurt...

25
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:13,799
...that they put out any person who comes in contact or tries to be sexually advancing.

26
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:33,869
So, strong element of religiousness and strong element of sexuality. If the sexuality takes over, she may have...

27
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:50,639
...aggressive sex or she may have lascivious sex or she may go into a period of satisfying this need.

28
00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:11,679
Then the religious aspect comes over and this contact is stopped and then the Lil-t.  pathology develops.

29
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:21,849
It's very interesting because we talked about sexuality and repressed sexuality and then what do we see?

30
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:39,049
We see the woman is collapsing, out of order, is prolapsing, it doesn't function, you don't need it.

31
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:50,520
Then there is a very strong sense of prolapsus inside.

32
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:57,519
Therefore she would look very much like Sepia.

33
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,230
What is the difference?

34
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:11,599
The difference is that this remedy is much more active and powerful and with energy.

35
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:24,919
Sepia is without energy. Energy is lacking on the emotional, in the physical, in the mental. This one here is

36
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:37,479
very fast to react and to bring out arguments and say, 'I have done everything for you, you have done nothing for me'.

37
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,440
The religious aspect plays a big role here, in Lil-t.

38
00:08:53,780 --> 00:09:05,999
 Because the person will find solace in their contact with deity, whatever it might be.

39
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:15,539
The deity in Jewish religion is different, in Hindu is different, Christian is different, whatever you call it.

40
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:30,200
But they find solace in having a contact with
 the deity because they are duty conscious.

41
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:39,840
 This remedy is very duty conscious and
 there is a sense of hurriedness inside.

42
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,799
They have to do, they have to perform, to do this, to do that, 'I cannot stay'.

43
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,549
'But you are exhausted, why don't you sit?',
 ' I can't.'

44
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,780
And then he says, asthma...

45
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:08,829
...and gets up and go and digs the garden.
 He has to do, he cannot stay.

46
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:27,729
It says here profound depression of spirit. Of course you understand the life of such a person who becomes unsexual

47
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:38,419
but out of some kind of dissatisfaction in relationship.

48
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:49,939
They ask too much, they ask different things.  I mean it's not a matter of going into details of that type.

49
00:10:51,160 --> 00:11:16,879
Then from this state of aggression, nastiness and snappiness, they may go into a state of apathy. Depressed and apathetic.

50
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:27,600
Depressed, apathetic, religiously inclined...

51
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:48,599
...and the anxiety comes that whether they will be going to the next world and what is the condition and how can I be saved?

52
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,636
 There are questions which they don't bother many individuals but when it comes to that pathology...

53
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:03,559
... the question of salvation can become very bothering.

54
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:11,159
It's there all the time in the mind of the people who need this remedy.

55
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,659
So this remedy looks very much like Sepia.

56
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:28,179
It looks Sepia because they need to act.
 But the action is a sense of duty.

57
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:37,029
 I have a duty, I have two children and I have
 a husband and I have to look after them.

58
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:49,619
And you ask 'how is your relationship with your husband?' She says, 'no sex'. 'How many years?', '20 years'.

59
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,220
What's the problem? Asthma.

60
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,409
Coughing. And the cough is better on the open air.

61
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:08,769
They cough inside, they go outside in the garden and the cough stops.

62
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:17,089
You go to the Repertory, it is one of these strange, rare and peculiar that we see.

63
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:22,319
We see only two remedies to be in this rubric.

64
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:35,249
The fears mostly are fear of the evil, fear of something bad happening but that has the connotation of the evil.

65
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,879
Of something which is religiously bad.

66
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,379
So with Lil-t., what do you have to have?

67
00:13:46,730 --> 00:14:05,309
You have to have either the hurriedness and the snappiness together with a feeling of bearing down sensation.

68
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,680
They describe it stronger than Sepia.

69
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:29,970
The expression is as if the whole abdominal content would go out. The same way that it is described in Sepia.

70
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:49,479
And of course this condition is worse standing, of course and better lying down. Sepia is better sitting, crossing the legs.

71
00:14:51,200 --> 00:15:01,439
The hurriedness feeling you will not find in Sepia. The religious affection you will not find in Sepia.

72
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:10,720
We spoke in Sepia for people who are going into spiritual quest.

73
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:19,079
Spiritual quest is different than this one. This is the fear of God.

74
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:33,839
The fear that I will be punished, that I am a sinner and I want things which are sinful and I should not do it.

75
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:43,179
And then they say no and the organism is pushing them. It's a chemical disturbance.

76
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:51,600
You will be surprised how much.

77
00:15:52,440 --> 00:16:03,319
The chemical disturbances are leading you, it's not pure mental or choice.

78
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:13,689
By choice I'm this or by choice I'm that. You are not by choice, you are by chemistry.

79
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:27,789
You are your hormones. And that's why you prefer this or that way of expressing your sexual desires, needs etc.

80
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:41,479
There are very female hormones. Tarentula will go out and get somebody in the street and have sex.

81
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,689
And she goes back and says, what am I doing?

82
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:55,079
But next time she will do it. Lil-t. has that. I should not do it because God will punish me.

83
00:16:55,080 --> 00:17:02,119
And that conflict comes inside and
 then you see the snappishness.

84
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:08,800
Man or woman it doesn't matter.

85
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:22,300
Always the sense of duty. 'I have done my duty'. It's very strong in Lil-t.

86
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,120
'I have done my duty, so you better listen to me'.

87
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:44,059
They are quite domineering people, whatever they want it has to be done. The others have to do it.

88
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:52,269
A sensation of lump in the rectum. There is a peculiar symptom, if you ever find it

89
00:17:52,270 --> 00:18:07,080
which is a feeling of congestion in the chest if
 the desire to urinate is held, cannot be satisfied.

90
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:15,209
They want to urinate and there is a congestion in the chest. You have asthma and you have to urinate...

91
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:23,599
... before they urinate they have to hold, there is a congestion in the chest.

92
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:39,989
Such a remedy will have angina pectoris with the feeling of the heart being cramped in a vice.

93
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:49,479
This is common symptom which you will
 find in many remedies, in this pathology....

94
00:18:51,240 --> 00:19:00,219
...but you have to have the hurriedness
 and this kind of nasty character.

95
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,709
I have prescribed Lil-t.  exclusively with women.

96
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:19,919
I don't remember a male having Lil-t. You had a case?

97
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:30,879
-A male patient you prescribed, he had heart problems and when you gave him the remedy you said, it's the first time

98
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,479
 I have prescribed Lil-t. to a man.

99
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,129
-I don't remember it. Maybe.

100
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,880
If I could remember all the cases.

101
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:10,359
Also this confirms what I say. I don't know why but remedies are fitting more women than men.

102
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:26,829
Sulphur is more for men. Lyc. is more
 for men. Puls. is mostly women. Men also.

103
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:35,359
But exclusively men or exclusively
 women they are very few remedies.

104
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:51,239
Lil-t. it seems to have a peculiar connection between female hormones and this religious affection.

105
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:02,969
Verat. has religious affections, Hyos. has religious affections, Lach. has religious affections.

106
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:12,560
This religious affection is similar to Aur.

107
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:18,890
What God is going to do to me?

108
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:32,859
You will in such cases many times a lot of eczema with women, a lot of aggressive eczemas which are itching

109
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:41,400
and look like Croton tiglium, scratching and aggressive.

110
00:21:45,160 --> 00:22:00,016
Lil-t. comes to the house, she is a working woman and she has a maid in the house which she prepares the food.

111
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:15,739
And she comes to eat, she has the eczema,
and she puts the food, the mother, whoever.

112
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:39,310
Pushes the table, why? Because a little bit more in quantity onion that she would like.

113
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:55,759
And the mother is trembling. The monster is coming. Exactly the salt. 'I told you, you don't put salt.'

114
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:02,099
This kind of behaviour. I exaggerate,
 it's not all Lil-t. like that.

115
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,520
I just saw a case who prescribed Lil-t.  and maybe she is in the class.

116
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:24,480
But I exaggerate to give you the idea of snappish, nasty.

117
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:40,769
 And also you see that in this person there is no the satisfaction of love.

118
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:54,169
When there is a release on that level, there is a deeper satisfaction which goes away with Lil-t.

119
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,600
I don't know if I am able to communicate the idea.

120
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,600
That's all you have to remember, no more.

121
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:20,199
-I don't know who said but he said you can get a good picture because of the name, Tiger, Lilly. That is a soft person

122
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,979
 but if they go into this state, they are like tigers. You said it.

123
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:31,100
-Yes I said it. The way I describe
 it, you can imagine it.

124
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:43,799
You feel a person never satisfied but very duty conscious.

125
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,120
Very conscientious.

126
00:24:53,121 --> 00:25:08,640
So there is this God tells me to do this correctly, I have to look my children, my husband  I have to do this.

127
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:20,919
Then what about your organism? It needs this or that. No. This is not allowed. God will punish me if I do that.

128
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:34,319
Of course this has to be in the extreme because everyone has some problems in these areas.

129
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:43,799
And they think am I Lil-t. No, you are not but there are degrees in that.

130
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:54,919
And Lil-t.  has this suppression to strong degree and then the problem develops.

131
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:07,880
In the end of each Materia Medica you can ask me some questions, if you like to complete the picture.

132
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:22,929
-How do you get a sense of the sexuality? Do they tell you or can you pick it up?

133
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:46,799
-You're treating a case and she has a prolapse of the uterus and you think of that, then you ask about the sexuality

134
00:26:46,800 --> 00:27:05,280
and then you get an answer. It depends if the person is married, a married woman maybe she has tolerated some sexual action.

135
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:19,199
Then she will downplay the idea of
sex and then you ask about religion.

136
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:32,919
Then immediately you see a different response on that. Religion yes I have. Then you investigate a little bit more.

137
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:49,679
Without intruding too much because these are deep issues. And we know quite a lot what is happening in an individual

138
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:57,199
especially when we spot the remedy and we see the problems. We understand almost immediately

139
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,239
what has happened. We can tell events
 of their life almost. Because if you know that

140
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:11,159
 this is the context, you can describe more or less the situation. That does not mean I have to intrude

141
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,529
but you put some questions because they are sensitive issues.

142
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:22,559
You put some questions and you get the answers and from that you get the impression.

143
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:32,399
If they are honest people they will tell you and people around Lil-t.  are very important.

144
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:47,329
Because if they give you this idea of snappishness and easily hurt, they will go into a retreat, he hurt me, out.

145
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,749
I go to the garden, I go inside.

146
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:02,029
You get some other people who are more open and they will tell you more. If you go to America, you examine

147
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,979
an American woman they will tell you everything.

148
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:18,920
American women are liberated in these matters.

149
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:24,919
Is this correct, Mr. America?

150
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,959
You can discuss with American woman anything almost?

151
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:45,479
-There are some Lil-t. s that I have treated who have become non denominational reverends because they had such

152
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,269
a strong desire to serve that they themselves have become reverend.

153
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:58,639
And they liberated both in the religious and they also maybe gay and be liberated in the sexuality as well.

154
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,560
-That's correct.

155
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:18,190
Also if you look at the American plays, the serials, the 'bold and the beautiful'...

156
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:35,149
...and sometimes you just click like this and the American woman is very much towards this.

157
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:44,519
Because the liberation on the one hand made her believe that she can liberate and she can enjoy whatever.

158
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:51,959
If the other time comes the conscience and says, what are you doing and then the conflict comes and under

159
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,589
 this conflict become like tigers.

160
00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:05,450
American women I'm afraid. They will kill you. What did I say?

161
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,720
Mur-ac. is another very interesting remedy.

162
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:48,860
We have to pass from one state to another.

163
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:58,239
We need a little bit of quietness before we can plunge to another level of pathology.

164
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:22,139
Mur-ac. is of course famous for an exhaustion which we call total exhaustion on the physical level.

165
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,840
It says the lower jaw hangs down.

166
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:46,800
They don't have enough strength to bring it. When you go to sleep, when everything is relaxed like this.

167
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:57,839
There are semi comatose states with so much exhaustion that they cannot even turn in bed.

168
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,240
They don't have enough strength to turn in bed.

169
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:20,739
 You put them in bed, here is the bed and here is the pillow and the people are lying down there on this pillow.

170
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:36,569
They cannot stay on that pillow for more than half an hour. Slowly they slide down and they find themselves with the head here.

171
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:41,559
They cannot get up and go back to the pillow.

172
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:54,939
This is the case where usually you will find in acute cases, with fever, whatever type. They use to call it

173
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,919
blood poisoning fever, typhus also.

174
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:10,729
But also you will find it in exhaustive diseases which are affecting primarily the liver.

175
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:23,159
You know the liver is the one organ that gives energy and that is why Mur-ac. is one of the main remedies

176
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:28,839
for liver dysfunction and liver affections.

177
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:38,359
To give you the dimension of exhaustion, I'll give you an example of a patient.

178
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:54,519
I have a patient in United States and they telephone me, he is in terrible state with blood pressure 250...

179
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:19,399
...terrible pressure, young man, 38-39, total exhaustion and I said 'OK you come so I can treat you'.

180
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:30,000
He says, 'it's not possible because I can't move'. He is totally exhausted. What can I do?

181
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:38,729
 They phone again and they decide to come. They start a journey from Los Angeles to New York.

182
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:54,099
 Stay 3-4 nights where he slept all the time. NY-London sleep,  London-Athens sleep...

183
00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:08,919
...and I was this year it was my summer holiday and he had to come. My secretary picks him up from the airport in Athens

184
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:17,759
 to bring him where I was having holiday. It was not here it was in another place where he could come with the car.

185
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:26,839
He comes there and I see this young man totally exhausted, we knew each other very well, he says....

186
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:33,839
...'Hi George where is my bed?'

187
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:48,760
The secretary says, he was on the back seat of Mercedes, sleeping all the time, the whole journey, he was sleeping.

188
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:58,079
That is the type of exhaustion for Mur-ac.

189
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:07,479
Here we have a high blood pressure and most probably at this time I was thinking of pheochromocytoma...

190
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:17,240
supra renal gland, malignant tumors which they cause such high blood pressure and exhaustion.

191
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:32,939
I think catecholamines which is measuring how far this may have been, they have been raised

192
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:37,559
there was a big suspicion for this malignancy.

193
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,700
I asked him one question.

194
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,159
 What was the question?

195
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,519
-If the urine comes slowly.
-No.

196
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,839
-Do you like meat?
-No.

197
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:40,279
He came with his girlfriend. His girlfriend brought him, she gave me the whole story, what has happened actually.

198
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:51,759
He exhausted himself very much in his work, totally exhausted. And he used some marihuana and then some drinking

199
00:38:51,960 --> 00:39:05,839
and push himself and suddenly collapsed. They tried to give Homeopathy, they tried to give Acupuncture, no effect, nothing.

200
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:21,659
He was there about two months in that state and he had to take high blood pressure medication.

201
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:50,639
I will tell you something that you can remember. Nat-m., Mag-m., Mur-ac. there are all very much worse in the sea.

202
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:05,159
The Muriatic element, I don't know why it has a bad reaction near the sea.

203
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:21,709
So when I asked him this question, he says all my life I don't like the sea, I don't go to the sea, I'm worse in the sea.

204
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:33,849
So was it possible that this Mur-ac. was even his constitutional remedy? Most probably yes.

205
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:45,639
Because under Mur-ac. in 3 days we started going out for a little walk.

206
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:54,959
Can you get up? Yes I can. Can you walk up to the corner? Yes. We go back, we come back, OK.

207
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:06,959
Fourth day we go further. Fifth day we go further. Sixth day, 7,8 day we leave the place and we come here in Alonissos.

208
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:20,520
 9th day we stayed in Rusum and he started jogging slowly.

209
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:31,199
10,11 day he starts jogging all around Rusum
 you know it goes round and up again.

210
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:47,359
1,2,3 times very good. On the 17th day he was feeling so strong, he said 'I'm going back'.

211
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:58,440
He was near the sea. But after the
Mur-ac. he was not swimming still.

212
00:41:58,441 --> 00:42:07,559
But you don't have any more this
 sensitivity to the sea, exactly.

213
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:23,209
But that is the type of exhaustion we have with the Mur-ac. Another thing that the Mur-ac. has due to this weakness...

214
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:40,039
 ...we have easy hemorrhoids which are very painful. They are mostly coming in pregnancy and if a woman

215
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:52,559
is suffering a lot during pregnancy with hemorrhoids which come out and they have to push them in

216
00:42:52,560 --> 00:43:06,879
and very painful to any touch any walking, then most probably the child will be born with hemorrhoids.

217
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,479
The baby can have hemorrhoids as well.

218
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:18,519
It comes as a hereditary predisposition and the baby has hemorrhoids.

219
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:30,439
 So due to this symptom it has been found out that babies who have hemorrhoids, they need Mur-ac.

220
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:36,719
I remember Pierre Schmidt when he came to Athens one day and he was examining me, putting questions.

221
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:49,759
One of the questions was what you will give to a baby just born with hemorrhoids? I said, Mur-ac. My compliments.

222
00:43:51,230 --> 00:44:05,679
This is something which I have not seen but something that Pierre Schmidt and others confirm

223
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,640
that Mur-ac. will have an effect.

224
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,119
Involuntary stool while passing urine, urine passes slowly...

225
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:23,399
... all this a description of the exhaustion and the muscular paralysis.

226
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:37,519
It is a remedy, this weakness can lead to muscular paralysis eventually.

227
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:51,799
You will have to differentiate Mur-ac. and Bapt. also because Bapt. is also very exhausted during fever.

228
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:57,840
Both of them they have offensive secretions.

229
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:08,319
The perspiration is offensive, the stool is very offensive and you will have to differentiate between the two.

230
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:14,719
A big point of differentiation, who can tell? Because we did Bapt.

231
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:30,320
Another thing that you will see immediately in the face.

232
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:42,159
 Mur-ac. is pale. Bapt. is brownish, reddish.

233
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:56,319
Mur-ac. is much more exhausted than Bapt. Bapt. even when she is in semi-comatose state and she will come out

234
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:05,559
and give answers, there is some life in Bapt. In Mur-ac. there is no life.

235
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:19,039
Mur-ac. of course you will have to differentiate with Stann.

236
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,840
How you can differentiate with Stann.?

237
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:43,429
The discharges in Mur-ac are offensive. In Stann. they are not.

238
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:58,599
The complexion no. Both Stann. and Mur-ac. will be whitish.

239
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:10,609
-Stann. is unable to speak or worse from speaking. Mur-ac. I don't think so.

240
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,919
-Mur-ac. doesn't speak at all.

241
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:28,119
-Stann. is in respiratory and Mur-ac. is physical weakness.

242
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:40,679
-Most of the Stann. affections will affect the respiratory tract, they will affect the power to speak especially.

243
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:45,999
That means if they speak, they become very exhausted.

244
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:55,920
And that is very characteristic. Stann. is a tubercular remedy, affecting the lungs primarily...

245
00:47:55,921 --> 00:48:02,410
...Mur-ac. affecting the liver primarily.

246
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:18,559
So if you see total exhaustion, almost like this in asthma cases you will not go and give Mur-ac. You will give Stann.

247
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:30,080
You see the Stann. they cannot make a move, they just get up a little bit and go to sit there.

248
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:36,030
 They collapse.

249
00:48:36,031 --> 00:48:41,600
This you don't think of Mur-ac.

250
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:51,959
Mur-ac. you will think mostly in fevers and where liver is affected and there is this kind of exhaustion.

251
00:48:51,960 --> 00:49:02,679
Therefore you will need Mur-ac. in cases of hepatitis with exhaustion.

252
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:15,180
Also in Mur-ac. you will see the organs in a collapse state in general.

253
00:49:15,181 --> 00:49:23,639
You will have prolapse of the uterus, as well prolapse of the rectum.

254
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:30,119
-We said Mur-ac. will have this restlessness. How does that fit to the exhaustion?

255
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:35,240
-It's an inner restlessness which I have not seen it externally.

256
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:56,879
It writes here restlessness. You can say this is inner restlessness it's not the restlessness that you see externally.

257
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:13,159
Also it says 'loud moaning persistent' and then it says 'suffers in silence'. These are things in the Materia Medica.

258
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:28,080
What it means actually is that when you see these cases fever and this exhaustion you will hear...

259
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:38,759
This is the persistent loud moaning.

260
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:44,799
And suffers in silence.

261
00:50:49,740 --> 00:51:00,639
He is almost dying, the way that you see him. You ask, do you have fear of death? No. No fear of death, they don't care.

262
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,639
It's so much the exhaustion.

263
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,639
 Fear? No fear.

264
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:21,599
 They don't bother, 'let me alone'. It is like Bry. Many times we confuse Bry. with Mur-ac. actually.

265
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:30,999
Because Bry. has that collapse state, that exhaustion, especially with respiratory problems.

266
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:40,679
And Bry. also does not want the contact. Suffers in silent you can say, the same thing.

267
00:51:48,760 --> 00:52:05,560
But Bry. can be confused with Stann. in problems of the respiratory tract and especially asthma.

268
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:14,999
-George I have a question concerning the patient you are talking about. You said he had exhausting life...

269
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:28,639
...but did you also find a deep grief coming to such a bad condition? Did you find emotional grief?

270
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:40,000
-No.

271
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:55,719
 You see the Mur-ac. state is a state you have to perceive it, the exhaustion is so much that they don't care.

272
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:04,199
They slide down, somebody who goes to death position.

273
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:14,639
It says suffers in silent , all these are expressions that you have to put them in context and the context is

274
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:22,279
that state of exhaustion that makes you totally indifferent, no fear.

275
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:35,439
If there is a kind of exhaustion like that and there is anxiety and fear of death, with such kind of exhaustion

276
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,549
 then you go to other remedies; they cannot be Mur-ac. Most probably is a Phos. case.

277
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:53,359
 Bry. is a remedy that usually will be thirsty, so you will see the thirst which is not in Stann.

278
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:07,719
Then Bry. is much more like Mur-ac. in their dealing with others. They will say 'leave me alone'

279
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:13,219
by meaning, by signs, by whatever.

280
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:27,960
I have been in a Mur-ac. state and in Stann.
case and I know the situation exactly how it is.

281
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:40,040
I didn't care, let me die. Why not?

282
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:54,799
It says vertigo on moving the eyes or lying on the right side. This is the only remedy in the Materia Medica

283
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:03,569
and I have tried to give it on that, it will not act unless there is the exhaustion.

284
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:09,719
You have the vertigo, unless you have the exhaustion, you will not give it.

285
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:20,720
This case of Mercury that we have been discussing, he remembers the exhaustion.

286
00:55:20,721 --> 00:55:30,479
 The exhaustion was like this, if you remember. But I did not give him Mur-ac.

287
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:40,079
 I gave him Bell. Why? Because the exhaustion was together with a severe headache.

288
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:54,359
I remember the patient symptoms more than the patients many times. It was that type of headache

289
00:55:54,360 --> 00:56:11,880
the context was not a Mur-ac., it was not Stann. He had vomiting, headache, exhaustion, he says I can't lift the water.

290
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:23,973
 This strong man lying there with 40 fever, not being able to lift the water, you think of Mur-ac.? No.

291
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:38,039
Because we didn't speak about headaches. In this case we speak with 250 blood pressure and no headaches.

292
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:44,619
He didn't complain of headaches. Of course blood pressure is not always accompanied by headache

293
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:54,559
but in this high blood pressure, there is some effect on the head.

294
00:56:54,560 --> 00:57:06,500
The head feels at least congested and full. In the Mur-ac. is rather the giving up of the organism.
