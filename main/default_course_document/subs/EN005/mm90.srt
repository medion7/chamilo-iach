1
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,119
The desires and aversions
 have to be strong.

2
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:52,120
Wants always to wet the mouth.
 It is a characteristic of?

3
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,849
Ars., Bry. also.

4
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:14,160
Which is the remedy that wants to wet the mouth but they are not going to drink it?

5
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:32,420
Spits it. They want to wet the mouth because the mouth feels very dry but they will not drink it. Even a little bit of water they will not drink it.

6
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:55,000
There is a remedy which has tremendous dryness on the mouth to the extent that
their tongue sticks on the palate.

7
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:10,160
Nux moschata, yes.

8
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:19,889
Tremendous dryness, sticky mouth
and the tongue sticks on the palate.

9
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:31,999
They need something to water the mouth but they don't want to eat and they spit out water.

10
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,450
We do some comparisons.

11
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:49,799
Which is the remedy which is the
most thirsty in the Materia Medica?

12
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:01,880
-Phosphorus.
-Which comes close to Phosphorus?

13
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:05,799
Bryonia. And?

14
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,570
-Natrum muriaticum.

15
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:26,599
-OK let's go more specific. Let me see, which are the remedies which have great thirst for big quantity on short intervals?

16
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,689
Which are the remedies which have thirst for
 big quantities on large intervals?

17
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,919
Bryonia, which other remedy?

18
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:19,099
Sulphur and Natrum muriaticum and it's Phosphorus. But Phosphorus can have short intervals also for large quantities.

19
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,639
-It's only Bryonia then.
-No, it's not Bryonia. It's capital.

20
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:37,320
The others are in italics.

21
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:56,279
Sulphur, Natrum muriaticum, Phosphorus
but they can have also shorts intervals.

22
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:15,219
What is the thirst? It's the need for
water in the human body.

23
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,440
From the pathology point of view
 what do you find in such cases?

24
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:39,639
 If they are seriously sick, what you
will see as a pathology?

25
00:05:48,460 --> 00:06:01,729
They are not able to ask for water because they are in a case of comatose or semi-comatose state, what you will see in their pathology?

26
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:14,249
A phenomenon which is called dehydration. We see in such cases easy dehydration.

27
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:29,559
A person who is dehydrated very easy, it impresses you how easily he dehydrates, then you give Phos., Bry., Sulph., Nat-m.

28
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,319
Which are the remedies which they
 have great need for sweets?

29
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,079
-Arg-n..
-Another one?

30
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,149
-Lyc..
-China.

31
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:18,470
-Arg-n. yes, there is a desire for sweets with a difference he desires things which contain a lot of sugar. Plain sugar and a lot of sugar.

32
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:37,709
Arg-n. will need sugar and a second characteristic is that in most of the cases if they eat the sweet, they become worse.

33
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:46,969
What is worse? The stomach. It creates a
lot of burning, belching, bloatedness.

34
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:54,519
Now the second remedy that
desires sweets really is Sulphur.

35
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,009
What is the characteristic of Sulphur
desire for sweets?

36
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:11,120
They desire the sweets especially
  in the afternoon after sleep.

37
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:29,120
Also a lot of cream.
With white cream on top.

38
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,850
- Sulph. will also be aggravated?

39
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:51,520
- Yes but not as much as Arg-n.
 It's not the characteristic.

40
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:04,279
When you have one symptom only,
it says eats sweets and becomes worse.

41
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:12,319
The first thing you think is Arg-n. There are
many other remedies aggravated by sweets.

42
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,519
But we're talking about something
which is stronger.

43
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:55,099
Lyc. also likes a lot of sweets and takes all kinds of sweets but the difference here is that he likes sweet liqueur but the sweet liqueur but will make him sick.

44
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:08,920
That will make him sick like the Arg-n.
gets sick from the sugar.

45
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:30,520
And they like it because it's very sweet but it makes them worse. They cannot digest it. It's too heavy for the Lyc.

46
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:46,619
There is another remedy Chin., which is in the Repertory which I have not seen a big desire for sweets on Chin.

47
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:59,369
Chin. is not one of the very desirous sweets remedy. In spite of being in black letters.

48
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:09,779
On the contrary we have
 Calc. and also Phos.

49
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:22,290
With Calc. we have the same desire as Arg-n. desires sugary sweets, sweets with a lot of sugar.

50
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:40,969
And both Arg-n. and Calc. they require in their drink, a lot of sugar. Arg-n. in a cup of tea 2-3 spoons of sugar.

51
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:55,889
Phos. is known for his desire for sweets
but especially chocolate and ice-cream.

52
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:07,829
So you see from one symptom you can differentiate one remedy from another.

53
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:31,209
Nat-m. has not big desire for sweets and it's not mentioned in the Repertory I think I've added it because I've seen Nat-m. desire for sweets not as strong as this remedy.

54
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:39,449
-What about Kali-c.?
-Kali-c has desire for sweets not very strong but desire for sugar

55
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,600
They need the sugar.

56
00:12:51,950 --> 00:13:02,559
- How strong would be if you have a person who eats constantly chocolate and also has salt on his bread.

57
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:13,689
- Arg-n. most probably will be the indicated remedy, because Arg-n. has also a
very strong desire for salt.

58
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:26,959
Also Phos. yes. But usually to see
both so strong, you see it in Arg-n.

59
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:38,539
In Phos. either you see desire for
salt too much or desire for chocolate.

60
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,869
- You mean either,or?

61
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:56,440
Either. And the other one is less but to have both very strong. Putting in bread salt in order to eat it and then eat a lot of sweets usually is Arg-n.

62
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:11,800
In case there is very strong desire for sugar and chocolate in a person. He had such a strong desire for chocolate that he had to make his own bar, 5 kilos a day.

63
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:23,409
He had to use a lot of sugar on the meat on the bread on anything. He wasn't satisfied.

64
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:43,570
- Usually that type will be Calc. Why? Because Calc. has the tendency to get fat whereas Arg-n. does not have this tendency. They eat but they don't put so much weight.

65
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:56,089
- She has said she's afraid of going over a bridge. It's quite a wide one but she couldn't ride a bicycle on.

66
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,669
- That makes it Arg-n.
- I gave her.

67
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:13,519
-What about the Lyssinum and the
chocolate? How often you see that?

68
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:31,250
- Lyss. can have desire for chocolate, sometimes strong but I've seen say 10, 20 cases of Lyss., 2-3 have this desire.

69
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:41,360
Med. has also both desire
for sugar and salt. Like Arg-n.

70
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:58,570
I think also Sulph. has before
 menses desire for sweets.

71
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:03,890
If I look in my Repertory
 maybe I will confirm it.

72
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,930
-Sulph. and Arg-n.
