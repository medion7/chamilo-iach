1
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,389
Nerve remedy, neuralgias of all types.

2
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:45,279
And this kind of pain that we see in trigeminal neuralgia where the pain is really nerve pain.

3
00:00:51,920 --> 00:01:01,610
It's not a defused pain, it's along the nerve, you feel it is absolutely an inflammation of the nerve.

4
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,640
Left sided remedy.

5
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:18,719
 it's a remedy also that is connected with problems in the eyes, especially high blood pressure, glaucoma.

6
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:36,739
The heart many times is involved. You have the pains in the heart very much aggravated.

7
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:48,919
Also I want to make a point which I have noticed when people say about the heart and they put the hand like this

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,189
 with Spig. it can be less diffused.

9
00:01:53,190 --> 00:02:00,919
The pain is more like nerve pain and it is aggravated very much by motion.

10
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,441
All angina cases are aggravated by motion, there is no question.

11
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:20,449
But the intensity that counts. When it's aggravated with the least motion, then it can be Spig.  case.

12
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:38,439
Also Spig. will show some symptoms of Lach.  Spig.  will be aggravated lying on the left side and the pain

13
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,199
will go upwards towards the carotid artery.

14
00:02:51,980 --> 00:03:04,869
It's a left sided remedy, aggravated lying on left side and the pain like Lach.  from the heart will go up in angina.

15
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:20,419
Lach.  is very characteristic that the pain goes upwards and many times it constricts the throat.

16
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:32,410
With this remedy we have worse motion, which is not so much with Lach.

17
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:40,479
Worse lying on the left side and the pain shoots upwards.

18
00:03:43,950 --> 00:04:01,999
In Spig. also I have seen sometimes extending the pain from the heart to the back and it can also go towards the right side.

19
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:22,179
A characteristic of Spig. is a pain over the left eye here where it is neuralgic pain extending or radiating

20
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:29,139
 in different parts especially on the back.

21
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:43,540
Which is very similar with another remedy
 in migraines, it's very similar with....

22
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,360
... Bryonia.

23
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:07,960
Spig. also is very strongly noted for pinworms.

24
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:22,079
 I have not seen it much effective in pinworms situation.

25
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:40,879
Pinworms are small worms white which they come out .

26
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:54,999
When you have the high blood pressure, glaucoma, then you have this feeling of pressing on both eyes

27
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:05,759
 is different than the neuralgia, the migraine pain where it's over the left eye, affecting the eye but extending back.

28
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:26,429
Another great keynote for Spig. is the fear of needles, of pointed things.

29
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:35,019
Which is the other remedy which has that?
Sil., Hep. also.

30
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:53,330
Who has fear of needles here?
3-5 persons.

31
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:15,769
We have to understand the intensity of a symptom because if something which everybody has

32
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:24,319
 the intensity has to be very great in order to take it as a symptom, as I have said many times.

33
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:32,559
The most failures in prescribing come from the fact that we take a lot of symptoms, as symptoms

34
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,599
 when they are not symptoms. A lot of failures come from that.

35
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:50,119
And then a lot of success comes when you pick up one or two keynotes and you prescribe.

36
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,999
-Could you please describe the fear of Spig. a little more in detail, what do they do when they are confronted

37
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,599
with needle? Do they get paralyzed, how do they react?

38
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:14,119
-No, neither freeze nor paralyze. They just say, I can't have an injection. They will try to avoid an injection at all costs.

39
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:24,019
If you threaten them with a pin of course they will react very much but it's not normal that they will be threatened.

40
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,599
So they live with this fear, no problem.

41
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:34,320
The moment the doctor comes and prepares the thing, he says, no, no, I cannot have it.

42
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:47,359
They will react more and more depending on their personality whether they will kick the doctor finally or not.

43
00:08:47,360 --> 00:09:01,029
If they say, I have a fear but I can overcome it, this is not a symptom for Spig. or for Sil. or for Hep.

44
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:13,299
I have been described with Hep. a man in the army, sitting and they had the needle, giving vaccination

45
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,119
and they were undressed, one after
 the other, they give the vaccination, they go.

46
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:30,189
He says, 'this is in front of me, I see the front man getting the needle and I collapsed'.

47
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,969
He collapsed before the needle was touching him.

48
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:50,599
But that kind of reaction it may be with Sil. as well or it might be with Spig. but the idea is that the person will tell you

49
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,989
'I don't like needles, I'm afraid of needles'. That is enough.

50
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:06,309
There are certain symptoms which we have differential points, not in all symptoms.

51
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:19,639
Desires warm drinks, it's another strong symptom. Aversion coffee, who has aversion coffee?

52
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,650
Who likes coffee?

53
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:52,619
So if you take as a symptom desire for coffee, forget it. Where is it going to lead you?

54
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:06,319
Many times I have been told desire for coffee, I ignore it. Aversion to coffee yes, worse from coffee yes.

55
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:24,079
-I would like to know which are the main remedies for occiput headache which extends to the forehead

56
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,599
and the opposite direction as Spig.

57
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:41,409
-The opposite direction as Spig. is Sang. but it's on the right side.

58
00:11:52,400 --> 00:12:06,909
Camph. is an interesting remedy but difficult to be recognized unless you have an acute case where you have

59
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:20,999
a lot of diarrhea and vomiting and collapse and anxiety, restlessness, coldness internal, external.

60
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:29,479
Hahnemann was prescribing it for cholera because we have not seen cholera. Has anybody seen cholera?

61
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,110
Where, in which country?

62
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,479
 In Nicaragua. Who else has seen cholera case?

63
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,740
Where? In Morocco.

64
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,760
Did you see it in the hospital?

65
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:09,649
 You were a doctor there? No. Who has seen it as a doctor?

66
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,299
Can you describe the case that you have seen?

67
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:23,760
-I've seen a lot of cases of cholera, easy cases and very difficult, severe cases of cholera.

68
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,459
 I don't know what you want me to describe.

69
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,609
-The severe case.

70
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:38,359
-The severe cases I have seen started suddenly with sudden, very strong diarrhea, watery diarrhea

71
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:46,059
 nausea and vomiting and absolute weakness.

72
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,889
Very strong weakness, sometimes half an hour or one hour after the diarrhea it starts, they can't move

73
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:59,040
from one side to the other and the problem is they can't keep any water. As soon as they drink water, they vomit.

74
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:10,319
  Immediately they dehydrate and they will die.

75
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,029
-The outside coldness?

76
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,059
-Yes they are freezing.

77
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:40,289
-Of course these cases we see can be similar to this kind of cases, not exact fortunately because in case you have

78
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:53,029
such a case, real case of cholera, then of course you know that you have immediately give infusion and then give Camph.

79
00:14:53,030 --> 00:15:00,519
Which is the other remedy which has similar picture of that kind of collapse, diarrhea, vomiting?

80
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,039
Verat., very good.

81
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:21,739
And the peculiar thing is while the surface is cold, she wants the covers off. That is only Camph.

82
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:41,990
 If you get this, external coldness, you touch and it is like metal. And yet they want the cover off.

83
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:53,559
Also here the sudenness of the appearance and the intensity. This is a remedy that develops very fast its pathology

84
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,639
when it concerns with the digestive system.

85
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:12,729
And you go almost into a state of collapse, the patient you will see, cold, cold, uncovered and thirst, anxious

86
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,680
restless and then collapsing.

87
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:24,520
Thinking of complains ameliorates, is a
very peculiar symptom that if you get it...

88
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,950
  usually thinking of complains, aggravates.

89
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:46,360
During the peak of the acute, she may be making noises.

90
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:59,039
This kind of things which indicate that she needs help.

91
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,320
What remedy is this sneezing, very strong sneezing?

92
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,080
 Sabadilla.

93
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:35,399
Sensitive to sunlight is quite strong keynote. You get sunlight eruptions and Camph. is one of the remedies

94
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,640
that you have to take into consideration.
Which are the other remedies?

95
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:57,119
 Getting sun eruptions is a special pathology, I think of the liver, which produces eruptions with the exposure to the sun.

96
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,599
Camph. is one of the main remedies that you have to think of that.

97
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:09,209
When a person tells you that I get skin eruptions, wherever I'm exposed to the sun.

98
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:29,519
The remedies which are worse with the sun
are mostly the Nat-m., the Bell., Glon., Puls.

99
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:48,679
Was anybody here in Alonissos when we
 treated a retarded child with epilepsy?

100
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:53,290
A retarded child with epilepsy, a child which was about 4 years old, he was totally paralyzed

101
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:13,959
 no contact at all with the environment.

102
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:21,999
The mother, the father would talk but he had no contact with anybody.

103
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:39,049
Strabismus is usual characteristic of this remedy and what is the characteristic is frightful distortion of the face

104
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:49,159
this is what characterizes the nervous activity on the face, especially during convulsions, during epileptic fits

105
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,479
they are terrible to look.

106
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:02,850
So retardation, childish, it behaves like a child, with strabismus: Cic.

107
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,479
 Behaves like a child without strabismus?

108
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,989
Bar-c.

109
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:27,319
Behaves in a violent manner with
strabismus then the remedy is Stram.

110
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:39,839
Violent distortions of the face with opisthotonos, Cic.

111
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:19,679
All epileptic fits have some distortion of the face. But there are some grades in this distortion.

112
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:34,519
This remedy has frightful distortion. You think
 that the face is like grand guignol.

113
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:43,649
You know the grand guignol pictures we see with the distorted faces? That gives you the impression with the Cic.

114
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:56,219
There are cases actually that you will see in epilepsy or you may see suddenly in children, in the hospital

115
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,469
 when you are in the hospital and you need that remedy.

116
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,659
Especially when there is this strabismus.

117
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:24,120
If you don't have so much distortions and you see this opisthotonos, in convulsions or epilepsy you will think of....

118
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,800
...Strychninum.

119
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:49,550
It is a remedy that sometimes will be treating convulsions after concussions in the head.

120
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:57,130
Post traumatic epilepsy.

121
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:09,539
Answers abruptly, you have to connect it
with the idea of not fully developed.

122
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:23,959
The way that they will answer is pathological, it's not answer abruptly in a normally developed person.

123
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:33,559
Moaning and groaning during sleep, shrieking and shouting before convulsions, that' s a good symptom.

124
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:55,119
In these remedies you will just need the idea of the remedy. Otherwise you may never need this remedy in your practice

125
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:04,129
unless you are in a psychiatric ward or working with epileptic children.

126
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:12,520
But a normal homeopath very seldom will need this remedy.

127
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,759
 Retardation of whatever reason always gives the idea of Cic.

128
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:42,319
Dig. Jaundice with heart involvement,
this is what you have to remember.

129
00:24:46,840 --> 00:25:04,099
What is the heart involvement? The heart rate goes down tremendously 42,45,48 this is called bradycardia.

130
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:11,910
Whenever you see strong bradycardia
 the first remedy you are thinking is Dig.

131
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:24,969
People who have an effect on the stomach where they feel nauseous the stomach feels empty

132
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:33,239
and the stomach is a sensitive point in the organism.

133
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:50,399
Anguish with nausea, anxiety from
 motion, a great fear of heart attacks.

134
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:59,359
They don't want to move in case the heart
will stop, which is the opposite with Gels.

135
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:06,399
Gels. feel unless they move, the heart will stop.

136
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:19,149
Slow pulse, it should be written with number 24 letters, that means huge letters like this.

137
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:32,809
Bradycardia is the main... Dig., I have never
given it where the heart rate was over 65.

138
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,719
It has to be low, under 50 is the best if you get it.

139
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:53,880
Actually in research I have suggested that there is a possibility for us giving a remedy to show the effect

140
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:59,129
of high potency in bradycardias.

141
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:11,269
You get under 50 in a hospital and you agree with the chief of the hospital to give every time you get a patient

142
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:19,849
with heart rate under 50, you agree to give a dose of 200.

143
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:26,889
Dig. 200 and see within a few hours the pulse rate.

144
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:39,039
 This is an easy research that will show the effect not curing all the cases, some cases will be cured.

145
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:45,880
But definitely Dig. will raise up the pulse rate.

146
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:57,759
 So you have the weakness on the stomach, the weakness in the heart the nausea, the anxiety  which hits the stomach

147
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:06,799
 and every stress hits the stomach which is similar in a way to.. what is the remedy which is very sensitive

148
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,060
  to the stomach area?

149
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:21,310
Nat-c. and also Kali-c. yes. What Kali-c. has?

150
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,879
Fear arising from the stomach.

151
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,329
Like which other remedy?

152
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,760
 Mezereum.

153
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,119
 Tremendous fear arising from the stomach.

154
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:47,139
But when we talk about pathology of the stomach, that means you have gastritis, duodenal ulcer

155
00:28:47,140 --> 00:29:00,389
 you have cancer, we're thinking of Ant-c.
Ant-c. is one of the main remedies that affects the stomach.

156
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,820
Anxiety which is felt mostly in the stomach...

157
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,119
...this is a keynote of Ars.

158
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:26,520
Dyspnea with constant desire to breathe deeply.

159
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,519
You will see an individual anyhow who has really a weak heart.

160
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:41,759
Weak heart, weak stomach, jaundice.

161
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:50,219
This remedy will be indicated many times in severe cases of jaundice.

162
00:29:50,220 --> 00:30:03,239
When you have the nausea, you have the slow pulse and you have the anxiety that the heart will stop.

163
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:32,419
Mez. is a remedy of the skin, one of the most aggressive and malignant skin eruptions.

164
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:38,180
When we say malignant, I mean malignant.

165
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:51,339
I had to prescribe this remedy in a case that came out of the hospital, 25 years with skin eruptions but what kind?

166
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,532
 I had no experience, she was bandaged all over.

167
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:06,469
 She has just come out of the hospital without any effect, they said we can do nothing.

168
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:15,520
And then she wanted to show me and she uncovered the legs.

169
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:22,919
My God, I wanted to throw up, it was terrible!

170
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:40,639
It was thick cracking, oozing underneath, a green yellowish stuff and it was terrible to look.

171
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,639
She said, do you want me to uncover this? I said, no that's enough.

172
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,960
 Otherwise you have to give me a remedy.

173
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:15,779
Mez. generalizes its action. It is in the face, it is in the lids, it's in the eyebrows, in the neck and the itching

174
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:32,529
 the scratching, the suffering is tremendous. But mostly what you will see or you will differentiate is the thickening of the skin.

175
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,269
It makes the skin thick and cracks and peels off.

176
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:55,759
Mentally they do not have stamina. They
do not understand, they do not perceive.

177
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,980
 They seem to be in a state of constant confusion.

178
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,487
There is a great sensitivity on the scalp also.

179
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:14,879
   The scalp has a great sensitivity and if you just touch the hair, the head, it's very painful.

180
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:23,390
Leather like thick crusts, hair stick together.

181
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:32,879
it's a chilly person aggravated by cold and there is a great desire for fat.

182
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:43,139
They like fat in the same way like
Hep., Sulph. and Nit-ac.

183
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:52,400
Sudden pains followed by chilliness also is a keynote.

184
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,639
The chilliness they describe is very deep to the bones.

185
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:13,119
They say I feel cold in my bones, this is an expression which they use many times.

186
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:26,509
It looks like Graph. very much but you will
 see the desire of Graph. is not for fat.

187
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:38,719
We have aversion to sweets and
aversion to salt, and desire for chicken.

188
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:52,409
Also in Graph., as we said, there is this discharge like honey, this is typical.

189
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:17,540
-I've been giving Mez. 3 times for a state after they needed Hyper. much earlier, in traumas of the spine and the back region.

190
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:27,839
Skin eruptions 15 years, 3 years., 7 years after such accident. All of them got skin eruptions, the child

191
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,859
and the grown ups and all went much better.

192
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:41,369
-After accident where the spine was injured and then they developed skin eruptions.

193
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,629
-Yes, much later.

194
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:49,199
-I do not know that, I have not seen it but it's interesting what you say. You have seen 3 cases like that?

195
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:57,159
-Yes.
-Very good. Mez. worked in the 3 cases?

196
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:15,440
-I don't work for such a long time, the child is 2 years now and went away but it was not the constitutional remedy.

197
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,340
She has been needing Tub. after that. And the grown ups, one has been needing Sep. but she never came back

198
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:39,639
 and one woman had terrible, horrible itching for 7 years and as a young girl she had this bike accident.

199
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,719
Later on she needed Sepia.

200
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,979
-I'm not sure you can connect it
 with a trauma or it was accidental.

201
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,479
-Can we ask one more question about the remedies you just discussed?

202
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,159
What's the difference between anxiety arising from the stomach and anxiety felt in the stomach?

203
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:13,769
-The anxiety in Mez., which we said, we're talking about anxiety together with fear of dying.

204
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:25,009
An anxiety together with fear of dying, that's something difficult to describe.

205
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:33,159
Definitely they will point out that the anxiety comes from the stomach and rises and overwhelms

206
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,169
 the whole person and the feeling is, they are going to die.

207
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:54,959
Actually in the case which I described to you, this is an anecdote,  I gave a remedy and as you know

208
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:12,769
I was working in South Africa, in construction business and the next morning, they were calling me after the Mez. 200

209
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:23,039
 in this woman, because she thought she was dying. They could not get me of course on the telephone

210
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:36,539
 because I was not at home, I was at my work. Fortunately I was not there and it was a proving of Mez.

211
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:43,360
and a very good sign that the remedy was dead right.

212
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:55,719
It created exactly that anxiety and when the evening I came back  when they could get me, the anxiety was over of course.

213
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,348
 This woman got a new skin in 45 days.

214
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:19,039
 She got a new skin the whole body. She was terrible, 25 years in the hospital and after a few months

215
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:36,319
 believing then that this whole thing has gone, the poor husband brought me an envelope about that thick with notes

216
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:47,979
 of South African money and he said 'I would like to give this to you'. I looked I just saw how thick it was, just the notes

217
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,180
and I said, forget it, take it back.

218
00:39:52,510 --> 00:40:05,679
He said, 'this is nothing what I give you. We are not believing, we are outcasts for 25 years, for the first time

219
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,599
in our lives we can go out, we can enjoy, we went to the cinema.

220
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:22,249
And you have freed my life, that's why I give you this money'. I still said, no. He said, you have to take it.

221
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:32,999
I said, no I don't take money, I work in another work. He pressurized me, in the end he said, buy books.

222
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,143
 I said, I have all the books I need, I don't need the money.

223
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:49,229
Of course I didn't use to take any money all these years and now I take money from the rich people only.

224
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:57,959
If I know they are rich, I will accept. If they don't forget it, you cannot persuade me.

225
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:17,879
Mez. 200 one time, I didn't dare to repeat it, not just because of reading Kent and all that but also because of the reaction.

226
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:25,439
He said in the evening, 'we have been trying to find you all the time because we thought she was dying

227
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,257
 that was the end'. Finished. The woman was lying down, having all this anxiety feeling

228
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,959
  she said it came from the stomach. She described exactly how it is.

229
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:50,349
This is one of the very first cases I treated. About 3 months after, I started reading Homeopathy.

230
00:41:52,190 --> 00:42:03,449
And they say, Kent said, if you see a mental symptom arising after your remedy, you suppressed it

231
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:12,539
and things like that. Then of course I had palpitations because I didn't know whether there was a suppression.

232
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:24,269
Later on, what I'm teaching you now and I found out it was not like that. When you have a keynote symptom of a remedy

233
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:31,359
  appearing after your prescription, this is almost
 a sure sign that your remedy was correct.

234
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,359
Even if it's a mental symptom.

235
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:46,799
A lot of things have changed.

236
00:42:48,830 --> 00:43:02,799
Also the skin looks raw because usually they have to keep the skin clean by different ointments

237
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,719
 they put and it looks raw.

238
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:16,799
You see all this neuro dermatitis which is burning and it's scratching the whole night, they can go on scratching.

239
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:19,569
It's terrible situation.

240
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:34,629
I remember a German woman, she has been treated with Homeopathy for years in this condition. Forget it, nothing.

241
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,160
Only Mez. helped.
