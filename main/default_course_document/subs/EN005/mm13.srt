1
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:42,944
You read the information, then what type of the person you get that Ant-c. is?

2
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:53,911
It says, aversion to be looked and to be touched. Romantic and sentimental, especially in moonlight.

3
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:02,441
Emotionally immature, ailments from disappointed love, introvert, emotionally unbalanced, solar plexus

4
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:11,671
stomach or entire digestive tract is affected by emotion. Children irritable, dissatisfied, complaining, peevish.

5
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:30,551
It's what we call an emotional remedy. A remedy that is guided by the emotions, it's driven by the emotions.

6
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:50,910
The child becomes very emotional and what is the seat of emotions?

7
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:59,631
It is considered to be the solar plexus.

8
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:12,881
So the solar plexus in this remedy is very much affected and the area of the stomach is very much affected.

9
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:32,401
So you get an individual who is getting all the time, with every emotion, pain in the stomach or pain in the area of the stomach.

10
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:42,641
A cramping pain on the solar plexus then that will bring you the idea of the Ant-c.

11
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:53,881
Examine this person and find out whether this is an intellectual person or a person with emotions.

12
00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:05,701
You find out it's a person with emotions. Likes and dislikes. 'I don't like him. Don't look at me'.

13
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:20,871
You see the children they are acting very much like the child you saw, the Calc-p., very similar.

14
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:42,511
With the difference that will not be peaceful even with his mother or his father or his brother and he will react

15
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:54,191
emotionally to what he wants. He wants this and he will not stop screaming and moaning.

16
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:10,101
And the mother gets desperate, I want to kill him. He says, give me this, give me that.

17
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:19,261
There is a little bit more aggression than you saw there, more aggression and more feelings.

18
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:25,591
Not so much this restlessness as you saw in this child.

19
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:37,561
It says the child... aversion to be looked or to be touched which is closer to which remedy?

20
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:12,311
Chamomilla! Cham. and Ant-c. are very similar.

21
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,640
You did not know that? Now you know.

22
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:23,151
In children that are suffering with digestive problems.

23
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:34,551
And they are moaning and groaning and they do not know what they want, the remedy is not Cham., it's Ant-c.

24
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:45,441
In children where the teeth are the problem and the child is acting this way, then the remedy is Cham.

25
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:56,111
Cham. acts during the time of dentition. This does not act on the time of dentition.

26
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:18,993
Ant-c. is a person who can express a lot of love, a lot of emotions, a lot of affection. They can express when they want to.

27
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:32,730
That means when there is some object for their adoration.

28
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:49,681
They can express when they fall in love and they fall in love especially in women we see it.

29
00:06:49,730 --> 00:07:00,581
 Many times the idea of falling in love without needing very much the physical contact.

30
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:20,060
It's a romantic idea which can be expressed through that remedy. These people are romantic.

31
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:34,411
They like the nature, they take a walk in the nature and especially if there is moonlight, fullmoon

32
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:51,741
then the emotions are becoming very overwhelming. And they really express their emotionality in such an environment.

33
00:07:52,600 --> 00:08:05,991
So you get the idea of the romantic element, the problems with the stomach, you get headaches which are

34
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:31,791
aggravated in the heat of the fire. Ant-c. is generally aggravated by heat but heat of fire is much worse.

35
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:46,071
Ant-c. people will say, 'I cannot sit by the fire'. You know fire places you have in your countries because most of you

36
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,511
come from cold countries, you have fire places.

37
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,401
Ant-c. will never sit next to the fire. Immediately they will feel unwell.

38
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:15,001
Also there is a possibility of alternation between stomach problems and head problems.

39
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:22,921
Headaches alternating with stomach problems. In Platina we said what?

40
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:33,650
Mental conditions alternate with sexual hyperactivity.

41
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,531
You see the essentials? These are essentials.

42
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:53,471
You get a patient and tells you that I suffer with headaches, when the headaches go away, I get stomach problems.

43
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:01,191
One of the main remedies - there is another remedy also which has that, Nat-c. - main remedies

44
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,541
Nat-c, Ant-c.. Immediately it comes to mind.

45
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:22,091
You get alternating states on the mental level. Platina is one of the possibilities. Alternating states on mental level.

46
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:35,601
Anger is transferred into laughing. Laughing is transferred into weeping and vice versa, these hysterical reactions.

47
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,600
You stop and you say, well I know your remedy.

48
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:55,761
-I wish to ask you if this alternation is not characteristic symptom for Ant-c. because I saw also on other levels

49
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:02,271
on many levels, many alternations and I wish to ask you about your experience.

50
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,691
-No wait. There are alternating remedies, there are different remedies.

51
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:22,211
In this remedy the alternation is between stomach problems and headaches. That is what alternates.

52
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:38,321
There is a great keynote which shows the digestive dysfunction and that is what?

53
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:44,440
It's a tongue which is totally white.

54
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:52,401
Not only white, it's like snow, as if snow has fallen on the tongue.

55
00:11:53,690 --> 00:12:14,551
How you see the snow when it first falls and leaves a little bit underneath. Mostly is white but not glistening white, not like this white.

56
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:30,031
This is glistening white. The tongue of Ant-c. is like cotton, they say cotton. You understand this idea?

57
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:40,911
You see the tongue and it's not something compact. Very white, not compact, like snow.

58
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:53,391
Once you see it once, you never forget and if you suspect Ant-c., you say put your tongue out.

59
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:01,331
These are little secrets. Maybe the others take the case, case, case, symptoms, symptoms, symptoms

60
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:07,111
and you say open your mouth to see your tongue.

61
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:16,111
The other one takes, takes, takes, 1 hour, 2 hours and he says, Sulphur. OK nothing. Give Ant-c.

62
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:24,791
It's like this. Homeopathy is like this. You don't have to analyze the character, project about the character, no.

63
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:32,621
What you are interested in is to get the characteristics. You got the characteristics, forget about his sexual life.

64
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,121
 All this is interesting.

65
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:49,391
Why is interesting? Because each one wants to know what the other is doing, that's why it's interesting.

66
00:13:50,440 --> 00:14:02,621
And if you go on this way, you will not learn but if you say let me see, Ant-c. acts this way.

67
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:15,161
Then you are learning but if you are curious, you are not going to learn. Curiosity is not good.

68
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:21,111
Curiosity is only to understand the remedy.

69
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:31,481
And don't jump into conclusions. Because each one has his own personality, character etc, and does not belong to the remedy.

70
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,281
It belongs to the personality.

71
00:14:52,910 --> 00:15:02,861
I never had a problem though I always had somebody next to me. Now when I take a case I have hundreds next to me

72
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:12,271
 but in the beginning I always had at least one person sitting next to me. And almost very, very seldom had any problem

73
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,351
asking any question and the patient feel uncomfortable answering.

74
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:34,181
Why? Because I was not asking out of curiosity. I was asking out of need to learn and the patient would understand

75
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,511
 immediately that and would give you all the information you need.

76
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:48,351
In spite the fact that somebody sitting there, not talking, who is this person, what is he doing?

77
00:15:48,400 --> 00:16:02,831
And when there in tete-a-tete, one to one people are difficult to talk. But if they see you are really interested in their health

78
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:12,164
and not in their personal life, because if you are interested in the personal life then you start hearing stories and stories

79
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:24,331
 which are irrelevant to the case. What you want to know is, there is a element in this case that can give me a new information?

80
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,960
Worse heat, in open fire.

81
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:45,820
Desire for cucumbers also is a keynote.

82
00:16:50,840 --> 00:17:01,771
I treated a case of pneumonia in the hospital in Athens, in children's hospital where has been given antibiotics

83
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:14,131
and the child was in a terrible state. Lying almost breathless and with high fever and the parents asked me

84
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:19,781
to go to the hospital and treat it. I said, 'what he wants to eat?'

85
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:26,121
They say, 'only cucumber'.

86
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:46,321
Now there was a TV session and the father came in the TV and said, 'I will tell you my experience. I had my boy

87
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:53,201
he was dying in the children's hospital, in that department and Vithoulkas came, gave him something

88
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,630
 and next day we took the boy and we went out'.

89
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:06,631
Because of cucumbers, it's unbelievable but it is like this.

90
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:27,361
Digestive problems of course. All kinds of digestive problems which mainly effect the digestion

91
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:38,191
affect the stomach, the solar plexus but also the rest of the digestive tract. From the beginning to the end.

92
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:58,021
No, sour cucumber. Cucumber. Fresh cucumbers.

93
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:22,840
Sour they don't like. It makes them feel worse, especially wine which is a little bit sour, forget it.

94
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:30,370
It can bring headaches, pains in the stomach, all kind of problems.

95
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,321
 Just remember that and if it happens and you just ask to see the tongue.

96
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:54,381
If you know the remedy, immediately you go and ask certain key questions. You get the feedback.

97
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:05,391
Actually this was the complication of a chicken pox, if I remember well. Pneumonia after chicken pox or something like that.

98
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:16,101
And the child was really dying in the hospital, under allopathic treatment.

99
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:52,521
The keynote for Berb., this thing that will put you the idea is the radiating pains.

100
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:03,081
The pain starts on one point and goes different directions.

101
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:14,211
Where you will find these pains usually? In what conditions?

102
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:31,531
Conditions mostly of stones, kidney or gallbladder stones. Especially kidney stones produce this type of radiation.

103
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:56,601
So therefore the constitution of Berb. is a constitution that produces stones. Usually such constitutions

104
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:12,711
 are people who hold in. They keep inside, they hold inside the emotions.

105
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:24,851
These people may want to communicate but they never communicate on a deeper level, on their real emotions.

106
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:33,231
And it seems something is cramping and is holding back the elimination.

107
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:40,851
 And therefore the kidneys especially, they become full of stones.

108
00:22:49,050 --> 00:23:08,491
In Berberis also you have people suffering with arthritis where the different joints are suffering in different times.

109
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:22,151
You get some pains on the left shoulder joint and then after this is going away then there is the knee, then there is the hip joint.

110
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:38,151
Then there is the elbow joint. Then there are the  wrists and the joints are suffering in continuation or in rotation.

111
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:49,760
So we call these, wandering pains. These pains are characteristics also of Puls.

112
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,191
 and Formica rufa, very good.

113
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:10,681
They can come back to the place where they started and then again they go away. They don't stay in one place.

114
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:23,781
So either they move around or they radiate, the pain radiates. In case of a lumbago where the lumbar region is affected

115
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:35,281
then you may see the pain radiates all over the abdomen. From the back it radiates around the abdomen.

116
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:58,551
Usually these people do not have enough stamina but they are not also very tired. It is an organism

117
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:18,651
who looks tired but it is not the tiredness that we see in other remedies like Stann., like Ph-ac., Mur-ac. and all that.

118
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:33,631
We also have another keynote; solitude is unbearable.

119
00:25:36,190 --> 00:26:01,321
I mean not having a communication and having to live with themselves, they are not doing well. They are people of action.

120
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,711
Not of meditation.

121
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:48,631
You have pains which are like the pains of Eup-per. Because they feel the muscles as if they are beaten.

122
00:26:50,280 --> 00:27:05,061
Which is very characteristic. When in a case of influenza, all the muscles feel beaten, 'my whole body feels as if I'm beaten'

123
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:10,911
 the first remedy that comes to mind
is not Rhus-t., it's Eup-per.

124
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:28,871
So this remedy has rheumatic pains on the muscles and arthritic pains and the limbs feel as if beaten.

125
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:55,831
Urethra it says burns when not urinating, better after urination. These are mechanical things which happen.

126
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:09,321
Because this remedy produces a lot of stones. So if a stone is there and it is stuck and by urination it goes away

127
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:21,071
 the pain is relieved. That symptom just confirms the idea that this remedy is producing a lot of stones

128
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:28,140
and maybe small stones which are going out frequently.

129
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:52,581
Also, I don't see it here, the remedy is aggravated by motion like Bry. Motion aggravates the pains.

130
00:28:52,630 --> 00:29:10,031
- I want to ask something about Berb.
If there is a case with kidney colic and the patient has aggravation

131
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:18,031
through moving, we give Berb. And then perhaps if he is a little bit better but his condition changes

132
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:25,921
and he gets better from moving, then what should we decide?

133
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:38,471
-Most probably the remedy was wrong and now you need Rhus-t. But it is hypothetical.

134
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:48,221
And hypothetical is difficult because you can add or subtract essential things from a case.

135
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:53,381
And once you subtract something essential, then it makes no sense.

136
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,951
So it's better we speak on real cases.

137
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,951
-Would it be a contraindication if there is a kidney colic and the patient is better from moving to give Berb.?

138
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:20,440
-Better from moving? If at the same time the pain is radiating, really radiating, you can give it.

139
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:11,121
Borx. will affect mostly the upper part of the digestive tract causing aphthae, very painful aphthae.

140
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:45,640
In order to confirm that this is a case of Borx., you have to have fear of downward motion.

141
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:59,591
  Even going with the lift which goes down slowly, they have an anxiety.

142
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:18,811
Going in a car, sometimes the car goes up and then goes down, it's like the soul comes out. They are frightened by this motion.

143
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:29,071
You put the child down, when you have the child and you put it a little bit down, like this...

144
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:39,040
and then you put it slowly down, the child is OK.

145
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:57,231
He has diarrhea, give Borx. It has inflammation in the eyes, it doesn't matter, Borx.

146
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:28,061
We have the sensation of cobweb on hands and face. They feel there is some cobweb and all the time they will do like this.

147
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,991
Trying to get it out.

148
00:33:53,980 --> 00:34:12,561
Also we have leucorrhea which is very profuse, it's watery and the feeling that is running out. It's very thin.

149
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:31,591
Something which is like Phos., why? Because these people have sensitivity on sudden noises

150
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:44,711
 and that's why they express fear during a thunderstorm. But mostly what they are bothered, is sudden noise.

151
00:34:53,500 --> 00:35:07,671
When they study, when they are concentrated into something and there is some kind of noise, even not strong

152
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:15,680
 it can jerk them. Coming back to their bodies.

153
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:31,151
 Of course these are the children that can never go into a swing. Forget it. They will not even try.

154
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:44,971
There is an external trembling on sneezing which is a keynote that very very seldom you may find. But if you find it's a good keynote.

155
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,821
After sneezing, trembling.

156
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:12,841
I had a very difficult case of chronic cough where finally they told me, the cough is ending to a sneeze.

157
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:28,921
I said, Oh God for 3 years I have been given half of the Materia Medica without effect. For God shake why don't you say so?

158
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:56,391
Cough day and night, mostly in the day time but the coughing so strong and after eating. Finally she gave me this.

159
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:02,311
I don't know if this symptom developed after all these remedies I gave or it was from the beginning.

160
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:20,931
But when she told me, I said very good, the remedy is Agaricus. Who said Agaricus? Very good.

161
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:39,211
We have not said this. In Agaricus we talked last September. Was this keynote there? No.

162
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:57,711
You see you don't find it, you find it very seldom but it is really a good keynote to remember.

163
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:07,000
Like this, if you can remember trembling on sneezing.

164
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:28,961
Agaricus has in the end of coughing, they have a spell of coughing. In the end there is sneezing and it's finished.

165
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:47,551
Or they eat and as soon as they finish eating, the cough starts. Both these are keynotes for Agaricus.

166
00:38:51,080 --> 00:39:00,561
Unless you have this little thing, never mind how much careful you take the case, you don't get these little keynotes

167
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:03,541
 forget it, you cannot find the remedy.

168
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:19,501
I've given Kali -c., Kali-p., Kali-bi., Nit-ac., this, that, Puls., God knows what I've given, no effect.

169
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,480
Canth. is a good remedy to wake us up.

170
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:57,031
 It's a very intense remedy, a remedy which produces intense inflammation. Very intense inflammation.

171
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:14,201
 If this child was a Canth. case within 24 hours you feel it's going to die, the inflammation is very strong.

172
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:19,791
And mostly the inflammation concerns the genito-urinary system.

173
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:30,801
They prefer to be inflamed in this part, I don't know why. The interesting thing with these remedies

174
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:37,391
they are preferring to affect certain parts of the human body.

175
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:50,751
Canth. prefers the genito-urinary and the moment the inflammation starts, almost immediately you see blood.

176
00:40:52,610 --> 00:41:00,671
Can you imagine an inflammation that takes place and in a few hours you have blood running because of the inflammation?

177
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:11,631
Can you imagine what strong burning pain they will experience these people? They will go to urinate and they will shout.

178
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:21,751
When you examine a case like this, of cystitis, you say 'is it a burning pain?'. 'Oh, very strong!'.

179
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:35,631
 'Do you shout when you urinate?', 'No'. This most probably is not a case of Canth.

180
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:55,001
I remember a case a mother had the children. She would cry and the children would get upset and she was trying

181
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:58,221
to hold herself not to shout.

182
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:13,261
A lot of power not to shout, so the pain is such that you shout. This becomes characteristic of the case.

183
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:33,681
And a better even confirmation is that in spite of the pains, in spite of the severity of the situation, there is desire for sex.

184
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:44,601
The desire for sexual contact is tremendous, like Platina.

185
00:42:48,920 --> 00:43:02,320
The men will have such desire that the erection during the night will be painful. They wish it could stop.

186
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:15,200
-May I ask something just for clarification. The pain before urinating and then it says and/or and then what is missing?

187
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:19,351
Does it also mean during and after urination?

188
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,851
-During urination is the main problem.

189
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:34,911
And after sure because it's inflamed. The urine passes and burns it. So during the urination, before, after the urination

190
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:48,631
but mainly during and after urination you have it. You can imagine, the urethra is inflamed. If you could open the urethra

191
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:56,221
 it oozes blood from the inflammation and at the same time there is desire to have sex.

192
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:05,431
And if they do have sex, of course if men have sex, it's tremendous the pain they have during ejaculation

193
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:22,271
 still the desire is there. So you can see how Canth. rises the sexual instinct and causes this kind of inflammation.

194
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:40,461
But whatever is the inflammation, if it takes that intensity, any inflammation, and at the same time you have an excitation

195
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:54,411
 of the genitalia, the sexual instinct then most probably is a case of Canth.

196
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:09,801
The idea is not to stick to words. The idea is to get the idea, the idea of the remedy, the idea of the intense inflammation

197
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:30,811
which is so fast that blood will come out. It can be a colitis. You see in cases where you will have a food poisoning

198
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:43,132
and within a few hours pains will start and diarrhea will start and then a few hours later you have diarrhea with blood.

199
00:45:48,120 --> 00:46:01,551
And then the patient is going fast to the next world, that's the case for Canth.

200
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:21,731
Theses cases actually you will see in the hospital mostly. There are cases that soon they go to hospital

201
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:27,241
because of the intensity of the progression of the case.

202
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:37,751
Strong sexual desire should be written with very much bigger letters.

203
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:52,311
And then we have some fears which look like fears of Stramonium.

204
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:09,091
And of course fear of water we have it also in Lyssinum or Hydrophobinum. Fear of water.

205
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:17,751
But fear of mirrors and shining objects, this combination is with Stramonium.

206
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:30,321
Lyssinum of Hydrophobinum is the same, not two different remedies.

207
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:34,631
You call it either Hydrophobinum or Lyssinum.

208
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:54,511
And of course this remedy now, in which case you may be use it, another possibility?

209
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:04,521
Where do you feel this sudden burning, unbearable pain?

210
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:25,081
When you burn yourself with fire. You burn yourself with fire and then the patient is going crazy with the pain, the burning

211
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:38,720
and he is fast going away to the next world, Canth. is really amazing what it can do.

212
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:55,651
I don't have the experience of hospital cases of second degree burns in which we could have been using it.

213
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:03,239
But between first and second degree where you have this really burning and you don't have people hospitalized

214
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:10,270
and you have given Canth., always Canth. has ameliorated the pain.

215
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:25,010
So the idea is the fire. Fire to the genito-urinary system, fire, excitement.

216
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:44,251
It's not excitement which is feelings, it's instinct. Sexual instinct is roused.

217
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,221
-What about burns from chemical?

218
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:08,461
-Burns from chemical, if they have this type of pain and this intensity, sure, anything.

219
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:26,361
Use Canth. in burns and you will see your experience. Not in little burns. Maybe other remedies.

220
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:40,081
Pains are burning and raw. It's a combination of burning and the skin is raw, that means

221
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,031
you don't have a skin anymore; it's finished the skin.

222
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:49,641
The mucus membrane is finished; it's eaten up by the inflammation.

223
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,320
You don't have to know more.

224
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:12,781
-If you have cystitis and this burning pain but it is at the very beginning. But it is not that strong like you describe it, can you  think?

225
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:27,481
-Usually you will not think of Canth. If it starts with a little bit of pain, no Canth. You have to use other remedies.

226
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:35,801
If you use the wrong remedies and the inflammation becomes really bad, you may reach the point of Canth.

227
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:06,441
-I had a case in my clinic just a short while ago. It was a motorcycle driver who had an accident

228
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:21,671
not much happened but 3 days later he had a constant erection.

229
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:38,861
And he had seen other Homeopaths before and he had received Op., Rhus-t. and Arn. and did not go away.

230
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:48,340
And then he went to the hospital because the swelling glands were deteriorating,

231
00:52:56,510 --> 00:53:02,420
and they suggested to operate on him but he didn't want that and that's how he came to my office.

232
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:08,440
 This was the only symptom I had, this constant priapism.

233
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:22,871
And I asked him whether he had any complains during urination and he said 'yes due to the priapism, I have a lot of pain'.

234
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:40,431
And so these were the only symptoms I had and due to this extreme pain I gave him Canth., high potency

235
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,520
and after 2 days, the erection was gone.

236
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:58,751
That's why I wanted to ask again because what I know of Canth. is that  they have infections over the genital urinary system

237
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,601
with priapism, that is my knowledge.

238
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:16,801
-Not necessarily. They have desire for sex, they have erection, strong erection, painful and they say God help me.

239
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:28,201
This type is another type which can happen. It doesn't necessarily need the inflammation of the cyst

240
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:38,635
or the urethra but it is very good in this case, you did very well you gave Canth.

241
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,991
-My impression also was that in the beginning he didn't really mind this constant erection. He seemed to enjoy it.

242
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,091
Only after 3 days it started feeling suspicious for him.

243
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:03,911
-That is true and I will give you some dangerous information now.

244
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:15,661
-I wanted to ask if this remedy is also good for very strong sun burn? Feeling like very much heat.

245
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:31,041
-Yes if the sun burn is really strong and burning the whole body, Canth. most probably will do it.

246
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:44,291
It's interesting also to observe that in such cases they have sun burn, at the same time the sexual instinct is roused.

247
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:52,951
I mean how this happens, nobody knows but in the sun burn, they are sitting under, it's burning and at the same time

248
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:00,231
there is strong sexual desire. That is definitely a case of Canth.

249
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:06,357
-Which potency would you suggest in such strong case of sunburn?

250
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,860
-200, 1M around that area.

251
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:25,191
-Perversions.
-All kinds of perversions.

252
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:33,851
When there is such sexual excitement, I don't like to go and describe perversions and things like that

253
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:49,471
because then it becomes like kinky lessons. But all the remedies which they have strong sexual excitement

254
00:56:49,520 --> 00:57:01,111
 they can have sexual perversions of all different types. I don't know them neither I ask the patients.

255
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:13,641
You don't need this. You don't need to know what kind of perversion somebody is doing but if you see a Canth. case

256
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:27,141
you know it can do anything. Or a Plat. case or a Tarent. man, or Nux-v.

257
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:33,360
Nux-v. is famous for perversions.

258
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:50,161
But with Canth. I will tell you because you may get this sometimes.

259
00:57:50,210 --> 00:58:00,401
You get a woman who did not have sex for a period of time, 3 years, 4, 5 years.

260
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:13,970
And then she falls in love with somebody. Passionate and she has very passionate love and enjoys that.

261
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:29,124
This woman has a possibility that will develop without any reason symptoms of Canth. with severe cystitis or urethritis.

262
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:48,011
That means the passion which arises the sexual energy to that level, then it causes inflammation. It's very strange.

263
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:58,041
I have examined these cases. 'Did you have an infection, your husband had an infection?', 'No, no,no'.

264
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:10,080
'Your boyfriend?'. 'No'. Just out the passion that she developed this kind of cystitis we are talking about.

265
00:59:12,363 --> 00:59:20,271
-Because I've seen a case of Canth., he was obsessed when he was 17, somebody told him that he stinks

266
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:28,971
and since then, now he is 37, three quarters of the day hides in toilet, putting toilet paper in his genitalia

267
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:33,451
busy with his stool all day long.

268
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:38,281
-That most probably is a case of Hyos.

269
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:44,211
-Yes but he had a lot of other things which was Canth.

270
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:55,901
-The Canth. has to have the intensity; it's like an inflammation that takes you to death.

271
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:06,840
 A woman gives everything she has, all the passion. Like leading herself to death.

272
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:20,811
-Is  it possible the other way around? For example, a woman has a very strong desire for sex usually

273
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:32,551
and now she started have sex and after that, 6 hours after, she had twice a cystitis.

274
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:37,596
She called me at 6 o'clock in the morning and said, it's really burning, she was nearly crying.

275
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:43,581
-Yes it is. That's the case. That's a case of Canth. exactly.

276
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:55,161
-Staphysagria?
-Staphysagria maybe but the first remedy you are thinking once you see this...

277
01:00:56,380 --> 01:01:20,111
Also this can happen in new married women, if especially they are chaste. If they are chaste, that means they don't practice sex.

278
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:36,871
They go to marriage and they let themselves loose and they enjoy very much and a few days later

279
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:42,371
they come down with severe cystitis. This is a case for Canth.

280
01:01:51,080 --> 01:02:04,171
Once you get the idea, the moment that you will hear the story, the information will come and you will prescribe.

281
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:19,901
-What about cases of a chronic cystitis which cease but after sexual intercourse keep reoccurring.

282
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:23,071
Would that also be a case of Canth.?

283
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:46,121
-No, unless they have that intensity but just simple cases of cystitis, no. Other remedies you have to think of, Med. in this case.

284
01:02:47,100 --> 01:03:05,391
The intensity is important, the erection has to be painful, I'm suffering save me. It has to have the intensity.

285
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:45,151
That is a remedy that really is slow to perceive sensations, feelings, very slow and cannot accommodate external impressions.

286
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:57,800
It's too much for Cocc. It gets tired, exhausted especially after loss of sleep.

287
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:13,671
They lose sleep 1,2,3 10 days, 15 days no sleep and then it comes a state of anxiety

288
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:23,031
and at the same time slowness to adapt to external impressions.

289
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:41,681
What do we mean by that? Cocc. cannot travel. She says, 'I cannot travel anymore with the car, especially if I'm sitting on the front seat'.

290
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:55,761
Because the impressions as they pass with the car cannot be absorbed, cannot be accommodated.

291
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:13,231
And there is the tendency to vomit and tendency to vertigo and nausea. Vertigo and vomiting and nausea on accommodating motions.

292
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:24,751
It is one of the main remedies we use, wrongly for me, for sea sickness. When you came with the speed boat

293
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:34,671
and some of the people could not accommodate that motion; Cocc. will tell you 'it's not possible for me

294
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:44,011
to go on a boat because of the motion. When I go into the car, I have to close my eyes or to hold my head

295
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:53,871
not to have this side pictures'. As the car goes by, the side pictures are those that bother mostly.

296
01:05:53,920 --> 01:06:03,621
They have to look in front and it seems that the whole nervous system comes to a stand still, into a slowness.

297
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:12,288
And then that nervous system does not transmit or transmit very slowly the impressions.

298
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:23,351
So you pinch somebody and it says 'oh!', after a few seconds.

299
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:38,991
The signal from the foot to the brain takes a few seconds. It's the same thing with optic signals.

300
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:53,591
They cannot accommodate it, then there is vertigo. These people are exhausted, unable to think

301
01:06:53,640 --> 01:07:08,849
the mind becomes very slow and they develop an anxiety about their own health but also an anxiety about others.

302
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:16,591
So in this respect they will look like Phosphorus very much.

303
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:27,031
Anxiety for themselves, anxiety for others. 'My mother is sick, I don't know what to do but I have this dizziness

304
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:36,080
all the time in my head and I can't travel, I can't go into the boat'. And then this slowness.

305
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:12,391
And slow, slow, slow, what happens in the end if the nervous system becomes very slow, more slow, they are paralyzed.

306
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:28,261
So we have paralysis which usually does not have any sign of pain. No pain. Paralysis with no signs of pain.

307
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:48,801
Weakness of neck muscles, heaviness, the head falls down.

308
01:08:51,560 --> 01:09:07,811
These are slow developing cases of M.S. We have some type of M.S. which is a progressive paralysis.

309
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:17,671
Usually it is diagnosed as M.S. but it is not the typical M.S. It's a paralysis which goes slowly  and becomes

310
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:25,910
worse and worse, year after year.
So it is a degeneration of the nervous system.

311
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:38,831
 This is a case of Cocc. Especially if this paralytic state is accompanied by vertigo, by dizziness.

312
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:49,411
And even better if the whole thing has started after long periods of sleeplessness.

313
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:20,371
-I wish to ask you about Cocc. and M.S. because I have a patient with M.S.

314
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:31,331
He is 15 years and I gave her Cocc. but I was really not satisfied because she had no vertigo.

315
01:10:34,010 --> 01:10:39,181
-15 years of M.S. or the patient is 15 years old?

316
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:56,583
-She is 40 years old with 15 years of M.S. and first of all I gave Causticum because I was really disturbed she had no vertigo.

317
01:10:56,730 --> 01:11:07,511
And what do you mean about this? I thought that Cocc. must have vertigo in these kind of problems.

318
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:22,811
-When there is vertigo and this slowness of reaction to receive the signals, then it is a Cocc. case.

319
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:32,471
Most probably maybe it is a case of Plumb., of Cupr. whatever, especially if there are any pains, any cramps.

320
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,840
Periodicity also, this does not show.

321
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:46,791
-In sea sickness how do you differentiate Tab. from Cocc.?

322
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:15,761
- Cocc. will not vomit. It will have the nausea. Tab. will be much stronger. In Tab. we see immediately

323
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:21,861
 the person becomes white, tremendous nausea and vomits.

324
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:32,141
So the intensity is different but for the sea sickness, I mean for the time the person has sea sickness

325
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:53,631
to tell him take Tab. as a preventive before you go instead of taking Dramamine, take Tab. or Cocc..

326
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:59,440
forget it, it will not act. It will not act.

327
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:10,031
-But George in low potencies I have the experience that children for example, they take the remedy and acts good.

328
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:20,711
They get sick when they go to the car and if you give Cocc. D6 before they enter the car, I have a few children and it helps.

329
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:27,441
-Before they enter the car?
-When they start, the Cocc. is in the car.

330
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:31,601
-No in my experience.
-Maybe it's placebo effect.

331
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:43,251
-But if the boys cannot travel really, they have a problem maybe Cocc. is their constitutional remedy.

332
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:56,111
You can give it in high potency and they can be cured. But to give it as a preventive and next time give it again, this I doubt.

333
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:03,151
Of course if you are giving low potency, it's like you are repeating a low potency and maybe one day you find out

334
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:10,571
 they don't have it anymore. They are cured because Cocc. was indicated as a remedy for example.

335
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:13,801
-You can't give it as prevention?

336
01:14:13,850 --> 01:14:17,151
-You cannot. I said, you cannot give it.

337
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:25,681
-But dentists have the problem that our patients in certain treatment, they always have the problem of vomiting.

338
01:14:25,730 --> 01:14:40,061
For instance taking braces or by taking X-rays and we have to help them. And I found out

339
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:49,831
that you touch them like this this helps more than any homeopathic remedy. I forget the name

340
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:57,151
you touch here 3 times and you tell them now you are very quiet and this will help.

341
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:03,251
-If you hypnotize them !

342
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:14,081
-But it's very important because they are very afraid just before.

343
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:32,201
I have been very nice myself many times when I am in despair, I say calm down please, nothing helps.

344
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:43,951
-You can say I can give any Ipecacuanha sometimes?

345
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:51,121
-If they vomit very easily? If you give them Ipecacuanha you cure them from their problem with their colitis.

346
01:15:54,990 --> 01:16:08,121
-I have a very peculiar case. There is somebody who immediately falls asleep if he is reading 3-5 minutes

347
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:20,591
although he has slept already. And I couldn't help him with the Colch. or with the Nat-m. What would you suggest?

348
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:28,921
-I would suggest Opium or Nux-m.

349
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:36,350
Sensation of hollowness or emptiness in the head, chest or abdomen is the same as.....

350
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:52,320
Phosphorus!

351
01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:04,750
So you have to combine immediately the information, one with the other, so you don't stick your mind to one remedy.
