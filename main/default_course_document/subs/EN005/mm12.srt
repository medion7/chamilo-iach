1
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:42,142
I just give you some small remedies to show you the idea of what we say, essentials.

2
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,290
What are the essentials of Ac-ac.?

3
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:16,650
Ac-ac. is vinegar. Do you know why they used vinegar in old times? I remember when I was young I was hearing

4
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:30,430
that women who were fat, they were advising each other to drink vinegar. 'Drink so much vinegar'.

5
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:44,999
They were some accidents of course from drinking vinegar and the accidents were that people lost weight

6
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,760
and they became anemic.

7
00:01:51,790 --> 00:02:20,819
So Ac-ac., we see here that we have a few black things. It says severe gastritis, stomach as if full with vinegar.

8
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:31,659
This is an expression that you may hear with people who are skinny, who are pale, who are anemic

9
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:44,799
and have stomach problems. You can imagine, skinny, white, stomach problems and intense thirst.

10
00:02:48,200 --> 00:03:01,310
There is one strong keynote which says impossible to lie on back.

11
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:16,120
As soon as they lie on back, they start having problems with their stomach, acidity, a sense of fullness, dysphoria.

12
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,859
So they have to turn immediately left or right.

13
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:33,590
It is one of the very few remedies that cannot lie at all on their back. So you have a gastritis, cannot lie on back, Ac-ac.

14
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:51,020
And you have this picture of white, pale, anemic individuals. It says anguish and anxiety, this is general symptom.

15
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:58,909
Anguish, anxiety, people who really look sour.

16
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:19,379
When the stomach is affected chronically, people get a particular psychology, which is a sour psychology.

17
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:34,720
You say, 'I don't feel well today, my stomach'. You do a particular grimace in your face.

18
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:41,730
This is the type of the person that you will see with Ac-ac.

19
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:56,859
In the gastritis we have emaciation of course, intense thirst for large quantity.

20
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:05,390
Intense thirst, you will confuse this with what remedy?

21
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:26,759
With Phos. first, not so much with Bry. but with Ars.. Because it will pale, skinny and anemic and anxiety, anguish.

22
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:41,869
There is another symptom that you will find in Ac-ac. You may have a high fever and then sweating and then

23
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:54,760
you wonder that they don't have any thirst. You see in chronic conditions the thirst is increased for large quantities.

24
00:05:54,781 --> 00:06:02,080
 In acute conditions, in fever there is sweating and no thirst, this is strange.

25
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:20,419
Worried about business affairs. What is another remedy who does this? Bry. and another one is Psor.

26
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,540
Calc-f also, very good.

27
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,170
Ambra not so much.

28
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:42,080
This is what you have to remember from Ac-ac.

29
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:59,059
Sour people, stomach problems, gastritis, intense thirst, anemia. Wasting, debility, weakness, so you have the picture.

30
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:14,069
This, you cannot say it is the essence of the remedy, it is some essential features of the remedy.

31
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:21,259
We don't have the full picture, mental-emotional picture of Ac-ac.

32
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,939
We have some essentials but these essentials should bring the mind to Ac-ac.

33
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:01,640
In All-c. you have to remember a few things.

34
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:21,579
Of course the one that everybody knows is that the nose is running watery acrid discharge, that makes red the nostrils.

35
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:34,689
The nostrils become red. There is lacrimation also. The lacrimation is not acrid; it's the opposite as the Euphrasia.

36
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,139
This everybody knows.

37
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,730
How do you recognize a chronic case of All-c.?

38
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:14,669
You will recognize by two things. One is a desire for onions. Excessive desire for onions.

39
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:36,809
And another thing which is not recorded in our books it is sleepiness, excessive sleepiness. Lethargy, lethargic.

40
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:49,379
And you will see in common colds towards the evening where the All-c. becomes worse, they become lethargic

41
00:09:49,400 --> 00:10:01,519
they want to lie down and you just want to sleep. The head is full, the headache is there, the nose is running

42
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:07,190
the coughing starts and you are lethargic, especially in the evening time.

43
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,440
This sleepiness and this lethargy can lead up to the point where we have a mental case.

44
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:29,799
And a mental case that will look like Opium, sleeping all the time.

45
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:43,539
I remember a case, the mother said I gave him some money to go and buy something.

46
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:54,739
And from the house to the shop, he lied down and slept. I went there in the shop, he had the money

47
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:05,109
 he couldn't remember what was to buy. He came back and he couldn't remember anything and when they brought the boy

48
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:11,790
 the boy was sitting there with his mother and as the mother was talking, the boy was sleeping.

49
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:25,419
And a total indifference about the surrounding. Whether you are there or not it doesn't matter.

50
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:33,139
He takes out his penis and urinates, oblivious of the surrounding.

51
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:42,829
The mother said, we were on the train and he wanted to urinate, he urinated in the train in front of everybody.

52
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:53,600
I'm talking about a boy of 14 years old; it's not a small boy of 2 years old.

53
00:11:53,621 --> 00:12:05,609
But this shows the tendency of the remedy on the indifference, on the non perception of the surroundings.

54
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,729
He is oblivious of the surroundings.

55
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:22,099
No signs of catarrh. Nothing. In these chronic cases you will not have.

56
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:38,529
One thing you have to remember that All-c. goes fast from the upper respiratory track down and starts

57
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:49,939
with pharyngitis, laryngitis and then bronchitis. And it can go very fast and in case that you are giving wrongly,

58
00:12:49,960 --> 00:13:06,200
in a case of coryza you prescribe wrongly All-c., you will speed up the laryngitis or the pharyngitis and the coughing will start.

59
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:21,899
Also it is a remedy that you have to be careful in people who have sensitivity with their bronchial system.

60
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:29,099
That you don't give it easily because you will cause dyspnea. It will cause dyspnea very soon.

61
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:39,930
The cold goes down and people are sensitive and they start having dyspnea. That means the remedy was wrong.

62
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:55,739
Is pressed downwards, this is very important. Also All-c. is worse with heat, worse in the evening.

63
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:02,969
So you will confuse it with what remedy?

64
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:13,019
It's going to be confused with Pulsatilla because the moment the heat is there, the fever rises.

65
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:29,779
If you have a room which is very warm, the fever and the dysphoria arises; so they need to open quickly the window

66
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:40,560
to get fresh air and in the meantime they get fresh air, they are chilled. But heat makes them very much worse.

67
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:49,149
So therefore it looks like Pulsatilla. What is the difference?

68
00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:05,409
The coryza with Pulsatilla is blunt. That means you will see no redness around this area.

69
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:15,239
With All-c. in 95% cases you will see redness around this area.

70
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:23,670
Which is another remedy which has this redness around this area in coryza?

71
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:38,949
Arsenicum. What is the difference? Ars. will need heat, All-c. will be worse from heat.

72
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:50,360
If you have a coryza that will start on the left side and go to the right side, the nose running on the left side

73
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:05,739
1 day, 2 days, then right side. Then this can be All-c.  What other remedy can be?

74
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,089
 A remedy which is worse in heat and goes from left to right?

75
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,160
Lachesis.

76
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:26,429
Onions which is very strong, better in open air, hoarseness.

77
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:51,419
It's painful hoarseness. You do like this and you feel as if the throat is split.

78
00:16:52,800 --> 00:17:03,279
All these remedies that we have talked, we have talked on the essential features.

79
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:14,579
We did not talk about the essence of the remedy, a little bit on All-c., a little bit we talked about it.

80
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:37,539
- I had a case of lumbago and I gave Bry. and this person had a sensitivity in the lungs. She had chronic asthma but not often.

81
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:52,539
And she got a severe asthmatic condition after Bry. for lumbago. Did you ever observe this for Bryonia?

82
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:07,579
- Most probably during the time of the lumbago he must have had some respiratory infection and the infection

83
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,840
 went down, most probably.

84
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:17,089
-She did not have.
-Well it's very strange.

85
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:35,389
Most probably she had but she had no apparent symptoms because since she was sensitive in her lungs

86
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:48,179
 I believe that Bry. was suppressing in this caseand brought the respiration down. How long it lasted?

87
00:18:51,310 --> 00:19:07,019
-It was very severe, it lasted for several hours and was not functioning. She had to get cortisone.

88
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:30,499
-This is the same with All-c., in case there is an inflammation here and you give All-c. you may have this problem.

89
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:40,059
I cannot explain this if you take it as a proving...

90
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:50,149
-What's the pathology this sleepiness about All-c. is something very new that the texts don't say it.

91
00:19:50,170 --> 00:20:05,249
I have a case of a 42 years old man who has chronic sinusitis for 20 years.

92
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:24,939
He has a sleepiness to the extent that I have to go out to the waiting room, call him that your appointment is here

93
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:33,539
and come into the chamber. He even sleeps if you have a little pause while you are talking to him. I gave him Opium

94
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:44,219
 because his airways are so full of enlarged mucus back here and in the nose also.  Where is the pathology in All-c.

95
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:54,149
I understand about Op. but how does All-c. gets to this state of sleepiness? Is it the sleep apnea as we explained in Op.?

96
00:20:54,170 --> 00:21:02,939
-I don't know. What I know is that if you eat a lot of onions in the night and you have sleeplessness, you are going to sleep.

97
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:13,299
Garlic and onions, especially onions will make you sleep.

98
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:47,459
Actually it relaxes most probably the vascular system because both onions and garlic bring down the blood pressure.

99
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:57,889
And because of that relaxation, the stimulation which is there on the brain, becomes less most probably.

100
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:03,240
I don't know the physiology, it's very difficult.

101
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:15,749
In this case you can try because it is exactly the case that we are talking, the sinuses are affected

102
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:26,699
and this tremendous sleeplessness. Try high potency 1M, 10M and write back to me.

103
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,160
We know a little bit more about Ambra grisea.

104
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:19,579
It's very interesting I talk sometimes as if the remedy is female and some other times as if it is male.

105
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:28,709
Which means actually in practice more times it's prescribed for females than males.

106
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:37,469
Sulphur is prescribed more for males, Lycopodium for males.

107
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:55,949
Anyhow the Ambra is more a female remedy. It's a remedy which has a very strange psychology.

108
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:05,890
She is very timid, very inhibited.

109
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:19,419
How do we know that? Because she feels that the natural functions of having stool or having urination

110
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:33,839
 for her it is something which is very secret and she cannot relax if she knows that somebody is next door

111
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:43,589
and is hearing what is doing in the toilet. This is very characteristic and goes to extreme.

112
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:57,279
What you will get initially, you will get a very nice lady who will be very nice, very talkative.

113
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:10,249
She will respond to your questions quite easily and she will admit that she is very very timid.

114
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:20,979
But the timidity is especially concerning the action of defecation and urination.

115
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:39,219
The mind becomes weak and does not follow a conversation. When you are in company, you discuss with somebody

116
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:48,329
you hear what he says, you respond, things like that. When Ambr. is in company, cannot respond.

117
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,899
Either she will keep quiet, totally quite not understanding what's going on in the conversation

118
00:25:55,030 --> 00:26:01,429
or she will keep on asking questions, irrelevant questions.

119
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,079
In a conversation you hear and then you respond.

120
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:18,370
Ambr. gets so excited, she talks and asks again and again and you say, what is she doing?

121
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:41,320
 It is a beginning state of Alzheimer's. It is a beginning state of arteriosclerosis.

122
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:56,039
In sexuality also she is inhibited; she cannot relax and enjoy the sexual act.

123
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:08,629
They have to have a lot, to go on with long relationship before they can relax and can feel at ease.

124
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,339
It's a dreamy state of mind and forgetfulness. She asks questions, not waiting for answers, jumping

125
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:30,329
from one subject to another. You see these are expressions that you cannot otherwise say.

126
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:37,539
In the Repertory you have to give an expression but you have to understand the psychology.

127
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:49,979
A weak mind, does not understand what is going on, gets excited very much. At the same time being inhibited

128
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:04,969
and timid and how this person will behave. They will say nonsense. They will ask questions which are not relevant.

129
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:16,019
Loss of confidence. But you understand now the difference between loss of confidence in Ambr. and loss of confidence

130
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:22,190
in Bar-c. of loss of confidence for Anac.

131
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:46,779
Disgust in seeing others laughing. These are expressions of a prover, actually what happens is that she is not in communication.

132
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:55,959
Difficult to communicate, to be in touch. So if you are not in touch and somebody is laughing and I don't know why

133
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:03,570
he is laughing, then I'm disturbed. This is the idea. You got the idea?

134
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:24,989
Prematurely old. Why prematurely old? Because all this behavior is not the behavior of a person of 50, 60 years old.

135
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:30,880
It's the behavior of somebody who is losing the power of the mind.

136
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:39,779
Easily embarrassed of course and it says symptoms are aggravated in the presence of others.

137
00:29:41,740 --> 00:30:04,699
This is not in general but mostly the presence of others is concerning functions of sex and urinary and functions of defecation.

138
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:16,179
Tries to please everyone, cannot say no. This is a symptom, have we spoken about Cancerinum? No.

139
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:27,909
You see Carc. has that also and this remedy has the same thing.

140
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:37,479
But this comes from the weakness of the will and weakness of the mind. In Cancerinum comes from other reasons.

141
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:46,059
- Compare Lach. and Ambr. on jumping from one subject to another. Lach. would be, you ask the question

142
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,779
and then next half an hour, an hour you are free. In Ambra that would be just confused answer?

143
00:30:54,230 --> 00:31:13,369
- In Lach. you have somebody who jumps from one subject to the other. But in Lach. is a kind of loquacity.

144
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:26,469
That means she cannot stop. Now this lady gets excited in a certain moment, in a company, you go out and she listens

145
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:31,879
 she gets excited and she puts some irrelevant questions to you.

146
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:51,939
Did you have tea? Oh yes, you had tea. And she answers herself. It is a state where she does not know what she is doing.

147
00:31:51,960 --> 00:32:07,339
Lach. is totally different. She will start telling story. You say, 'what is your problem?' and she says

148
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:17,000
'shall I tell you the whole story?'. If you say yes, you had it.

149
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:26,069
She will stop by the end of the interview, one hour. Your time is over, she will stop.

150
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:37,339
But not saying exactly to the point where you asked, but bringing into the picture any associate pictures

151
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,490
 that come to her mind.

152
00:32:45,800 --> 00:33:03,279
This is different. You have to enter the psychology of the person. The weakness of the mind, you have to feel the remedy.

153
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:14,499
To be able to differentiate between one and the other. Otherwise flat symptoms will point out to something similar.

154
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:24,519
Eventually all the remedies will look similar. One remedy is all the symptoms, the other remedy has the same symptoms.

155
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,509
The other remedy has all the other.

156
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:37,699
Especially with some teachers adding information and information will make all the remedies look alike.

157
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,569
There is nothing in one remedy that separates from another.

158
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:56,779
Here what we need is to find the individuality. If I want to describe her, him, I have to give characteristics.

159
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:08,749
I cannot say they have two eyes, one nose etc. Everybody has two eyes, unless somebody is blind, you say one eye.

160
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,939
But you have to give the characteristics; so you look to this person you have to find the characteristics.

161
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:29,139
What are her characteristics? You look at him, you say the characteristics, the shape of the face, shaved, tall.

162
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:37,609
 She, with different hair and glasses. You give two characteristics. And you go to the class and say

163
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:48,219
 somebody with reddish hair and some glasses and intense look.

164
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,779
This is the idea with Homeopathy.

165
00:34:52,800 --> 00:35:05,029
This is what I try, to pass the information to you so you can differentiate the one individual pathology

166
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:13,449
from another individual pathology. This is the whole idea with Homeopathy. Why is not Cham.

167
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:24,199
 why is not China and not Calc-p.? This is Ant-c. Why?

168
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:31,420
You know in the older times when I taught, students used to get mad.

169
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:47,929
But it does not have this! They look in the Repertory and the patient would have said, 'I have a pain in the big toe'

170
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:55,589
 between other symptoms. Then I would say  OK this is Pulsatilla case because it's typical.

171
00:35:55,610 --> 00:36:01,659
And somebody would get up, look in the Repertory, pain in the big toe, there is nothing.

172
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:10,629
No Pulsatilla has pain in the big toe. We had to get away from that strategy.

173
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:18,795
You may sometimes find all the symptoms, that is very good. But sometimes you have to go to essentials.

174
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:29,339
 So this lady may come with kidney problems, with gallbladder problems with respiratory problems

175
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:36,569
 with heart problems, it doesn't matter. You will not be able to come down to the remedy

176
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:44,120
unless you go to the essentials and you understand. You say, this is Ambra grisea.
