1
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:22,460
[...]

2
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,160
-For how long?

3
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:35,130
-3 months. Since last November very mildly and then it became worse.

4
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:42,040
I took some treatment when it was still mild and over the treatment it went worse and

5
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:47,380
worse; so I stopped that treatment and over the last 3 months I've tried other things.

6
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
-Chiropracticing.

7
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,360
-Yes the last 3 weeks I went to other people to do more gentle things and then

8
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,960
Homeopathy the last 3 months has been every week.

9
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:22,370
I've got to try something now. I tried a treatment for 3 weeks and after 3 weeks

10
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:30,210
I realized it's not working, not changing, so I'm very desperate. Sorry.

11
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,130
-I'll give you my first thoughts very quickly.

12
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:48,780
The history, as she relates, it suggests that might be a slip disc, in which case you might

13
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,140
have a serious condition.

14
00:02:51,630 --> 00:03:01,120
That means the sciatic nerve is pressed and it is a mechanical pressure.

15
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,280
This is what I'm thinking at the moment and the second thing I'm thinking, looking at her

16
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:22,280
in her body, I see there is a kind of flabbiness and I see also that the abdominal muscles

17
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,800
especially are not strong enough.

18
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:36,700
That means she is a girl who has not been doing exercises and she has a predisposition

19
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:45,880
for lumbago and with sciatica.

20
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,780
The other thing which I perceive is that she is suffering very much, that the pain is

21
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:08,030
constant and what I'm interested is to see whether there is any position in which

22
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,550
she is better and she can answer now.

23
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:35,200
-Usually when the pain is bad  sit on my hunches of my hands and knees.

24
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:43,780
It used to help but then owed to be sitting on the floor on my knees with my hands on

25
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,870
the back, that would help.

26
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:54,220
But now sitting like this the pain is a little bit better.

27
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:06,970
-You have sciatica on right side? Do you have a lumbago at the same time?

28
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,140
-I don't know.

29
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:18,200
-The first thing we want to understand is the pathology because pathology is

30
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,450
quite severe and we have to understand exactly what pathology and the modalities.

31
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:29,290
Therefore my questions will be concerning the pathology and the modalities.

32
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,450
The sciatica is starting from where? Can you put your hand?

33
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,890
-There and travels all the way down...

34
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:58,290
-This is right sciatica on the right side and which goes right to the foot, suggest as

35
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:08,220
primary, Lachesis. The right sciatica extending to the foot suggests Lachesis primarily

36
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:18,220
because of the pathology. I have this in mind and my next question will be what is the

37
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,940
position that ameliorates?

38
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:29,640
Is it by pressing, by warm, by cold, by lying in a position, by standing, by walking

39
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,660
by lying in a particular side?

40
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,200
-Lying on my left side is better and warm is better.

41
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,580
-Lying on the left side means when she lies on the painful side, she is much worse.

42
00:06:51,860 --> 00:07:01,220
I picked up the way she said much worse. The much worse is a symptom which I want

43
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,070
to take into consideration because she stressed that symptom.

44
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:16,640
During this time I want to know what remedies have been tried in this condition?

45
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,240
Could you enumerate the remedies that have been tried?

46
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:36,980
-First Colocynthis, then Sepia, Cantharis, then we tried 10M Thuja because it was a

47
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,730
constitutional remedy I had, 10M Lac Caninum because there was another remedy

48
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:50,890
I had before, then the homeopath finished, he said see somebody else.

49
00:07:50,990 --> 00:08:00,730
This homeopath gave me first Staphysagria, then Ignatia, then Pulsatilla, then last

50
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:07,080
week Carcinosin all in 30, not high.

51
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,410
They all helped me a little bit but nothing touched the pain.

52
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,490
-Other remedies?

53
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,810
-With my constitutional treatment Lac Caninum and Thuja.

54
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,390
-Are you afraid of snakes?

55
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:47,060
-This was 3 years ago. Hypericum and Arnica were taken; two nights ago I took

56
00:08:47,160 --> 00:09:06,650
Hypericum 200, 5 doses and it helped. And Ruta 30 this morning, 2 doses.

57
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:30,660
-All these underline 3 times. Underline is very important, how long you underline a case.

58
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:50,490
We don't have the symptom better lying in knee-elbow position, as she describes.

59
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,140
In the case we don't have a symptom, I have said many times, we can take a similar

60
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:05,890
symptom; that means worse or better in general lying on knee-elbow position.

61
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:20,230
So lying on knee-elbow position better, which is peculiar position in a case of sciatica

62
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,660
we have remedies like Medorrhinum and Kali carbonicum.

63
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:34,970
When she arrives at that point of information my main thinking is, is this a Kali carbonicum case,

64
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,630
a Medorrhinum or Lachesis case?

65
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:49,390
But we don't have enough information at this moment to prescribe any of these remedies.

66
00:10:52,630 --> 00:11:00,950
Crying while telling her symptoms now is not really a symptom because the pain is so

67
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:10,790
severe that she can cry. We can not really take it as crying during consultation because

68
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:16,640
it's almost inevitable symptom.

69
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:30,430
I want to differentiate between these remedies and we have also a symptom which is

70
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:37,280
worse lying on painful side.

71
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,760
There is a kind of restlessness, as you can see. She can not stand in one position.

72
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,610
Restlessness, she has to move all the time because of pain.

73
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:36,030
I am thinking what can be the best question that I can ask her.

74
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:48,180
I want to differentiate the Lachesis possibility. My question would have been in case

75
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:55,260
you have not heard all my thinking, the question would be how do you feel with tight

76
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,390
clothes around your neck, your waist, your breast?

77
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:11,730
-I don't like them around my waist. I don't wear them around my neck at all.

78
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:27,350
-Why?
-I don't like tight clothes.

79
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:39,220
-This now gives me a confirmation for Lachesis but in my mind knowing that she knows

80
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:50,240
Homeopathy, that's the first. The second is that she may be interested to have Lachesis.

81
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,840
I do not take this into consideration very much.

82
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:03,740
Therefore I'm going to ask other questions which are pertinent to Lachesis.

83
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:14,900
Then I go back to the original state, why this situation has arised on the first place?

84
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:25,550
So thinking the idea of Lachesis and thinking that maybe before this incident there was

85
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:32,490
a kind of incident between herself and her husband, boyfriend.

86
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:41,390
Whether there is a causative factor that will confirm Lachesis, for instance a jealousy

87
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:50,400
situation that has arised by last September of October, just before the incident took place.

88
00:14:51,150 --> 00:15:01,420
My question that you will hear asking is why she thinks this whole thing has started.

89
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,270
Most probably the answer will be I don't know.

90
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:10,420
-I know.
-Tell us.

91
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:20,570
-Because I left my partner last November, in the same month that the pain started.

92
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:31,470
It was not jealousy. I had to leave him.

93
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:40,570
-Whom you liked?
-By the time I left, I hated him.

94
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,570
-Because he had done something?
-A lots of things.

95
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:51,300
-Between these things that he had done, what it was? Can you describe a little bit?

96
00:15:51,400 --> 00:16:03,130
-He hits me and we argue and he was very dominant and he never listens to me and

97
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:11,300
I felt trapped; it took a long time for me to decide...

98
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,890
-But you have thought of leaving him a long time ago?

99
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,170
-Yes.

100
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:23,800
-And you were battling with this idea for several months?

101
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,350
-Yes a long time, a year.

102
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:37,230
-But what prevented you from leaving him much earlier, most probably was what?

103
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:44,870
-Just a feeling that it might be the wrong decision and my daughter and my father

104
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:54,590
I was worried for my family thinking I had failed. I was afraid as well of being on my own.

105
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,810
-This was your husband or your partner?
-Partner.

106
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:09,110
-So legally you are not bound to him but emotionally very much.

107
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:27,170
This is a case of Lachesis. I expect some extra passion was involved in this affair

108
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:34,690
and therefore I will ask her the question, what kind of a relationship was there?

109
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:43,760
Was a relationship of rather cool or it was real passionate things involved?

110
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:52,840
-Tempest. Very passionate and I felt deep in love when I met him. We have a child.

111
00:17:52,940 --> 00:18:01,700
I thought we were going to be together for ever but he changed.

112
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,000
-And he changed in such a way as to disappoint you mostly?

113
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:16,080
-Yes and it was unacceptable.
-His behavior towards you?

114
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:23,580
-Yes but I stayed and stayed thinking he will change.

115
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:33,120
-What was the first incident which you remember which made you decide this is not

116
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,870
good for me? Do you remember?

117
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,000
-Very well.

118
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:49,670
-Why I do these questions? I'm asking her in order to decipher whether under all this, but

119
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,170
I will tell you later on, I will let her talk first.

120
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:59,670
-The last decision I said, that's it. I'm leaving now, whatever happens I don't care.

121
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,830
The last time he hit me because there was no argument.

122
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:18,090
-I wanted the first time that made you think I have to leave or something like that

123
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:27,440
that was really bad, his behavior was really bad. Can you remember?

124
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:42,420
You will notice something else also in her, as she will bring out all the memories.

125
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,420
Now she has difficulty in bringing out the memory; that means there is something

126
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,090
there which she has hidden in her subconscious mind.

127
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:59,490
As she will bring this out, more and more, she will feel a little bit more comfortable in her sciatica.

128
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:15,720
As the sub-conscious anger, fear will bring out, she will be feeling better in her sciatica

129
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:24,420
and that is the reason why many times after the homeopathic consultation, we have the

130
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,050
patient saying, I'm feeling better.

131
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:33,470
It's never cured but it might be feeling better because he has brought out some

132
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:42,490
sub-conscious anger, fears, depressions etc, which were hidden very deep inside.

133
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:57,970
In this case I expect that the kind of sciatica has a deep root, that's why it keeps so

134
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:10,820
strongly and this root is mostly with the emotional level which is really hurt and really traumatized.

135
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:26,390
I insist that you will see how difficult it is for her and I observe that it is difficult, that

136
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:34,250
means it is deep. She has hidden the first incident that made her decide in her mind

137
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:39,070
almost sub-consciously that this is not a good relationship for me.

138
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:56,640
-There are so many. I can't remember the first time. I can't remember and...

139
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:04,990
I should have left a year ago but I can't remember the first time.

140
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:32,320
-By doing a repertorisation in this case and repertorising the symptoms, sciatica right side

141
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:58,060
combine the two. Leave out the general sciatica and put sciatica on the right side

142
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,810
because it is absolutely sciatica on the right side.

143
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:13,020
She does not complain about her left side at all.

144
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:44,330
Therefore we have sciatica lying on painful side, sensitive to clothing, abdomen,

145
00:23:44,430 --> 00:24:01,350
sacral region extending to feet, lower limbs extending to foot and then ailments from grief.

146
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:13,680
Give the analysis.

147
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:29,520
The analysis says too many symptoms with intensity 3, you can ask questions about

148
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:40,340
Lycopodium, Apis and Lachesis. Very good.

149
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:53,900
The repertorization points to the idea of Lycopodium as well and points to the idea of

150
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:02,200
Apis, except of the idea of Lachesis which we have been investigating.

151
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,920
Back to the question.

152
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:22,070
She says she can not remember. Because she insists that she can not remember

153
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:31,090
I want to put now a straight forward question that is connected with Lachesis.

154
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:38,670
This question will not be, are you jealous because most probably she will say, no.

155
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:49,570
My question to her will be whether this man looked or had flirt or something with

156
00:25:49,670 --> 00:26:00,670
another woman at another time, not lately. I'm talking about 2 years ago, 3 years ago

157
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,420
and what actually took place during that time?

158
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:28,320
-It was when we had seen each other, not long seen each other and he met a friend

159
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:37,330
of mine. It was a big flirt and she gave him a big kiss on the lips in the pub.

160
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,270
-In front of you?

161
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:50,110
-Yes and he was responded. I was furious and I could not talk and I wanted to leave.

162
00:26:50,210 --> 00:27:00,440
I just stood in the corner of the pub and he came over and said, sorry and he gave me

163
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:05,690
a big kiss and she came over and she said, I'm so sorry. You know how I am like.

164
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:21,960
You know me. I didn't like it, not at all. He never did that again.

165
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:35,620
-Now with her answer we may have the idea of jealousy again but I'm not satisfied

166
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:45,460
with the idea of jealousy and I'm going to pursue it further. I will then ask whether such

167
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:51,810
incidents later on took place and more serious than this incident.

168
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,220
-No.

169
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:07,890
-You did not feel that he was flirting with other women, neglecting you.

170
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:17,390
I used to think that he was neglecting me but I think I had a fear that he was.

171
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,970
-According to you he was faithful?
-Yes.

172
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,890
-You believe that?
-Yes, I believe he was faithful. I think he looked.

173
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:40,140
-He liked the idea of flirting but not actually doing.
-No.

174
00:28:53,390 --> 00:29:00,670
-I'm a bad investigator.
-He might wanted to.

175
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:11,620
-Now as I have lectured on Lachesis and I have said several times that Lachesis is not

176
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:20,290
always aware of her jealousy. Why? Because once she feels jealousy, then she is

177
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:28,290
closing inside, she will say I will never feel jealous again and then she presents another

178
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:34,390
picture where she becomes demanding.

179
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:52,290
You did not come on time, you left me there and this demanding on the part of the

180
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:57,870
woman who says, I'm not jealous, she will not accept she is jealous but the demands

181
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,140
are too much.

182
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:08,460
On the other hand, on the part of the man are received as excessive demands and

183
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:16,470
almost sometimes demands which are illogical.

184
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:39,170
Since we do not have this information from the man side we can only have information from her.

185
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:54,670
She seems to be quite prepared to talk openly and to talk the truth because she is

186
00:30:54,770 --> 00:31:00,220
suffering a lot and she needs desperately to be well soon.

187
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:11,950
Of course all this time if I was examining this case without talking my thoughts, you would

188
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:18,770
have heard some questions but some of them would look like irrelevant questions.

189
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:27,690
The idea is that I'm investigating still the idea of Lachesis.

190
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:34,440
I have not gone to the idea of Lycopodium, Medorrhinum.

191
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,690
-My pain is better.

192
00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:00,770
-Yes, you will be able now to talk a little bit more about these things and give us

193
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:10,010
information. You will have to analyze for us your character so I can understand.

194
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:14,880
The repertorisation of the computer gave me the idea of Lycopodium.

195
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:23,360
What I observe also is that she has the water here and drinks sips of water frequently.

196
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:33,010
Drinking frequently sips of water, one of the main remedies is Lycopodium, is not only

197
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,030
Arsenicum, you all know.

198
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:46,880
The repertorisation shows for me Lycopodium possibility, at the same time there is

199
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:54,430
a little symptom, which I observe, but maybe is because of anxiety that she is in front

200
00:32:54,530 --> 00:33:02,710
of the class; therefore I will ask whether the water she is drinking now, in the way she is

201
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:09,860
drinking is a habit of the last months or it is only today?

202
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:19,260
-No, it's drinking water all the time because my mouth gets very dry.

203
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:27,600
-Actually you don't want a lot of water, just sips?

204
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,700
-Yes, I have to have a pint of water next to my bed every night.

205
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:49,430
-Here we got a good symptom which is a general symptom of the organism which points

206
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:54,980
out to the idea of Bryonia or Lycopodium.

207
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:02,260
Since we have Lycopodium, this we enter into our repertorisation and see what happens.

208
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:15,230
Do you put thirst frequently for small quantities and then we see.

209
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,450
You saw the idea of Lachesis was coming up and you were elated but the moment I see

210
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:35,740
 the repertorisation, it points out to another possibility. I examine immediately the possibility

211
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:41,490
given the fact that I have seen a symptom of that remedy as well.

212
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:50,530
In my mind now there is Lachesis and Lycopodium and differentiation between

213
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:48,970
Lachesis and Lycopodium. How shall we differentiate?

214
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:06,000
I ask, can you describe your character in the idea she does not know what I'm asking.

215
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:13,730
She maybe describing a character which may be Lycopodium or a character which can

216
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,450
be Lachesis or she maybe describing another character all together.

217
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:31,840
Show the repertorisation. Again the same.

218
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:50,520
How would you describe your character? What are the main points in your character in

219
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:56,190
which you feel of course that there is some kind of pathology at this point?

220
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:04,430
I don't want to say, I'm a nice girl, I look after my children, I have a nice father who looks

221
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:12,570
after me, I like my family. All these are natural things which do not pertain to the idea

222
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:23,840
of pathology. We are asking to find what do you think that in your character are traits of pathology.

223
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:42,580
For instance, I'm very sloppy, I'm very egotistical, I'm very jealous, I'm crying, I'm demanding,

224
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:49,910
I'm manipulating others, I'm dictatorial. If I want something, I want this.

225
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:59,060
All these questions I'm putting now you would have heard without knowing what is in my

226
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:05,400
mind. But I've told you in my mind at this moment is the differentiation between

227
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:11,550
Lycopodium and Lachesis because Lycopodium also has the right side sciatica

228
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,400
and the other points which we have discussed.

229
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:28,800
-The best thing I can say is my sister, whom I live with now, she says that I am very

230
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:41,050
dismissive and I don't listen to her when she tries to tell me an idea or suggestion.

231
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:52,470
She said... her feelings because I didn't listen and I just swept over it and she said that

232
00:37:52,570 --> 00:38:08,200
I was very one-track-minded, that I'm only interested in what is good for me

233
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:13,380
and that I couldn't take onboard anything that she suggested.

234
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:36,450
That was surprised me but I feel like I like to be on my own when I'm feeling strong but

235
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:46,720
then when I'm in pain, I need people around me.
But when I'm OK...

236
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,720
-You are quite independent?

237
00:38:53,080 --> 00:39:04,050
-No, I think I'm quite needy with my partner that's why it was so hard for me to leave.

238
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:11,280
-Before I ask this question I have to explain to you why I put this question:

239
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:16,650
She said something important concerning the observation of her sister.

240
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:22,870
I want to know if that observation could be confirmed by the husband.

241
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,290
So I will ask what was the opinion of your husband?

242
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:35,720
-My husband said that I was always in control and that I was always got my own way.

243
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:44,870
-And I said, no you got your own way. But that's what he said.

244
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:50,120
We always said of each other the same.

245
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:55,300
He said I was in control and I said no he was in control.

246
00:39:55,570 --> 00:40:07,890
But he said it all the time that I was the one who got it my way but it didn't feel like I did.

247
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:20,410
-I see. I'm not prepared to jump into conclusions and for instance conclude that she is

248
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:33,000
quite authoritative or dictatorial and jump into the idea of Lycopodium or to the idea of

249
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,210
being egotistical.

250
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:46,830
She actually describes an egotistical state where I dismiss others, I want my own way.

251
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:54,740
This is the idea of egotism, maybe we have to analyze this in the class, later on.

252
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:03,340
I want the egotistical element to be in the Repertorisation.

253
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:25,920
Now at this point, she is quited down because the sub-conscious does not resist the pain.

254
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:44,570
At this point if I perceive her well, she is very concentrated in what I'm going to ask her

255
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:51,400
next and how she will deal with the next questions. But I will forget about this and I'll go

256
00:41:51,500 --> 00:42:04,570
to the father and ask the father what is his evaluation about the daughter.

257
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:13,500
Whether he can give us some information, an insight which can help us in the differentiation.

258
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,370
Can you show the Repertorisation?

259
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:46,150
We see here Lycopodium and Lachesis the two first remedies with the Lycopodium

260
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:51,590
being quite ahead of the list.

261
00:42:54,090 --> 00:43:11,340
Lycopodium, show me how many of her symptoms covers? 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 all of them.

262
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:20,260
So Lycopodium actually covers all the symptoms on which we have repertorised.

263
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,540
And Lachesis covers ...

264
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:59,490
So the father will try to describe. I will give you my observation concerning the father.

265
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:07,660
What I see from the father is that all along by the time that the daughter is relating her

266
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:17,530
case, he is in tears, he almost is very sympathetic, very much suffering at the same time.

267
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:48,660
Though being English and very phlegmatic and suppose not to show any emotions

268
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,580
he is crying and now he will stop to cry so to give me some information.

269
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,450
But the information he is going to give us, is not going to be very reliable.

270
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:05,830
This is my opinion at the moment, maybe I will be totally out but due to the very

271
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:12,050
sympathetic element towards the daughter, he can not be very objective.

272
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:21,600
Therefore, I'm asking but I'm not going to rely completely on what he is going to say.

273
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:27,010
After hearing all that he will try to be more objective.

274
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,050
Tell us.

275
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:35,430
-With pleasure. Little of the family background.

276
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:59,080
She and her twin brother was very, very pretty and she got very much attention.

277
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:09,160
Then when our daughter was born, when her sister was born, being a Taurus he was

278
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:16,010
very cuddly and I think without realizing I shifted a lot of my attention

279
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,740
onto the younger one not intending to neglect Sara.

280
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:31,320
I think that is something worth saying because what Sara has told me, when we talked about this,

281
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:41,510
when she had Lac caninum which helped tremendously, is that I was in my career becoming

282
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:48,860
famous and Anna was in the marketing job earning vast amount of money when was 18 and 19

283
00:46:50,200 --> 00:47:01,370
very successful and she thought I was nothing which we all said it's rubbish.

284
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:10,850
I think she is very, very strong and very, very good and I think she is going to be a good

285
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:20,100
homeopath but she doesn't believe it. So she gets very dependent and I always say

286
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,600
we should always try to get the best and be the best and Sara was always thinking that

287
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:31,230
she is not worth the best and settling with less than good.

288
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:42,640
She has always been a bit dependent and needing support emotionally and she is

289
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:48,140
very rewarding because she is a lovely person but she just tends not to appreciate

290
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:53,750
herself and that's my view.

291
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:12,610
-As I thought, the father tries to give a good idea about the daughter making in

292
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:22,610
any case a hint concerning jealousy from young age that jealousy may have arised

293
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:32,050
in young age, already by the birth of the second daughter. So we'll ask Sara whether

294
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:44,540
she remembers having jealousy feelings when you were a child.

295
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:54,890
-I don't know but me and my sister never got on.
-That means you fought together?

296
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,220
-Yes.

297
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:03,830
-You must have noticed, it does not escape my attention, the moment I mention this

298
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:08,770
matter she will almost start feeling the pain again.

299
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:22,520
She will feel a little bit discomfort. So the observation sometimes will be of a tremendous

300
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:32,690
importance in your analysis of the case but never jump into conclusions because still

301
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:34,790
the case is not solved.

302
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:41,940
If we jump into conclusion giving Lachesis or Lycopodium, we may be totally wrong.

303
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,920
We may be discovering something very important on the process.

304
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:55,380
What is definite there is the fact that her sciatica at the moment is connected with

305
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:02,880
some emotional stress which she has kept inside, she has suppressed it, gone to the

306
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:12,550
sub-conscious and then this inner torment expresses itself in the physical body with

307
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:14,900
this sciatica.

308
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:24,860
-I think also she is very giving and sometimes she is too generous and gives of herself

309
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,450
too much. So she is depleted, wanting to please, wanting to help others.

310
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:49,980
-I want to see if Lachesis has desire of drinking sips of water.

311
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:06,320
-What about the issue of money? We should be talk about that.

312
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:26,490
What Sara told me about her relationship was that he was draining in her resources

313
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:33,830
financially and she wanted to be much stronger and not have this strain because he

314
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:36,930
would contribute sufficient.

315
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:40,430
-Was he working?

316
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:50,490
-He did work but very erratic and the last summer he didn't have any work at all and

317
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:52,100
I was working hard.

318
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:57,190
-You had actually support him and the child.
-Yes and study.

319
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:01,900
-And at the same time he was biting you?
-Yes, so I left.

320
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:12,980
-It was too much.
-Yes, it was the last drop.

321
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:24,170
-But I noticed something else. As she relates that, I see her color becomes a little

322
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:39,530
bit red which shows actually to me that she is still connected emotionally with him.

323
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:47,460
That means she has not really decided in the very deep part of herself to leave him

324
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:56,430
finally and totally. There is still some connection and some battling and some conflict

325
00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:02,180
in her, whether this was the right decision or the wrong decision. Correct?

326
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:16,010
-Yes. My idea was that we would live apart and then perhaps that would make it easier

327
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:25,610
and we would change and I would change, we could perhaps look together again in a year.

328
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:43,350
I never wanted to say that it was totally over but since we have lived apart, I decided

329
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:47,190
that it has to be but it makes me sad.

330
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:57,090
-OK. Having reached that point I'm vacillating between Lachesis and Lycopodium.

331
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:05,390
I will put a question which is irrelevant to the mental-emotional state and which refers to

332
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:06,150
the general.

333
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:15,700
Lycopodium we know is much more sensitive to cold, whether Lachesis is more sensitive

334
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:26,900
to heat. We'll ask whether she is a warm person, where she can not tolerate heat or a

335
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:33,050
person who can not tolerate warm. What would you say?

336
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:43,530
Locally she has given already information that she is better heat, which is against

337
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:50,050
Lachesis and in favor Lycopodium but I ask in general.

338
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:59,000
-In general I have been feeling more chilly over the last months.

339
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,450
This winter in England has been very cold for me, more than normal.

340
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:18,720
-In bed your feet they both have the same temperature?

341
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,800
-I can't remember.

342
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,620
-This was a direct question of course for Lycopodium.

343
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,870
Lycopodium in bed feels the one foot can be warm, the other cold.

344
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:40,220
-With the sciatica this is always cold. This foot is cold and this foot is normal.

345
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,050
-You mean now with the sciatica, not before?

346
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,690
-Not before the sciatica.

347
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:54,820
-That means during the sciatica you noticed that there is a difference in temperature

348
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,440
between left and right.

349
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:04,950
-Yes definitely. One of the things I noticed is that this foot is cold.

350
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:17,100
-So the idea of Lycopodium again because of better heat and the difference in the cold

351
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,950
and heat of the feet, the idea of Lycopodium becomes even stronger.

352
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:29,100
Therefore my question in order to confirm Lycopodium, for the time being at least, will be

353
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:33,320
whether she is a person fond of sweets.

354
00:56:34,790 --> 00:56:47,040
-Yes. I have all the time. I just love chocolate and ice-cream and cakes.

355
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:48,570
-Now?

356
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:56,540
-Yes, with the sciatica. I say to my sister when you go to the shop, get me chocolate

357
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:09,310
cake please. Get me anything sweet. And more sugar in my tea gradually.

358
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:20,410
-This is a symptom for which I have said in the class before, by chance, that when we

359
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:26,960
come to the point do you like sweets and you get an answer like this, which actually

360
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:32,650
can confirm and can save your life and the life of the patient.

361
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:41,140
Because you can imagine what can happen if we give the wrong remedy.

362
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:50,040
But I'm a very cautious person and I would like to know the truth and only the truth and

363
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,730
if it's possible the whole truth.

364
00:57:52,730 --> 00:58:00,630
Therefore I want to understand what actually took place in this nice girl that we have

365
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:01,730
in front of us.

366
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:19,300
My idea now is that, is it possible perhaps that this is a case of Lachesis before

367
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:33,050
and then after has been beaten and decide to go away from this relationship, she has

368
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:35,400
gone into the state of Lycopodium?

369
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:45,500
If I understand it in this way, her problem, then I have a better chance of curing her

370
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:55,550
in depth; that means curing her sciatica and curing her predisposition to relapse and to

371
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:56,990
come back again and again.

372
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:09,550
I know also from our experience and from our books that Lachesis and Lycopodium are

373
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:12,770
complementary remedies.

374
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:27,550
So is it possible that the intolerance of clothing that points to Lachesis is a symptom that

375
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,800
we have to treat with the second remedy?

376
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:41,320
And is it possible that by giving Lycopodium some amelioration will take place and then

377
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:46,920
the Lachesis symptoms will become more prominent? How this will be?

378
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:54,840
It will be by reducing the desire for sweets and reducing the sensitivity to the cold.

379
00:59:56,340 --> 01:00:05,070
There is another question here, is it possible that after Lycopodium it might be an

380
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:11,070
exacerbation or the sciatica with a change in the warmth and then immediately after

381
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:17,650
2-3 days of Lycopodium we may have to give Lachesis, in case there are some changes?

382
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:24,010
These are thoughts which I have in my mind while I'm taking her case.

383
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:34,830
Of course for one old looker what will hear is desire sweets...

384
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:47,840
If you take the questions, only the questions, you will not see a sequence, a real logic

385
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,460
behind it.

386
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:06,830
I will ask now another characteristic symptom of Lycopodium which is how do you feel

387
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:16,430
waking in the morning? You feel refreshed from sleep, unrefreshed?

388
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:23,060
-Do you mean now? With the sciatica?
-Yes.

389
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:34,840
-It's worse in the morning when I wake because it's worse in staying still for a while.

390
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:40,340
Whenever I have a short sleep for a few hours, when I wake up I know it's gonna be

391
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:51,970
really painful. So I'm not sleeping very much. 3 hours.

392
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:56,090
-So you wake up in the morning and you feel very sleepy still and you want to go back to sleep?

393
01:01:56,190 --> 01:01:59,690
-Yes but I can't.

394
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:01,060
-Why you can't?

395
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:03,890
-Because of the pain in my leg.

396
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:18,330
-Now what she relates is the idea of suffering during sleep. So I go back to Lachesis and

397
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:18,740
I want to investigate the idea of suffering during sleep.

398
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:29,610
Therefore I will ask her whether she really suffers after going to bed the whole night

399
01:02:29,710 --> 01:02:33,860
until the morning, more than the day time?

400
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:34,540
-Yes I do.

401
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:39,790
-This is so. You are suffering more in the night than in the day time.

402
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:40,960
-Yes.

403
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:47,290
-You suffer from the moment you go to bed or you go to sleep and then you wake up and

404
01:02:47,390 --> 01:02:47,880
you start suffering?

405
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:54,490
-No, the only way that I could get any sleep is with pain killers.

406
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:04,160
Then when I wake up after 3 hours I'm in so much pain, I don't know how to stay awake.

407
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:05,670
-And then you take another pain killer?

408
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:11,160
-Well you can't. You have to wait the pain killers to wear off, 3 hours is not enough time.

409
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:16,570
So I have to wait 3 hours to take more pain killers and then perhaps I will go back to

410
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:21,710
sleep for 3 hours and then it's 8 o'clock in the morning.

411
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:29,160
-My question confirming Lycopodium actually confirmed rather Lachesis than

412
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:35,040
Lycopodium. There are some symptoms of Lycopodium there as well.

413
01:03:35,890 --> 01:03:42,670
Therefore I will ask another symptom, whether she feels bloated in the abdomen

414
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:47,930
whether she has a lot of gas, a lot of eructations?

415
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:54,180
-No.
-She has no gas, no eructation.

416
01:03:55,930 --> 01:04:03,180
-I think I used to, maybe last year but no.

417
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:14,860
-Another symptom that could confirm Lycopodium is whether she has an aggravation

418
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,760
from onions. You can eat onions?

419
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:25,510
-Yes, Greek salad.
-Onions, everything and you enjoy, no problem?

420
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:49,170
-Yes.
-Pain worse lying in bed, did you put?

421
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:58,930
Actually by lying you are not feeling better in pain.

422
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:05,060
-No, not really. It's a funny kind of pain.

423
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:13,540
-So back to the idea of Lachesis I would like to investigate how strong is the symptom

424
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,640
of intolerance of clothing around the neck.

425
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:27,180
-I just never wear anything round my neck.
-You can forget it?

426
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:34,960
-I have a jumper which has a raw neck but it's very lose.

427
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,480
-But you keep on doing this?

428
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:48,410
-No because I know it's not touching my neck. I just don't have any clothes that do that.

429
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:05,680
-So you know what to buy.
-I don't like tight things.

430
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:23,560


431
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:31,730
My daughter often comes behind me and puts her hands arround my neck and I hate it.

432
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:44,730
I have smacked her once. I really hate when she does that.

433
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:55,650
-Tell me something else. You answer if you like, if you don't like you don't answer.

434
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:01,300
Were you faithful to him?
-Yes.

435
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:10,550
-Were you very passionate sexually with him?
-At first.

436
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,910
-Very?
-Yes.

437
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:20,990
-You enjoyed sexual intercourse?
-Yes.

438
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:22,380
-And it was perfect?
-Yes.

439
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:31,290
-Later on what happened? You lost interest?

440
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:43,400
-I didn't exactly lose interest of having sex but lost interest of having sex with him

441
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:56,450
because I didn't like it. He wanted but I didn't.

442
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:19,420
-You were quite easily excitable person sexually, right? -Yes.

443
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:28,780
-By the moment you do not have sex with him, you miss sex or not too much.

444
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:55,030
-Not too much. I can remember complaining to my friends that I have wanted sex too

445
01:08:55,530 --> 01:08:58,150
but not with John.

446
01:09:00,150 --> 01:09:04,870
-And you did not attempt to have sex with somebody outside?

447
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:14,400
-No. I wanted to but I didn't. Fantasy.

448
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:25,850
-You can say, I don't like this question. You know what I' m going to ask you?

449
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:26,650
-No.

450
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:36,160
-Did you have to masturbate sometimes?
-Yes sometimes.

451
01:09:54,990 --> 01:10:01,810
-Here we are stuck with a very difficult decision between Lycopodium and Lachesis

452
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,160
as you can see.

453
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:22,750
Lycopodium is a person which goes for sex and sex which is easy, easy partners.

454
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:31,440
If she was a Lycopodium case, she would most probably have had some sexual

455
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:41,620
relationships, like one time, just to release.

456
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,950
-She denies that.
-I haven't.

457
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:53,700
-And as you can all see, she is quite honest about it.

458
01:10:55,980 --> 01:11:07,670
Therefore the idea of Lachesis again is challenged and the idea of Lachesis again has

459
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:13,520
come up due to intolerance of clothes which is underlined 3 times definitely.

460
01:11:18,520 --> 01:11:22,270
-George the idea of Lycopodium is challenged or Lachesis?

461
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:28,730
-The idea of Lycopodium is challenged.

462
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:30,830
Lachesis will stay with passionate, she will go with masturbation, that is capital in

463
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:43,280
masturbation but will not easily go with another partner because she is emotionally

464
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:52,880
involved in a kind of binding, emotionally involved with some kind of real passion.

465
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:16,140
-Lycopodium is the opposite. They are attached to responsibility and if they find the

466
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:23,350
freedom for no responsibility, they should go for it.

467
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:35,200
-She is taking responsibility for the family actually and she has tolerated quite a lot

468
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:08,560
and what I see is that she is quite calm, the pain is reduced to a considerable degree.

469
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:35,060
So this is the time where you ponder, you think about the case.

470
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:50,130
It's not very easy to prescribe on the case and you may have given because of the right

471
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:52,730
sciatica, as I said, in the very beginning.

472
01:13:54,270 --> 01:14:00,550
I said immediately, these are Lachesis symptoms. I could have given Lachesis and it

473
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:03,070
could have acted.

474
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:09,330
But if you really want a responsible work to know what you're doing and then the person

475
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:15,410
will eventually become better and better in her health, then you will have to investigate

476
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:17,090
in this kind of investigation.

477
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:22,410
Understanding exactly what is the situation and knowing exactly why you are prescribing

478
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:23,790
one remedy or another.

479
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:38,740
What about the desire for sweets which has arisen lately and which points to the idea of

480
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:40,090
Lycopodium?

481
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:48,930
Shall we go straight to Lachesis or shall we go through Lycopodium?

482
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,590
This is the question.

483
01:14:55,590 --> 01:15:06,590
Therefore we can ask some more details to see what she was before and whether

484
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:07,930
anything has changed.

485
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:15,880
Concerning her menses, what can you say about that?

486
01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:23,260
-Before my period my breast is swelling up which is new.

487
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:40,070
-So swelling of breast before menses. What else?

488
01:15:40,170 --> 01:15:52,300
-The period about 3 months ago, my period kept coming early but now it seems to have

489
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,490
settled again.

490
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:03,220
-Before, did you have any problem before menses?

491
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:09,890
You became irritable or weepy or pains in the abdomen?

492
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:26,800
-Mainly if I get any PMT it would be irritable and then a burst of tears and then OK.

493
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:33,440
Usually the day before period comes and then usually my period is fine.

494
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:54,610
-So the disturbance in the menses most probably comes because of the different

495
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:56,460
remedies she has received already.

496
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:09,360
What it appears is that in her hormonal system, it works quite good, the sexual sphere

497
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:15,710
is quite correct, we do not find much problems in that sphere.

498
01:17:16,710 --> 01:17:22,280
That's why we don't see very clearly the premenstrual syndrome of Lachesis where

499
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:28,950
we have all this premenstrual syndrome, relieved immediately with the flow of menses.

500
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:36,060
She has said the same thing, the first day only etc. which points to the idea that even

501
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:42,790
that little disturbance which she has is ameliorated whilst the flow is established.

502
01:17:42,890 --> 01:17:44,390
Correct?

503
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:47,720
-Yes, even the breast goes down when the flow comes.

504
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:53,970
-Can you put this into Repertorisation?

505
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:10,120
What about fears? Do you have any fear?

506
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:16,050
-I feel like my biggest fear at the moment is being on my own.

507
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:29,370
Being a mother of my own since I left.

508
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:36,040
-And having all the responsibility by yourself and carrying everything on your back?

509
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:43,570
Then what are your feelings inside this? That you lost your time, you wasted time?

510
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:48,580
-Yes and I feel ...
-You hate him for that?

511
01:18:48,680 --> 01:19:00,010
-Yes, I hate him for failing.
-You or himself?

512
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:19,240
-Everything. I am 28, I feel that I've already lived a whole life. I'm very tired.

513
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:33,330
-So by this answer and if you could look at her eyes, you see really the deep suffering

514
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:43,000
that has gone through this girl and this deep suffering and how much she tolerated so far.

515
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:52,990
You tolerated a lot, that's why you feel tired. You did not have enough enjoyment.

516
01:19:53,090 --> 01:20:07,000
-That's right. And after I left it was even harder because I had to look after on my own.

517
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:22,080
I thought that leaving would be the end but the last 7 months I've been very hard as well.

518
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:37,070
-And as she describes the inner state, harder and harder, the more we see this impact

519
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:47,400
upon the nerves, the peripheral nerves, that means none of these remedies have gone

520
01:20:47,500 --> 01:21:00,830
deep enough to relieve her from this hatred and anger which is there and all these  feelings.

521
01:21:00,930 --> 01:21:05,830
-And suffering.
-Why did I have to suffer?

522
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:20,830
-Yes, it's not fair. I feel angry because I feel like I did a good thing to leave but now I have this...

523
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:32,910
-And you suffer much more. This actually is the manifestation of suffering on the

524
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:42,080
physical body and that is why you see her in spite of all this suffering, in spite of all this

525
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:50,260
anger inside, she is in a quite good and balanced condition mentally and emotionally.

526
01:21:52,170 --> 01:22:00,250
Your condition mental and emotional could have been much worse in case the whole

527
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:02,610
thing had not manifest in the sciatica.

528
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:06,250
-Yes I agree.

529
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:15,130
-This is what [..]  said who saw her that years ago she had been emotionally dependent

530
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:22,850
[..] so her health has progressed very well over the years.

531
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:29,290
-She is able throughout this manifestation to keep her balance in spite of all these

532
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:33,610
adverse things which are happening in your life.

533
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:43,410
-Yes, now I'm happy with what has happened in my life now. I have to get through this

534
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:49,010
last of this pain, that's what I feel.

535
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:20,850
-There are a lot of other questions of course we can be asking in this case like

536
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:40,390
previous diseases etc. also vaccinations and also whether previous to this affair

537
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:44,140
to this man, you were suffering with another affair?

538
01:23:44,240 --> 01:24:00,890
-No. Not the same way, not bad. No one is ever hit me before. That was the first one.

539
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:05,570
-What about with your tongue? You could hurt him also with your tongue?

540
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:06,840
-Yes.

541
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:26,170
-You will not forgive him very easily.
-I think so, but not to his face because ...

542
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,990
-You will talk badly about him with others, with friends.

543
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:31,260
-Yes.

544
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:39,500
-I hate him very much but you were afraid that he may hit you very hard if you do

545
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:45,360
something in front of his face.
-Yes.

546
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:56,080
-That is again another Lycopodium symptom that you will feel not able to face him and

547
01:24:56,180 --> 01:25:04,460
tell him and face the hurt and the heat.

548
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:24,270
So with this idea I think we can stop and since you are ready, feeling better, you may

549
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:33,020
be able to walk and see what happens. I will bring you the remedy and then we'll have

550
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:36,620
a follow up in 2-3 days before the examination.

551
01:25:44,620 --> 01:25:50,850
It's very interesting the Expert System says, I can not make a decision between

552
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:53,450
Lachesis and Lycopodium!

553
01:26:08,070 --> 01:26:17,680
It says the most probable remedy is Lycopodium and the most probable remedy is Lachesis.

554
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:24,770
-But in the first when we used to have arguments, I did use to fight and shout and just

555
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:28,160
be like him but he was stronger than me.

556
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:38,260
-He would hit you finally so you had to subdue.
-Yes but then I went inside.

557
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:47,040
-Thank you.
-Thank you George.
