1
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,299
-I have a question concerning the rubric you used this morning.

2
00:00:52,350 --> 00:01:01,299
The rubric 'cries when telling their a story'.
I notice in my practice, I don't know the reason but many patients cry

3
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:11,579
during telling their story, I was wondering because there is a few remedies in there, Sep., Puls. and Ign.

4
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,339
Is it really worth using this rubric?
-No.

5
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:30,219
I almost never use this rubric. I almost never into account that rubric but since we are working with certain tools

6
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,939
at this moment, we cannot take it out and bring something else.

7
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:51,469
We have to work with these tools so far as till when we have a better tool. But it is true, most probably

8
00:01:51,490 --> 00:02:01,200
 first of all Ign. is not crying while telling her symptoms, usually. It should not be there at the first place.

9
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:16,429
 Maybe in one of my lectures I have said, if you see Ign. crying at a certain consultation, that does not mean

10
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:28,199
you have to exclude Ign. Ign. may cry sometimes. People take this and said, Vithoulkas said Ign. crying during consultation.

11
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:38,200
The idea is that you don't exclude Ign. if it's crying.

12
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,939
Well Psor. is a difficult remedy to recognize when it's needed.

13
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:25,430
You know that in the books they say, it is the chilly of Sulphur, the chilly remedy of Sulphur. Sulphur is warm.

14
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:43,189
  That means that Psor. is looking dirty, is untidy, is lazy. There is no connection really.

15
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:58,259
The only connection you may say is that both remedies many times are used for skin eruptions which are severally itching.

16
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,939
And the one remedy is warm and is aggravated by warm and the other remedy is cold remedy and

17
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,610
aggravated by cold, very much aggravated by cold.

18
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:29,259
The drafts, the cold especially in the head. They are people who will go out and wear hat in winter.

19
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:41,029
In winter, in summer very seldom. Maybe in summer also.

20
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:56,409
Sometimes when in summer it's a bit cool, especially in Germany, they may put the hat. Here it's very difficult that

21
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:05,089
people will say in the summer I wear a hat because I feel cold in my head. It's very difficult to hear that.

22
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:26,659
What we're interested in is to find the essence of Psor. It is a remedy which is quite anxious, quite easily going into despair.

23
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:37,540
And the anxiety and the despair concerns very much material things.

24
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:52,819
They're anxious mostly they don't have enough money. They have a fear of going into poverty.

25
00:05:52,840 --> 00:06:09,769
 Poverty is something they cannot tolerate like other remedies also. Like Bry., Calc-f.

26
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:20,549
 So it's a cold remedy with a severe aggravation from coldness, despair remedy, easily going into despair

27
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:27,080
 and anxiety about the future. What is going to happen in my business? My business is not doing well.

28
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:36,819
The business are doing quite well, they bring money etc. but still Psor. will have the idea that the business

29
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,819
is not doing well. Worried about the business.

30
00:06:49,840 --> 00:07:07,479
There is an interesting keynote: whenever they're going to have an attack of something, whatever, an influenza

31
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:22,669
 a cold, an epileptic fit, headaches. Before the headaches they feel extremely well and then

32
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:28,870
 the body works perfectly and then the headache comes.

33
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:54,419
-Does that mean that anytime when they have an aggravation before, they have some amelioration of the symptom?

34
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,759
They feel quite well, enthusiastic and then something happens?

35
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,089
-No, no amelioration of the symptom. They may not have amelioration, they may have some pains but the feeling

36
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,739
of the well-being. I fell well and then stop.

37
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:21,119
-So they have some emotional amelioration?
-Emotional and energy wise.

38
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:29,289
The energy is feeling good and emotionally are feeling good, the mind feels clear, I have some pains here, you don't pay attention.

39
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:40,789
If you feel well you have no problem with little things. 'In general I feel well, it's ok, I don't need a remedy'.

40
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:49,069
Many people will say 'I don't need a remedy, I don't have anything', but if you search out you find 20 symptoms

41
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:58,819
but they are not bothered by these symptoms. So actually there is no amelioration of symptom.

42
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:08,720
 No, it's the sense of well-being, of feeling well and then it comes. The storm comes.

43
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:22,689
The most important thing for Psor. which you will find in 95% of the cases is what?

44
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,760
-Total desperation by itching.

45
00:09:48,050 --> 00:10:00,770
-No. This is belonging to some other remedies but they have a characteristic that belongs to them.

46
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,189
-What's typical for Psor. is the offensive discharge.

47
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:17,089
-The offensive perspiration especially, offensive discharges but especially perspiration. In a typical Psor. case

48
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:29,219
you cannot sit next to him. If you work in the office, the whole office smells. That kind of offensiveness

49
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:38,860
that comes out through perspiration. It is not possible to stay next to him, if you work side by side, forget it.

50
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:48,779
You have to go out and breathe. And these people they say, 'I will use antiperspirants, this, that, there is no effect'.

51
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:56,700
Still the smell is coming. It seems that they eliminate all the toxins through their perspiration.

52
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:05,110
This is a great characteristic for the Psor. cases.

53
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,339
Another characteristic?

54
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:30,579
-Great appetite at night.
-The appetite comes in peculiar times.

55
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,799
Eating has to do with their well-being and feeling. They get up at night and they need to eat.

56
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,469
They go and open the refrigerator and they start eating.

57
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:58,399
They are going to have a headache and the appetite increases. And unless they eat, the headache will not subside.

58
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:27,379
Where are the eruptions? The seat of the eruptions mostly are the folds here and behind the knees and in the elbow folds.

59
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:43,459
These are the seats mostly of the eczema, with terrible dry skin, itching, worse with wool. Any wool will make the itching

60
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:53,779
much worse and also in the night in spite of the fact they get warm in the night, the itching becomes worse.

61
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:35,149
Dreams of robbers, this is not important; and danger is there but it's not important. Fear of being alone.

62
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:40,159
This is something which we have to explain a little bit.

63
00:13:50,250 --> 00:14:05,920
They are not secure. Insecurity on the material level and insecurity also when they don't have people around them.

64
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:16,970
Psor. people will have a family, are prone to have people with them. They like it.

65
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:30,119
Nux-v. is the opposite. Platina also. They don't want the family. They are tendencies in these remedies

66
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:41,789
 which are not to be taken literally. Because you may go into mistakes.

67
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:56,559
Somebody says, I want to marry you give Psor., forget it. He has to be chilly, he has to have offensive discharges.

68
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:05,049
He has to have the anxiety the despair, the insecurity about his business and all that.

69
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,990
Then you have the picture of Psor.

70
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:26,779
Fear of marriage. Did we speak about Nux-v.? We've spoken. Fear of marriage in Nux-v., why?

71
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:50,469
Who says fear of marriage is important? Because in Nux-v. he has to have a lot of experiences.

72
00:15:50,490 --> 00:16:00,300
This happens with men mostly, not with women. Women don't have fear of marriage. They always want to marry.

73
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,660
Nobody laughs.

74
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,920
Why? Because you half believe it.

75
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:26,379
But is true to a certain extent that women are more insecure and they want more the security and

76
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:31,400
marriage gives the idea of security.

77
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:54,079
Ok, I'll change it. I will phrase it differently.

78
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,290
 I will say Greek women...

79
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:13,389
You don't give Psor. to all the Greek women because they want to marry.

80
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:26,829
The same way Nux-v. has fear of getting married because has experiences with this woman, with that woman.

81
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:38,059
They have in their own perception that women are basically unfaithful individuals.

82
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,279
If you marry... unfaithful.

83
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:54,029
The idea how Nux-v. perceives because he projects his own experiences into the outside world.

84
00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:06,639
So they have some experiences, an affair with a married woman and then another affair with a married woman and a third affair.

85
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:13,579
He comes to the conclusion that all married women have extramarital affairs. I don't want to marry.

86
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,339
And they are jealous and they are ambitious and they don't want this to happen to them.

87
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:35,299
And this is what makes them fear of getting married.

88
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:42,819
But Lyc. will have fear of getting married from another point of view; because they don't want the responsibility.

89
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,640
They don't want the responsibility of the children. Platina will have fear of getting married for different reasons.

90
00:18:49,840 --> 00:19:00,059
Because they don't want children. Bar-c. also will have fear not of marriage, they will marry but they don't want children.

91
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,299
I'm the baby, you keep me.

92
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:22,709
So take the essentials of the case and put them together. Don't take one portion of what we have said because

93
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:29,730
if you take only one, the whole is lost.

94
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:55,139
-I don't understand the combination of two symptoms in Psor. We like all kinds of skin eruptions.

95
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:10,280
Psor. not only has skin eruptions but offensive skin eruptions which is even better.

96
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:28,979
 If they have offensive, they have even more detoxifying quality in them.

97
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:43,950
Why is Psor. then a remedy for lack of reaction, lack of reactivity? Where can I find that?

98
00:20:52,180 --> 00:21:02,230
-They have an eczema that resists all kind of treatment.

99
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,959
 You give one remedy and then another remedy  and another remedy, especially in children, and you see no reaction.

100
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,969
With other people you will see some reaction, you give some Sulphur and something happens. With Psor.

101
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:27,189
it will not happen anything. And then you give Psor. and it's better but it will take a long time before

102
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:35,259
you can see it is better. That means it gives the idea of a weak reaction.

103
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,979
This is stated in all books, from Kent and the old masters.

104
00:21:54,070 --> 00:22:07,779
Lack of vital reaction, chilly. I will tell you it is the idea of being cold of being chilly, not to get warm.

105
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:24,939
 I mean an organism who cannot get warm like Sil., like Hep., like Ars. and this is even worse, it's very very chilly.

106
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:34,279
So if somebody is very chilly and cannot get warm, then you see lack of vital reaction. It's an expression.

107
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,820
 The idea is behind.

108
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,570
But it's a good question because I had the same question.

109
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:58,799
When we read the Materia Medica many times we read an impression of the patient by the doctor

110
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:11,529
who has attended several cases. He gives an impression and the impression is not always for 100% of the cases.

111
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,390
Profuse sweating.

112
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:53,819
And of course better in lying down. This is also interesting in asthma where they lie down

113
00:23:53,840 --> 00:24:12,549
and they spread their hands and it seems that this position makes them feel better.

114
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:25,989
It's very strange, the position of knee-elbow makes them feel better. The Med., the Kali-c etc.

115
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,569
The position in sleep also makes them better, right side or left side.

116
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:47,639
Why is that? We have some explanations but they are not the real explanation.

117
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:54,579
Can you say, oh he wants pressure on the side where he has the inflammation.

118
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,859
Then another remedy has inflammation, it want to turn on the other side.

119
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,259
So it's not really the physiology, it's something else. It's the individuality.

120
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,030
Puls. is a terrible remedy.

121
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:55,739
You tell her this she will start crying; they cry in such a way that they complain. It's like saying: why did you do this to me?

122
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:08,899
Please say a nice word. I am a tender woman. I am in a tender state. Please hold me, touch me. Give me consolation.

123
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:19,709
 Here we have 'consolation ameliorates'. Actually is the woman who one way or another you must console.

124
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:28,019
If you don't console the good way, the nice way , she will manipulate you to console her on another way.

125
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,399
How she will manipulate you? In different ways. She has ways. She understands, especially the husband, the children.

126
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:55,699
Children they cry in order that the parents will grasp them. They get like this. Each remedy cries in a different way.

127
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:08,520
Ok sweetie, come here. You are nice boy, nice girl.

128
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:27,300
 It's different than Calc-p. You have seen Calc-p. or Cham. or Cina or Nat-m crying.

129
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,640
Will fall down Nat-m. on the floor and will kick.

130
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:50,140
It's totally different, hysteric.

131
00:27:53,340 --> 00:28:06,789
You say, you are hysterical. Then he will look at you, the Nat-m., 'what is he saying now?'  Because they mentalize.

132
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,460
 But Puls.s are acting out of emotions. The emotions are important and you say, 'you cry so easily'.

133
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:23,389
 Yes I cry. In what circumstance? In front of others? Yes in front of others it's even better she will say.

134
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:32,659
 When they have audience to cry then they will feel comfortable, they can do it.

135
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:46,800
They like the people paying attention to them
and that others are sympathetic towards them.

136
00:28:46,821 --> 00:28:54,440
They like consolation.

137
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:25,950
Puls. also can be very aggressive.

138
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:51,149
They can throw a tantrum. You've done this to me. They take this and they can throw it.

139
00:29:51,170 --> 00:30:07,509
But never in the head. There is no real aggression. It is an aggressivity which seeks attention, manipulation.

140
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:18,519
So she will throw things with such a tantrum, so the husband knows that he has to shut up.

141
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:34,259
Be nice to her and then he can go out. Otherwise she will continue the manipulation until she gets the attention;

142
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:47,489
it's her organism you see. She says: I go to my husband and I say, please embrace me, out of the blue, say a nice word.

143
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:53,760
I love you. Thank you. Nice. Then they can go.

144
00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:06,099
Not the Germans of course. I'm talking about the Greek women.

145
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:14,339
You see I don't know how the Germans are behaving in this matter, I don't have the experience.

146
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,499
Maybe they are doing the same but in different ways.

147
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:28,039
But actually the manipulation is there so they can get the attention which they need.

148
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:46,099
Puls. are women or men who are so emotional and the concentration is on the emotional side.

149
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:59,859
Are they sexual? It's very strange. They need tenderness, they need affection, they don't need sex.

150
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:17,129
It's not a sexual remedy. It's rather from medium to low and sometimes from the old times, you see now homosexuality

151
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:31,219
 is much more spread in the societies. In the old times when this was written in the Repertory 'in love with one

152
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:43,839
of her own sex'. Homosexuality. What they were writing actually is the need for tenderness and affection.

153
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:57,409
 You see the Puls. woman does not like aggressiveness. She's not the woman who will challenge a man.

154
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:03,319
 She wants to be next to the man, to be protected, to be consoled, not to challenge.

155
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:18,120
So if she has to challenge, she has an aggressive man, she is afraid and finally she becomes cool. Frigid.

156
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:34,419
 I'm not interested in sexual matters. Then she needs affection. She has a girl friend with whom they speak

157
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:50,139
 they tell each other stories. And then they form a kind of a bond between themselves and Puls. suddenly feels

158
00:33:50,160 --> 00:34:04,649
'I'm in love with that person. What's this?' They
 fell in love and they can go in great problems because

159
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:17,179
in much older times this was considered as very bad and when Puls. finds out that this is the case
they have fallen

160
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:26,110
suddenly in love a man with a man or a woman with a woman, terrible. What shall I do now?

161
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:34,839
And the idea is they don't want sex they want tenderness and tenderness can be given,

162
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:41,600
 woman to woman, they give much more tenderness and they understand the need for tenderness.

163
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:56,169
Where men they just go home, 'ok bring me food, now we go to bed, we finish, now we go'. This for Puls. is...

164
00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:07,419
she does not know where she is. And then she starts either she will react crying for the least reason

165
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:24,739
or manipulating by throwing a tantrum by taking this and throw it but in the wall. The man is there, she throws it there

166
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:34,229
to make sure that it will not come to him. So there is no aggressiveness, still in her tantrum she is sweet.

167
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:53,819
And of course we have the big keynote in Puls. The aggravation from heat. She suffers this, she has to go near

168
00:35:53,840 --> 00:36:08,069
 she has to have air, to open the window. The fresh air and the cool air rejuvenates her.

169
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:22,679
The Puls. will be the first in a party to open the window. She goes there, never mind the house is not hers.

170
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:29,180
She goes to the window and opens it;
it is too stuffy. And flushes of heat, heat.

171
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:42,160
 And that's why she indicated very much during the climacteric period where flushes are tormenting women.

172
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,800
Another keynote is changeable.

173
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:17,699
 We see this changeable element in different actions, functions, ailments.

174
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:31,969
When I was first reading Puls. and it would say, 'the color of the menses changes. One time will be green, blue...'

175
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:42,609
I said, what is this? Is this possible?
It is possible but with a big difference.

176
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:50,509
The color may change according to her, it doesn't change according to you who listen, especially if you are a man.

177
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:59,300
 It doesn't go to blue, to green, to red.
It changes a little bit.

178
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:15,279
A little bit towards the dark side but the woman observes that almost never the menses are the same color.

179
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:33,029
More clots, more dark, more brown, less brown, more red etc. The mood also changes from one hour to another.

180
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:44,099
They are moody and depressed and despaired. And then somebody comes, they have nice company

181
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:57,440
somebody consoles them. The world is nice, they start again. It is easy to change their mood. They are not steady.

182
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:14,669
Also changes the place of pain. You get a pain on the shoulder joint, a pain on the hip joint, on the elbow joint.

183
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:21,920
It's a changeable.

184
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:36,550
It is the idea of the woman. Which is this opera? In Rigoletto I think.

185
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:57,549
It says: a woman is like a feather in the wind. Changes all the time.

186
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:09,299
 The Greek translation which I have in my mind says... wind flower.

187
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:35,199
We go to the idea of signatures, it says Puls. with the wind goes like this and then it goes like that.

188
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,679
The wind blows this way, it goes like this, the wind blows that way, it goes like that.

189
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:48,639
You can say all these nonsense but the fact remains that all flowers with the wind will go this way

190
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:59,670
 and with the other wind will go the other way. And still of course Puls. will do that but it is not the main thrust.

191
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:11,859
If you put your mind into that many times we do say things like that. Kent used to say, I said it a lot but

192
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:28,210
 if you fix your mind and you say Lac-c dog's milk, likes dogs. People who like dogs. Who likes dogs here?

193
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:46,179
87%. 87,45%. It is natural to love dogs.

194
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:58,760
I had a secretary once and I had a little puppy in a box inside my apartment.

195
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,859
 I called her to come to my apartment to bring me something.

196
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:15,959
Then I am in the room and I hear the door opens and she screams. I go out and say, 'what is it?'
'A dog!'.

197
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:28,969
I said, 'A dog? This dog? 1,5 month old little puppy like this? Is this a dog is going to bite you?'

198
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,989
'Take it away!'.

199
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:47,739
I said 'I have been giving you the wrong medicine'.

200
00:42:52,610 --> 00:43:00,080
Fear of dogs. This woman actually she had to take Tuberculinum.

201
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:12,999
When you are sick, you are afraid of dogs, don't like dogs, you don't like cats. You don't touch cats.

202
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:21,819
Cat comes here and Tuberculinum is terrified 'I'm going to become sick now.

203
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:31,160
I think I swallowed a hair from the cat. This house has cats, I don't go'.

204
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:39,669
This is a symptom. But to say I like dogs, I like cats, it's a natural thing.

205
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:53,939
About Puls. you have to know a few more keynotes. Which are these keynotes?

206
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,499
Which is the biggest fear of Puls.?

207
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:13,479
-Being alone?

208
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:26,559
-Being alone. Being forsaken, being abandoned yes. It is a strong fear but this fear is not as tormenting

209
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:32,809
as another fear which is very strong and very tormenting.

210
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:39,850
Fear which really can destroy the life of the patient.

211
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:52,520
Fear of insanity.

212
00:44:54,200 --> 00:45:04,299
They feel 'I'm going crazy'. It's a fear which overwhelms the patient.

213
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:15,289
Now you may say, tomorrow all women are going to take a dose of Puls. because you may have thought that sometimes

214
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:23,309
under stress, you may go insane. No. This is not the case. The case is when without any reason, everything is alright

215
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:32,179
 the fear of insanity overwhelms the person.
The fear of insanity becomes the main problem.

216
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:43,939
 And of course as we described Puls. needs the support of the family, of the people whom she loves.

217
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:57,179
And tenderness etc., it is natural, she will feel fear of being abandoned because there is no this power for fighting for life.

218
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:09,959
Once, as I said, I had a patient from India whose position was a minister in the government of India, a woman.

219
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,920
And she has been to all Homeopaths in India and in Europe.

220
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:31,829
The best. Nobody has given her the correct remedy and she kept on having these problems with the liver.

221
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:39,459
 She had a liver that was misfunctioning and the whole body  was retaining water

222
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,799
 and then she would go like this and then go like that.

223
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:53,120
She came to me and she said, what remedy you will give me?

224
00:46:54,101 --> 00:47:00,350
I was in India, I' m talking about 1964.

225
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:07,090
I said, Pulsatilla.

226
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:19,579
Because she has taken so many remedies, she has read Materia Medica herself. She goes to the Homeopath in Delhi

227
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:25,230
because he is alive I don't want to mention his name. And she says, you know there is a young man here

228
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:37,459
- but I was treating Krishnamurti and that's
why I was a little bit known in these circles -

229
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:48,179
he gave me Puls. He said, you Puls.? You, like a boss, you know Minister in the government, do this, do that.

230
00:47:52,190 --> 00:48:00,939
And the example is to show you that you don't need to have the mental-emotional picture of Puls., you may have

231
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:14,870
 only the physical symptoms. Where the mental and emotional is normal.

232
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:24,859
Because you will come one time I will prescribe Puls. and you will say but she is not crying, she is not manipulative

233
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:37,779
 she is not hungry for consolation, why you give? You don't have to have. Once you have the changeability of symptoms.

234
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:54,099
And of course a few other things which lead me to the idea of Puls. like the heat. In which part of the body the heat is most?

235
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:10,530
Feet. Feet become hot, burning and it has to cool them out of the covers.

236
00:49:10,551 --> 00:49:27,979
 But sometimes you may have a chilly Puls. and especially during a cold,  Puls. may get a feeling of

237
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:39,219
coldness in the back as if there is a wet towel stuck on her back.

238
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:51,459
So there are some chills, wetness and chill on the back where she cannot get rid of this wet towel on the back.

239
00:49:54,940 --> 00:50:10,949
Then of course you have an aversion to warm food, desire for cold food. Aversion to fat, not only aversion but worse from fat.

240
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:37,529
They will have diarrhea from fat. But you may get some Puls who like bread and butter. And they like also creamy things.

241
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:46,619
They have an aversion to pork and worse from pork, if they eat it.

242
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:21,000
Of course they can have different other fears. Fear of the dark, fear of ghosts. These fears are not so strong as the fear of insanity.

243
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:23,979
Also Puls. are like me. They like to walk. Amelioration by walking.

244
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:48,819
Desires cold food but ice-cream. Cold fresh air, cold application, gentle motion, gentle walking.

245
00:52:51,560 --> 00:53:00,499
It is one of the remedies that they don't like sun and they don't like the time of sunset. They become

246
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:10,529
sad during this time. Sunset brings a sadness. It's as if life is going away.

247
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:32,579
Styes. Don't forget the styes in the eyes. They get frequent, repeated styes.

248
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:39,219
These are the things that you have to remember about Puls. If you remember these things you will not miss

249
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,720
a Puls. case, nevermind what it is.

250
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:58,810
-I've got a question. We've always been talking Puls. as a woman. How often does it occur that men need Puls.?

251
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:10,819
-Men need Puls. I remember a man, a builder, you know very rough man who carries the wheelbarrows, strong man.

252
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:21,309
He had come for his stomach and different things. Eventually he told me why he had come.

253
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:36,220
He says, 'I think I am a homosexual'. 'Why?'. 'Because I see a man and I feel that maybe I will be in love with this man'.

254
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:53,659
This is a disturbance that can be cured very quickly with Puls. In the same way the woman who is

255
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:59,419
in love with some of her own kind.

256
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:20,559
This is fear of being in love. They suffer because of that. You give the remedy, they stop suffering.

257
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:29,619
Puls. men in conjunction with Puls. women,
 I would say between 30 and 70%.

258
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:37,299
70% of your cases will be women and 30% will be men.

259
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:48,799
That more or less is the experience but maybe in different countries have different percentages.

260
00:55:53,540 --> 00:56:10,539
The men are tender, exactly the same, they need consolation and confirmation. Puls. men easily become impotent

261
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:19,779
especially if the woman is aggressive.
They cannot handle it.

262
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:49,059
Also the main thing is, you have to memorize this. These are little information, 1,2,3,4,5 you have to memorize.

263
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:57,540
For Puls. we said too many things. But all these are really strong points that will lead you to Puls.

264
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:26,899
-Please, can you differentiate the sadness of Phos. in twilight, when the sunset is and the sadness of Puls.?

265
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:33,419
-They are the same. They are similar.

266
00:57:54,110 --> 00:58:03,339
-Puls. is yielding. Is it possible to suppress Puls. like Staph.?

267
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:23,429
-To suppress Puls.? No, the Puls. does not suffer easily from suppression. Why? Because if you try to suppress

268
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:34,859
 if you are aggressive, she breaks out crying.
 By breaking out crying, she balances where Staph. will not cry.

269
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:45,119
She will take it inside and it is very very dangerous when you have a pain in your soul, in your emotions and

270
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:54,560
 you cannot express that pain. You cannot talk to a friend, you cannot cry, you cannot shout, you cannot bring it out.

271
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,199
 It's going to stay there and eat you up.

272
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:09,139
Also jealousy, if it is expressed, if you have a friend and you express your jealousy you talk about it all the time,

273
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:16,329
 it's not going to damage you as much as will damage you if you don't talk to anybody.

274
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:24,249
You are suspicious your husband or my wife is going out with another man. You are suspicious, you keep it

275
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:31,649
 it's absolutely sure you damage your heart and your blood pressure will start rising etc.

276
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:43,899
If you can talk especially with the person concerned, then you will save a lot of suffering. This is a general rule.

277
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:53,899
Sometimes I' m surprised some people they just perceive this and they write a whole book. A whole book of how

278
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,899
to express your emotions, it's a whole literature about it.

279
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:06,809
And it's simple things that they have to be understood as common senses things.

280
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:18,139
And they blow it into a big book, best selling.
You cry out your pain.

281
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:47,919
-Is Puls. reactive as a disappointment of love? Will she also be grieving over years or she will think

282
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:50,299
well there are other people in this world as well?

283
01:00:50,320 --> 01:01:01,850
-She will be crying a lot and she will cry more than another woman who is more healthy. A healthy woman

284
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:14,699
 will cry, she has an affair, nice affair. But if the man leaves her, she immediately reasons out  that this is not

285
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:24,139
 the right person, ok. It would be nice because I like him but still one week, two weeks, she is finished.

286
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:38,859
Puls. will cry for 6 months and will not have the side effects of the grief as the Ign. or the Nat-m  may have.

287
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:54,739
Because it will save her, will balance. Crying out is a big outlet for a lot of problems and if we were crying is like oozing

288
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:05,549
eczema is like oozing out. Actually we have so much pain inside us, kept inside

289
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:10,429
  that we should be crying most of us, we should be crying, crying.

290
01:02:11,950 --> 01:02:25,419
I'm too proud to cry, the other one says, I'm going to be ridiculous if I cry, the other one says, I'm going to be considered

291
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:39,850
 as a crazy person, so you keep it inside and this is how it develops your clientele, to be treated by you.
