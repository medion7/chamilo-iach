1
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,720
-What is the problem?

2
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:35,960
-I try to tell the story in sequence. The symptoms, because of which I come, last back

3
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:44,470
15 years. It's started suddenly after the delivery of my first child.

4
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:57,210
I had to deliver in the evening and the next morning I woke in an unknown room, I felt

5
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:06,960
the emptiness in my head. I stood up, there was a door, I went in and I took a shower.

6
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:14,710
I was amazed what I'm doing here, I was not amazed what I'm doing here, there was a

7
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:24,710
breakfast beside my bed and then I sat down and I was just staring to the emptiness.

8
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:32,210
For about one hour and then the door opened and the nurse came in and she said

9
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:42,970
don't you want to see your child? I said, yes I have given birth to a child and from then

10
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:51,710
on I had again and again such sequences of blackouts. I forgot to go and get my children

11
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:58,920
from school, I have 4 children and every birth it was a sudden fall down and I slightly

12
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:05,670
recovered and after the next delivery, the same happened again.

13
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:13,760
At the same time I had difficulties in wording, in speaking, I used the wrong words, I couldn't

14
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:21,500
control my tongue anymore. That improved too but at the same time I'm an interpreter too

15
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:29,260
and even though I had these difficulties I could work as an interpreter for 8 hours the day

16
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:41,000
without any mistakes. And when I went out of the cabin, it started all over immediately.

17
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:49,010
-Is she suffering with anemia? -No.

18
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:55,510
-And the third symptom I couldn't estimate how the ground on which I was, was.

19
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:01,890
Sometimes it turned roundish, sometimes I couldn't estimate the distance.

20
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:10,920
I had the impression that it was coming up to my nose, like the ground was broken and

21
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:18,170
I couldn't walk or I couldn't really see the color. It was very dramatic after the deliveries and

22
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:28,660
this state comes too in a more mild form, when I'm emotionally upset.

23
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:46,910
-Sudden loss of memory after pregnany. Did she ever had any concussion?

24
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,870
- I had a neurological check-up.

25
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:57,880
The first neurologist said it was an emboli in my brain and I said that can't be because it comes

26
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:05,390
on again when I'm emotionally excited; so I went to a second neurologist and he said

27
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:15,670
narcolepsy because on the E.E.C. you have in my waken state, you have the reason of sleep.

28
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:22,380
Waves like in sleep. It's very exhausting for me to fixate at certain point, I just stay into the

29
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:28,880
emptiness. It just happened to me again, some days ago, when I left the airport of Dusseldorf

30
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:36,890
I went through the first control, it was a chair, I sat down and everything was just gone.

31
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,400
I just don't think. I have no thoughts.

32
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:53,130
-There is an complete emptiness, nothing.

33
00:04:53,230 --> 00:05:03,900
-Nothing. The second said narcolepsy, I wasn't content with that either so I went to see

34
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,400
a third neurologist and he said, he can't really explain that but he thinks it's a latent

35
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:17,920
depression which always comes up after the delivery.

36
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:27,670
-But it was a definite change in the encephalogram? They were able to do an encephalogram

37
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:33,920
during the crisis or even outside of the crisis?

38
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,490
-It's difficult to say. They put these electrons on my head and then I had to sit down and

39
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,960
as soon as I don't have to do anything, as soon as I don't push myself to do anything

40
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,960
I fall into that state.

41
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,720
-She can fall back so easily?

42
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:59,220
-Into here during the lecture when there is break of some minutes, I just fall back into it.

43
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:10,720
I just sit there and I stare in front of me and I don't hear anything, I don't see anything.

44
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,970
-She never has any picture?

45
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,470
-I see but I don't produce any thoughts. Recently it happened to me when I was on the

46
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,470
telephone. I was on the telephone and I said, yes I will look it up immediately.

47
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:29,970
After I had said, I immediately forgot it, so I stayed on the telephone and the other guy

48
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:35,720
is waiting but I forgot it and so he waited and I stayed on the telephone and me too I had

49
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,710
forgotten that I was on the telephone too.

50
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,220
-So she put down the telephone?

51
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:53,460
-No, I stayed like this and then suddenly I heard that voice and I got frightened.

52
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,220
-Then she remembered?

53
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:03,530
-Yes, I can recall, I can remember. The neurologist didn't talk about weak memory but

54
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:24,500
deficiency in concentration.

55
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,470
-Is she a medical doctor?

56
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,470
-Healing practitioner.

57
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,690
-What she was doing before?

58
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:39,940
-I was a simultaneous interpreter.

59
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:46,440
-Did she push herself too much? She lost herself in the effort?

60
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:53,190
-The first time it happened I was in a state of exhaustion.

61
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,440
-When it was the first time?

62
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,690
-After delivery.

63
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,190
-What age?

64
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:12,680
-33.

65
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:20,440
-She can recall things of the past. I had no problems after the delivery, no problems at that

66
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:25,190
time; the first time I went back to interpretation, it was two months after the delivery and I had

67
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:32,440
to learn about 200 vocabularies, over night in two different languages.

68
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:39,490
I had no problems with this.

69
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:44,460
-Has this ever happened during driving?

70
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:50,210
-No because then I'm intense. When I' stressed, never.

71
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:53,200
-She has to relax to happen.

72
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,950
-Yes.

73
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:09,700
-This delusions that the floor is curved or broken come frequently?

74
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,710
-No they don't come very frequently, they come in certain emotional situations.

75
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:34,210
Like when I pick up my sister from the airport or when I say goodbye to a good friend of mine.

76
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:42,200
-She was married the man who loved or she loved somebody and then she broke away with

77
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,210
him and then she married somebody else?

78
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,490
-I have been married for 25 years.

79
00:09:50,590 --> 00:10:18,860
-I didn't ask how many years she was married. I asked something else.

80
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,110
She has a good relationship now with her husband?

81
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:31,360
-Yes.

82
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,860
-She has dreams?

83
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,810
-Hardly.

84
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,810
-She can not remember her dreams?

85
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,310
-No.

86
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:48,060
-She has any dream which she remembers, a vivid dream?

87
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,360
-No, but it's always the same pattern. When I have a special day, on the next morning

88
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:57,860
I always dream that I lose something and that I can't find something that I definitely need

89
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:09,860
for the next morning. And then I wake up and I'm sweating.

90
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,360
-She wakes up in a fright?

91
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,360
-Wet with sweat.

92
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:23,360
-So what she feels is losing is very important.

93
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:32,860
-For example my shoes.

94
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,360
-Anything else?

95
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:41,360
-I'm always tired, as far as I can remember I've always being tired and I have a sudden

96
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:47,610
attacks of tiredness throughout the day which I break down in energy that I hardly can make

97
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:53,360
it home. I'm driving home with my car and then I get panic when I see the traffic light

98
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:59,110
turns red because that is gonna cost me 1 1/2 minute to go home and then I'm home and

99
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:06,350
never mind that the kids are around I say, make yourself something to eat, I have to sleep.

100
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:30,960
And I go immediately for sleep. And that is usually 1-2 o'clock at noon.

101
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,210
-Always has she been like this?

102
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,960
-Always.

103
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,710
-She examined the thyroid ever?

104
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:49,210
-It was always on the edge.

105
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,220
-Is she warm or cold?

106
00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:03,730
-I'm always freezing.

107
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:09,460
-When she gets into that sudden weakness, is she more cold?

108
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,720
-Yes.

109
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:17,720
-She has chills?

110
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:31,210
-Yes chills.

111
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,460
-Is she very fastidious?

112
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,710
-I'm terribly untidy. Only not in my work.

113
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:47,710
-Otherwise she is... because she does not have much energy or it's her character like that?

114
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:54,470
-Both.

115
00:13:54,570 --> 00:14:02,210
-Menses are regular? Before menses irritability?

116
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:09,960
-Nothing. I forget when it comes.

117
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:15,960
-It comes always in the day, always in the night or it can be anything?

118
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:26,710
-I don't know. The only thing I know is that it stops for one day and then it starts all over

119
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:39,710
again. Always.

120
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:48,210
-Menses interrupted. Any constipation?

121
00:14:48,310 --> 00:15:00,290
-No. I have to pay attention very much to what I eat. I can't tolerate some things like carbohydrates if I

122
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:11,030
eat a plate of spaghetti I can't even walk for 10 m., I have to lie down for a sleep.

123
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:16,290
-She is worse with carbohydrates. What else?

124
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:31,780
-Spaghetti, bread, when I eat meat I get very excited. I reduced my food to fresh fruits

125
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,780
vegetables.

126
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,290
-She likes them also?

127
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:41,540
-Yes and raw fish.

128
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,040
-You eat in Germany raw fish or herself only?

129
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,540
-They eat in Japan and we have a lot of Japanese in Dusseldorf and you can eat that in

130
00:15:50,640 --> 00:16:01,790
Dusseldorf. I get along very well with this.

131
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,790
-How much thirst?

132
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,290
-Not much.

133
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:10,170
-Perspiration?

134
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:16,670
-None unfortunately. I realize that sometimes I make like a special treatment, I put hot water

135
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:22,420
bottles in my bed and I try to get to sweat and it is the only possibility for me to wake the next

136
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:29,170
morning and be recovered, be refreshed.

137
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,410
-She does what?

138
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:38,120
-When she puts a lot of hot water bottles into her bed and covers up and sweats.

139
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,830
Sweating makes her next morning to feel refreshed.

140
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,580
-So sweating makes her feel good?

141
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:55,580
-Yes but otherwise I don't sweat ever.

142
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:05,590
-But she has to heat up, like sauna. How she feels emotionally?

143
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,830
-Up and down.

144
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:14,690
-Changing moods.

145
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,190
-Do you have dryness?

146
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,680
-A little bit.

147
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:29,190
-Not very much. Ever the tongue sticks up on the palate?

148
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:53,860
-Not that way but it is dry.

149
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:02,360
-For 9 years I have been in homeopathic treatment. I always take 2 years with every

150
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,610
homeopath because never a remedy worked. The only thing that once worked was

151
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:14,060
Phosphoric Acid.

152
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,820
-What did it do Phosphoric Acid?

153
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,330
-I suddenly had wings on my back, I couldn't walk anymore, I was just running and then

154
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:27,310
I don't know if there is any connection but I took one sip of coca-cola and within two

155
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:35,560
days it was like I was going out and I was falling back.

156
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:44,810
And I took it again but nothing. Since then I have had several remedies which didn't work.

157
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,780
-Sepia she had?

158
00:18:47,880 --> 00:19:03,780
-Nothing. Natrum Muriaticum for years. Helleborus.

159
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:12,030
-She has self-confidence herself?

160
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:19,780
-It depends. Not here.

161
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:30,030
-I see she has too much actually. She is afraid of anything? Thunderstorms fear, fear of

162
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:35,530
dark, fear of death?

163
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:49,780
-Fear of economic crush.

164
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,530
-How much salt she takes?

165
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,280
-Normal.

166
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,530
-She likes lemon?

167
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,280
-No.

168
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,030
-She is restless?

169
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:06,530
-Very.

170
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:13,820
-What do you do? You just walk up and down? You take the telephone and you walk?

171
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:26,310
-I'm jogging or I'm cleaning.

172
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,780
-In a hurry inside?

173
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:36,030
-Always.

174
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,280
-And others must hurry also?

175
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:45,530
-No.

176
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,320
-Any salivation during night?

177
00:20:49,420 --> 00:21:09,830
-No.

178
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,580
-How much water she drinks?

179
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,070
-One liter.

180
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:29,070
-One liter the day, 5 glasses?

181
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:35,820
-More.

182
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:41,570
-Any bleeding from nose?

183
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,320
-No.

184
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:55,070
-Tired, tired, tired but one time...total exhausted?

185
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,330
-Yes.

186
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,580
-Does she remember having skin eruption as a child?

187
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:15,320
-Yes on my left hand between the fingers.

188
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,820
-How it went away?

189
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:24,830
-With French homeopathy. Many, many remedies in the day.

190
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,740
-What age started with this syndrome?

191
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,480
-When I was 33.

192
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:44,970
-Did she have any time loss, she couldn't remember, any slight incident before?

193
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:51,550
-No.

194
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:55,800
-What other things she was suffering in her life?

195
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:05,810
-I have chronic bronchitis, always, the whole winter.

196
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:08,800
-And then she has dyspnea, she coughs a lot?

197
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:15,260
-Cough a lot, a lot of mucus and never fever.

198
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:21,250
-Cough that brings mucus and dyspnea?

199
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,500
-No dyspnea.

200
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,750
-And the whole winter goes like this?

201
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,260
-Yes.

202
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,000
-It starts when?

203
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:36,720
-In October and it goes up to March.

204
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,220
-All winter she coughs?

205
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,470
-The cold comes and then I'm tired for one week, I don't know why, then I have this cold

206
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:54,470
for about 3 weeks and then there is a break for 2-3 weeks and then it comes over again.

207
00:23:54,570 --> 00:24:00,390
For some years I have problems with my lymph nodes. I have checked and there is nothing

208
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:11,640
to be found. I always have throbbing pains when I'm stressed, after alcohol, after spaghetti

209
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:20,140
or other things and now there is a permanent pain which I realize when I have certain

210
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,390
position, during sleep.

211
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:23,523
-Where is the pain?

212
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:27,714
-In the axilla.

213
00:24:42,653 --> 00:24:50,637
-When she is depressed, do you think of suicide?
-Never.

214
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:57,810
-Do you enjoy sometimes and sometimes you go down? You are very excitable?

215
00:24:57,946 --> 00:25:11,122
-Yes terribly like I've drunk too much coffee, so excited.

216
00:25:11,683 --> 00:25:16,293
Several times during the day this state comes on.

217
00:25:16,435 --> 00:25:25,956
-Of excitement?
-Of thoughts. What I want to do, what I intend to do.

218
00:25:35,372 --> 00:25:40,880
-And these thoughts come during the day, during the night in bed?

219
00:25:41,196 --> 00:25:50,339
-Mainly during day time. But I can push myself like having drunk very strong coffee.

220
00:25:50,684 --> 00:25:54,300
I can do that myself, just powering me on, push me on.

221
00:26:08,932 --> 00:26:11,604
-How is her sleep?
-Good.

222
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:16,242
-You can sleep right through the night or you can wake up?

223
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:23,515
-Normally I sleep well, recently I didn't sleep well when I was at the sea but that calmed down
again.

224
00:26:25,587 --> 00:26:31,547
-How she is at the sea?
-Not so good?

225
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:37,340
-Sexually how you feel?
-Weak.

226
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:46,203
-She is too tired. If she is not feeling well, what she wants to do?

227
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:55,074
To go by herself, sitting on another room?
-Just sleep. Always sleep.

228
00:26:55,995 --> 00:27:05,635
-What is your character?
-Very unbalanced. I can get very aggressive in certain situations.

229
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,333
-Which situations?
-When I'm in front of an authority.

230
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:17,395
-She took Causticum?
-No.

231
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:23,643
-First I have to kick.

232
00:27:27,155 --> 00:27:30,883
-Kick by words?
-Yes.

233
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:49,691
-If she has a fight or an argument how she will react?

234
00:27:49,731 --> 00:27:55,723
-There are certain topics where I can't restrain myself

235
00:27:56,171 --> 00:28:01,738
and then I go through for any price
never mind how badly I get hitten.

236
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:10,626
-What about these topics, politics?
-When somebody has been treated unfairly.

237
00:28:21,218 --> 00:28:26,378
-She takes sweets?
-No.

238
00:28:32,266 --> 00:28:39,698
-In some situations I'm very close to tears, for example in the last term,

239
00:28:40,786 --> 00:29:00,194
 the last afternoon was so heavy for me, so this time I booked my flight earlier, so I can leave on Friday noon.

240
00:29:01,603 --> 00:29:05,403
-She doesn't want to be in the afternoon.

241
00:29:05,915 --> 00:29:18,987
Why? Because of separation from friends?
-Yes.

242
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:27,514
-She doesn't stand the separation, good bye.
-Yes.

243
00:29:28,147 --> 00:29:30,762
-Separation, that is the problem.

244
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:42,522
 If you see somebody suffering, you are very sympathetic? You suffer a lot?

245
00:29:43,234 --> 00:29:44,738
-It's getting worse and worse.

246
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:51,922
This summer it was really bad. I hardly could watch a child
taking off a splinter out of his foot.

247
00:29:53,986 --> 00:29:57,362
I though I'm going to faint.

248
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:03,450
-If she sees blood coming out, she will faint?
-Normally not.

249
00:30:07,418 --> 00:30:17,915
-If her children are suffering, she becomes ...?

250
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:21,779
-It's very hard to take this.

251
00:30:24,274 --> 00:30:29,362
-When she is coughing in winter does she has lose urine?

252
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,922
-No but when I laugh.

253
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:42,122
-Then it's a big problem.
-It's a flooding.

254
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:54,120
-What shall we do?

255
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:34,870
With her case one thing that we have to understand is what is happening.

256
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:46,870
I say we have to know the diagnosis because of the prognosis of the case.

257
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:59,870
A simple weakness of the legs it may be nothing at all, it may be the beginning of multiple

258
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:06,120
sclerosis or the beginning of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

259
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:12,110
The prognosis is totally different and therefore your strategy for repeating the remedy, for

260
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:16,370
expecting results, is totally different.

261
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:35,150
That is why in every case, it is important to understand what is the underlying pathology.

262
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:41,150
You can never be absolute about these things but since the organism is such a complicated

263
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:51,400
machine with millions and trillions of functions!

264
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:57,650
So what is the pathology in her case? We have certain facts.

265
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:04,400
First of all, a blockage, everything goes away, that's one thing.

266
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:23,430
The second fact is that the electroencephalogram is affected, presenting rhythms of sleep.

267
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:28,180
Do you understand that?

268
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:42,390
The encephalogram says that she goes into sleep but she, herself does not go to sleep.

269
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:52,890
She is awake but blank. What is the pathology? The pathology is narcolepsy.

270
00:33:52,990 --> 00:34:01,900
Narcolepsy is when from one moment to the next, the organism switches off to sleep

271
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:12,140
and then back and then back. Not in her case. So what is the pathology?

272
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:30,150
Who can give me some idea of what might be the pathology?

273
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:43,650
You collect all the information because you want to know also the remedy and the pathology.

274
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:53,900
The question that I would put in such a case, is whether the pathology is due to some

275
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:07,890
emotional shock, an automatic switch off of the organism to stop remembering?

276
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:17,090
I don't want to remember on a sub-conscious level, because if you ask her on a conscious

277
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:24,850
level, she will say I don't want to forget anything, correct?

278
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:32,600
On a subconscious level the organism tries to forget something and then this phenomenon

279
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:53,600
happens or is it a syndrome or a symptom which has underlying pathology?

280
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,850
What can be the pathology?

281
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:04,310
In case we may have some pathology here, what can it be?

282
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:16,810
A functioning of the brain and the heart which is similar to the one that happens when we

283
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:29,570
fall asleep. This is what it is said by the encephalogram.

284
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:37,840
That is one possibility of a pathology. A functioning that happens, similar to the one that

285
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:43,100
happens during sleep.

286
00:36:43,200 --> 00:37:02,090
The third possibility is when due to dysfunctioning of certain organs, the liver or

287
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:33,850
the thyroid we have problems with memory which may end up into serious pathology eventually.

288
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:43,840
What happens in this case? I want to understand. When I give her the remedy I want to

289
00:37:43,940 --> 00:38:01,600
expect certain things.

290
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:16,850
Is anybody here who would like to ... let's hear more. We like to hear the opinion of the

291
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:26,810
psychiatrist or the neurologist who had given us an opinion yesterday which I think it's

292
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,060
very good.

293
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:37,060
I searched for this syndrome in English, I don't know how it's called but definitely this is

294
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:50,560
the diagnosis, the syndrome affective loss of tonus.

295
00:38:50,660 --> 00:39:00,310
I like her diagnosis. So I like to hear her opinion in this case as well.

296
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:06,310
-For this case I have no diagnosis and I don't even know what is going on with this case.

297
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:15,060
I personally find it very difficult this case and I find very difficult to find the remedy.

298
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:23,810
I would need to see the EEC, EEG and I think it would necessary to take EEG at different

299
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:32,810
times, not just one EEG, in different situations.

300
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:44,310
I don't believe it's a narcolepsy and I don't believe either it's an brain disease.

301
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:51,310
I'd rather think it's your second possibility that these processes go on, on a sub-conscious

302
00:39:51,410 --> 00:40:01,820
level but this is my personal opinion.

303
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,060
-We know that the state started with the first delivery but we never asked how the first

304
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:17,380
delivery was for her, how she experienced it? That would be for me very important question.

305
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:53,310
-I tried to answer the questions. First of all to my own birth, it must have been a nightmare

306
00:40:53,410 --> 00:41:19,470
for several days and several nights. I know every detail.

307
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:40,370
After she tried several times without success to get me aborted by using knitting needles

308
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:57,620
and that was to the first story that she left to tell. When my sister nearly brought friends home

309
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:17,450
my sister too was an unsuccessful abortion. I never wanted to have kids. I always thought it

310
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:30,120
would be nonsense to put children in this world. If at all I would adopt children and the

311
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:49,730
second point was that I was so afraid to lose a child that I thought I wouldn't survive this.

312
00:42:49,830 --> 00:43:03,230
The first birth of my own children has to be introduced because I was over the date and they

313
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:17,730
were no contractions and the cervical region was very tight and it didn't move on and I got

314
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:30,730
an infusion and finally I said I want anesthesia in my back.

315
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:42,900
The second delivery was shorter and the third delivery went over in half an hour but the

316
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:54,400
symptoms remained exactly the same. Afterwards I withdraw to the toilet.

317
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:20,730
And after the fourth delivery I went to the toilet and I didn't tell anybody and nobody knew

318
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:27,230
and I forgot that I was there. The only thing I remember was that it was heating on the floor

319
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:58,150
and it was comfortable and I was sitting there. It was like a time played that was turned over.

320
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:06,640
-It's interesting. Still my original question for me, in order to be able to make a prognosis

321
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:17,280
if I give a remedy and I want to know what to expect, this is the question I want to answer

322
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:30,660
at this moment. I want to answer what is happening in physiology and pathology, what

323
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:38,900
might be happening? Because you can not know, she has been examined by several neurologists

324
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:58,570
who could not really say. That means we have to have an idea only, not certainty.

325
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:06,080
-Nevertheless you have to do thorough blood examinations because she is talking about

326
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:16,240
constant pain in her lymph nodes, which specially comes up after alcohol.

327
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:25,740
I think in every case you have to exclude a hematological blood disease.

328
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:36,910
-The blackouts are for 15 years and the problem on the lymph nodes is only the last 4-5

329
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:45,910
years. So it can not be connected, it might be a consequence of whatever it might happening.

330
00:46:46,010 --> 00:47:02,270
What I was interested is that she said in cases of alcoholism, you have lymph nodes, pain.

331
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:11,060
Is this correct? How do you know that?

332
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:18,720
-It may be indication for Hodgkin's and then, in this disease after alcohol the lymph nodes, which

333
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:29,980
are diseased, may be painful. It's a so called B symptom.

334
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:40,530
-But in case of Hodgkin's not in every case of alcoholism.

335
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:46,530
-To ask the patient what was the mental state during the first pregnancy? How was the

336
00:47:46,630 --> 00:48:07,790
emotional and mental state?

337
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:16,530
-To get a child was a decision of my head. I was already pretty old and I thought I would

338
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:31,040
miss out on something. The pregnancy was just going along like this. I had no problems

339
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:53,950
at all, I put on a little bit of weight but nobody saw it and I was just curious.

340
00:48:54,050 --> 00:49:02,200
But there was another question, the first remark concerning paralysis.

341
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:15,200
Paralyzed is a word that I use very often. For example last summer, when this incontinence

342
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:28,700
started, when I was laughing, it always happened to be with my sister and I always said

343
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:40,220
stop it, stop it, I'm paralyzed. My face was paralyzed by laughing and everything was just

344
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:51,950
flowing, tears, urine, everything.

345
00:49:52,050 --> 00:50:06,120
And very often when I have a stressful argument with somebody, whom I'm don't  trust, I have like

346
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:12,960
a paralysis on my face, like a cramp on my face.

347
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:29,120
I'm just able to move my lips slightly, open and close, can't smile anymore.

348
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:41,620
-Very good. So we have analyzed the case inside out.

349
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:53,280
For me the way that I see the case is that there are several facts.

350
00:50:53,380 --> 00:51:02,790
One is that the brain is like going to sleep. The second fact is sudden exhaustion.

351
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:16,030
The third fact is, exhaustion in general. The fourth fact is that this happens only if she is

352
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:31,790
relaxing, when she tries to concentrate, never happens and therefore my conclusion of what

353
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:42,850
is happening physiologicalwise is that, what happens when you are very exhausted

354
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:57,090
you go to sleep. What happens when, in spite of exhaustion, you push yourself to be awake

355
00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:05,100
most probably blood is sending out, through the vascular system to the brain.

356
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:16,850
In her case, there is a point where the arteries they just give up and they are paralyzed and

357
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:34,260
the blood just flows, keeping her awake. But it isn't nourishing all the cells and all the synapses

358
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:41,820
so she can remember where she is, who she is etc.

359
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:55,580
It's a state between awakening and sleeping due to- we agreed- a paralysis to a local

360
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:00,320
paralysis of the arteries.

361
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:09,740
I say that in connection of course with the remedy which I came to the conclusion finally that

362
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:13,990
she needs.

363
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:29,490
Especially when she related that severe loss of urine while laughing.

364
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:43,980
Also when she described her antithesis, her repulsion to authority and the need to kick

365
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:53,230
the authority.

366
00:53:53,330 --> 00:54:09,650
Therefore I come to the conclusion that the problem is functional but on a quite deep level.

367
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:20,650
But there is no anatomy, there is no gross pathology at all. Therefore with the remedy we're

368
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:34,900
going to prescribe we have to expect cure of this case to a considerable degree.

369
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,450
That means from the severe loss of time and place, we come to minute things which may be

370
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:49,640
happen, then the arteries they just give up and they go into paralysis, as she describes.

371
00:54:49,740 --> 00:55:12,250
happening; we give a tonus to the arteries and the bladder.

372
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:17,240
I come to this conclusion that it's only functional because the way she describes different

373
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:24,740
facts. For instance, I can learn very fast, I can remember two languages etc.

374
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:31,750
When she is under pressure, that means when the blood is flowing, there is no problem.

375
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:54,770
When the organism either very tired or very relaxed, because she says if I relax, this may

376
00:55:54,870 --> 00:56:06,950
Through the symptomatology that was put in her case, the remedy Causticum is appearing

377
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:15,120
quite strongly.

378
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:35,310
So you may be lucky to get rid of these nonsense.

379
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:46,210
Have you ever heard that before? No. It's the first time I hear this syndrome.

380
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:55,450
I've never met it again but still we are able to put it together.

381
00:56:55,550 --> 00:57:01,700
Neither in the Materia Medica it is described, in the way she does.

382
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:17,120
In the Materia Medica, we describe paralysis of local organs, larynx, vocal chords, bladder.

383
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:36,370
So paralysis of arteries on the brain, we say.

384
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:41,620
Put the analysis. Do you see this?

385
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:49,120
Loss of memory, difficult speech, sensation of emptiness, weakness of memory for what

386
00:57:49,220 --> 00:58:01,880
it was about to do, sudden weakness, sudden chilliness, intermitted, worse farinaceous food.

387
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:18,620
All the symptoms she has said, 21 symptoms, cough in winter, can not support injustice,

388
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:27,040
aversion to sweets. Aversion to sweets in her case becomes important because

389
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:34,190
Causticum usually, 90% of the cases do not like.

390
00:58:34,290 --> 00:59:00,610
Involuntary urination...It says only Causticum, don't think of any other remedy.

391
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:08,350
We put all your symptoms so easy, how is that possible that for 9 years...

392
00:59:08,450 --> 00:59:10,110
-9 years, 5 homeopaths.

393
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:15,860
-9 years, 5 homeopaths could not have thought of that simple remedy, which the whole

394
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:30,600
class...How many prescribed Causticum?

395
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,810
-How many points to this case?

396
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:44,440
-Not many. If I had not asked the last question, I would give you more marks but the last

397
00:59:44,540 --> 01:00:06,450
question, I asked in front of the class, the marks came down.

398
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:17,440
Wait until you find a difficult case, then you get the 100 marks.

399
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:23,860
You don't need more confirmation. Once you come to the idea that it is a functional

400
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:35,360
paralysis and then you come to the idea that she is really meant, what she said and if

401
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:45,120
you remember last time, I made a remark with Uta.

402
01:00:45,220 --> 01:01:03,890
She jumped... that means she was serious on what she said, because I have seen it

403
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:19,350
previous time how strongly, I got him, I kill him, that saved her actually.

404
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:27,860
Because when she said that, I said here it is the remedy. And after that, it was easy.

405
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:32,610
Because I immediately connected her reaction previously with what she was saying.

406
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:57,780
I've told you Causticum will jump on the street and try to hit you because you hit the donkey.

407
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:03,440
He will kill you. If you do something which they feel it's injustice, they jump.

408
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:15,440
They can not retain, they can not hold it where other people will say, that's an injustice.

409
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:25,110
That's the world. I don't like injustice. Who likes injustice? Is anybody who likes injustice

410
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:34,530
to himself or to others? I don't believe there is anybody but Causticum has to lash out.

411
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:39,280
That's it.

412
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,780
-It's like a motor.

413
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:50,780
-Yes, you can't stop it. I have cases of video, they say on the street I will lash even if

414
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:56,530
there is a bigger man and I know maybe he will hit me, I can't stop it.

415
01:02:56,630 --> 01:03:03,450
I will just lash and try to hit him because the feeling of injustice is there.

416
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:10,450
Remember this for Causticum. We ask many times, do you like injustice? It's not that.

417
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:20,700
It's this. A very good example.

418
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:29,120
-I understand that the paralysis in Causticum is supposed to be gradual.

419
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:39,110
-Not gradual, local. That means it can paralyze only a portion of the organism.

420
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:50,810
Some nerve on the face, on the trigeminal, it can paralyze the vocal chords.

421
01:03:50,910 --> 01:04:10,270
What potency do you like? What potency you will give in this case?

422
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:29,060
Who said CM highest. Who says 50M? Who says 10M? Who says 1M? Who says 200?

423
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:41,980
Who says 30? 12?

424
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:47,230
200.

425
01:04:47,330 --> 01:05:01,480
-Why?

426
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:14,730
-Because the organism is exhausted. She is running on exhaustion all the time.

427
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:31,150
Therefore high stimulation may not be felt at all. So I think 30 would be too low, 200 is

428
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:37,150
a good prescription for her, to see what happens and then eventually we will repeat it in

429
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:44,650
case, she may go a few months free of the symptom and then maybe she will start coming
