1
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:34,000
Now I want to continue with strategies that we have to follow under different circumstances.

2
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:51,667
Sometimes we prescribe on one symptom, sometimes we prescribe on a psychological make-up,

3
00:00:51,771 --> 00:01:03,042
sometimes we prescribe on different things.
There are different strategies and these have a logic behind.

4
00:01:04,354 --> 00:01:12,917
 Which is the first strategy that you
 have to follow in every case?

5
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:28,417
The first strategy is the one that Hahnemann is mentioning. And he says, the totality of the symptoms.

6
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:34,646
Go to the totality, find the totality and
give the remedy that covers the totality.

7
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:45,958
That as a strategy is the first strategy
 that we always follow. First strategy.

8
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:59,104
 So you followed this strategy, you took all the symptoms of the patient and you repertorize

9
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:12,531
 and you find out that does not give you an answer. What are you going to do?

10
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:25,250
Because you took the totality and you have 20 symptoms and if you take 16 of them you give Sepia

11
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:36,906
but if you take the rest 4 plus 11, that
means 15, you give Natrum muriaticum.

12
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:53,219
But if you take, out of the 20, you take 8, you give Phosphorus. And if you take 5, you give  Medorrhinum.

13
00:02:54,979 --> 00:03:00,760
Now you may say, Sepia is the remedy
because it covers most of the symptoms.

14
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:09,896
But many times you say, no it is not Sepia.
 Why you say that? Because you have some information

15
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,083
from the Materia Medica which shows you that actually this case does not look like Sepia.

16
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:30,208
What do we mean by 'it does not look like Sepia'? That means we bring into the picture another factor,

17
00:03:30,313 --> 00:03:42,958
a new factor for analysing the case. We have the totality yes but the totality is only flat symptomatology

18
00:03:43,063 --> 00:03:54,333
which many times misleads us into a remedy which is not the correct remedy.

19
00:03:55,354 --> 00:04:10,781
So therefore you give up the strategy. I mean ok, Hahnemann said, take notice of the totality of the symptoms

20
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:21,073
but the totality has given me no solution
 to the case, what am I going to do?

21
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:29,406
I'm going to bring another element, another information which I have into the picture and see whether

22
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:41,896
the combination of this strategy with another strategy which is called the essences, whether the combination

23
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:59,813
of the two will give me the answer to this problem. And many times I find out that the essence

24
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:12,542
 fits actually with Phosphorus, not with Sepia, not with Natrum muriaticum. So inspite of the fact
 I have flat

25
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:22,052
symptomatology more for Sepia or Natrum muriaticum, I go and prescribe Phosphorus

26
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:34,625
because the patient has the picture of Phosphorus. You've done this consciously or unconsciously,

27
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:41,646
this is what you're doing in analysing a case.

28
00:05:41,750 --> 00:06:01,854
If we take for example, yesterday the child.
 If we had taken down the symptoms of the child,

29
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:18,802
we come down to Camomilla, to Cina, to different remedies.

30
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:33,469
What we did, you have no symptoms actually of Calcarea phosphorica. We said, wait a moment

31
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:50,354
that picture as it presents to me, the essence of this picture, the mental-emotional picture of this boy seems to be Calc-p.

32
00:06:50,458 --> 00:07:07,417
We ignore the majority of the totality and we prescribed on essence alone. In this case we prescribed on essence alone.

33
00:07:08,771 --> 00:07:22,531
Go back again to yesterday's case which we took the case of this nice girl and we said, the picture is Phosphorus.

34
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:33,188
If you have taken the totality of the symptoms, you would see it comes down to Phosphorus.

35
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:43,333
The essence it comes down to Phosphorus and that's why you will say with great certainty, the remedy

36
00:07:43,438 --> 00:07:52,094
which is going to cure this person, which covers both totality and essence, is Phosphorus.

37
00:07:52,198 --> 00:08:06,406
Then you have great confidence in this remedy because it covers the essence of Phosphorus and it covers the totality

38
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:17,365
for Phosphorus. Drinks a lot of water, empty feeling of the stomach, sleeps on the right side etc.

39
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:25,698
All that are flat symptoms which if you repertorize, they will come down to Phosphorus but also

40
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:35,792
she describes the sympathetic element the suffering because of the suffering of others etc. so strongly,

41
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:47,333
I say Phosphorus. Also the sudden collapse counts for Phosphorus. To you this is a beautiful case of Phosphorus.

42
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:59,802
-But then what do we need the
totality of the symptoms for?

43
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:20,625
-Maybe I did not make myself clear. I said
the totality will give you the remedy.

44
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:28,292
You do the totality it gives you the
 remedy, clearly, perfect you give it.

45
00:09:29,313 --> 00:09:37,740
There are cases in which this strategy will not give you a remedy. You will take all the symptoms

46
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:46,208
but no remedy is clear. In such cases, you
bring another factor which is the essence.

47
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:58,958
And you look from that point of view now. But still there are cases which are not going to be solved by either totality or essence.

48
00:09:59,063 --> 00:10:10,417
That means you have no clear essence and the totality fits in 10 different remedies. What are you going to do then?

49
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:28,177
This is the time that you will have to go by some keynotes, what we call keynotes.

50
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:51,854
What that means? It means that in the case of the boy that we saw, eventually the keynote which is very strong

51
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:58,042
for Medorrhinum, may lead us to prescribe Medorrhinum in the case.

52
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:05,313
Because the totality of the symptoms will not give us a clear picture, the essence is not there,

53
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:11,573
we have a strong keynote, we prescribe upon the strong keynote.

54
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:30,823
What I want to make clear to you is that you have to follow one strategy after the other. It is not a matter of,

55
00:11:30,927 --> 00:11:39,135
I prescribe on keynote, George is prescribing only on essences, only on this or that, no.

56
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:49,854
It is a matter of systematic thinking about the analysis of a case. The systematic thinking, you do your homework,

57
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:56,313
you do your repertorising, you think about it,
is this remedy, that remedy?

58
00:11:56,417 --> 00:12:05,375
It doesn't appear to me clear but that
case looks to me like Nux vomica.

59
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:23,521
But I have 5 symptoms of Nux vomica, ok take it. This is the idea. But sometimes the totality comes right through.

60
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:34,729
Or keynote symptoms of the remedy, ok give it. Forget the essence, forget everything else.

61
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:50,719
So you go down as a strategy and then you reach a point in some cases where no solution can be reached

62
00:12:50,823 --> 00:12:59,417
by the totality, essence and keynote. These are the cases you have prescribed several remedies.

63
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:12,427
There is another paragraph in Hahnemann.
He says, (par. 153) in which he gives...

64
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:27,917
ok totality and essence. About keynotes he writes in par. 153. He says, those symptoms have to be taken

65
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:38,667
 of much notice if they are strange, rare or peculiar. These are the keynotes.

66
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:50,208
These are what became meaning keynotes. Strange, rare and peculiar to this remedy. What are these?

67
00:13:50,313 --> 00:14:00,365
These are the things we're trying to give you in the Materia Medica. In the Materia Medica we try to combine

68
00:14:00,469 --> 00:14:11,365
the essence with keynotes, so we give you an information which is compact for each remedy and then

69
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:21,719
when you see it in the person, it will strike something in your mind. So here Hahnemann stresses the idea

70
00:14:21,823 --> 00:14:43,510
of taking notice, especially notice of keynotes.
But you see here in the child of bronchitis.

71
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:59,208
 The keynote is strange, rare and peculiar, is the Medorrhinum. But you have another impression

72
00:14:59,313 --> 00:15:03,448
about the child which gives you this remedy.

73
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:13,760
So as far as the essence is concerned, the disatisfaction, in the morning expressing this disatisfaction.

74
00:15:13,865 --> 00:15:31,031
You will see, if you progress more and more and you have more experience, you will see a difference

75
00:15:31,135 --> 00:15:41,427
between the disatisfaction of Chamomilla,
 the disatisfaction of Antimonium crudum,

76
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:49,250
the disatisfaction of Calcarea phosphorica the disatisfaction of Cina. You will see a difference which is

77
00:15:49,354 --> 00:16:07,667
very difficult even for me to define it. With Chamomilla there is an element of maliciousness.

78
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:35,563
The child has some malice and it is more aggressive. You try to put the stethoscope

79
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:46,292
and the Camomilla child will react in this way.

80
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:49,385
You are very nice. This is what we call the essence.

81
00:16:58,906 --> 00:17:08,083
You say, I did not see this. Disatisfaction and moaning.

82
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:33,781
Let's go out, Calcarea phosphorica. You walk
 out, you want out? No. This is different.

83
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:47,240
I mean you say one remedy and the other is disatisfaction but actually there are some differences.

84
00:17:50,333 --> 00:18:07,490
Cina does not have the moaning. It has the aggression and does not know what he wants.

85
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:21,552
Capriciousness. Give me this.
He takes this and throws it.

86
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:41,250
It is very interesting that we have live cases
 that you get the feeling of each remedy.

87
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:57,646
You see the element of aggressiveness grows then you go to another remedy. You see the element

88
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:07,979
of moaning you go to another remedy, you see the element of capriciousness, you go to another remedy.

89
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:17,313
But all these remedies are close together and difficult in their evaluation.

90
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:48,406
So from a practical point of view what you will have to do? I say that there are some cases in which you have given,

91
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,604
you prescribed on totality the Sepia, you prescribed the Natrum muriaticum, you went to Phosphorus,

92
00:19:53,708 --> 00:20:10,521
you went to Medorrhinum because of position, nothing. And then you find out that this case had an accident

93
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:28,333
 15 years ago where it was a big concussion on the brain, he had one or two symptoms of Arnica, you never thought of Arnica.

94
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:43,896
Because only 2 symptoms out of 20 but the causative factor is clear and you go to causation which may

95
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,115
require only one information that does not cover totality, does not cover essence.

96
00:20:52,219 --> 00:21:02,521
there are no keynotes but because you have the causation clear after this accident, then I started with my headaches.

97
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:12,208
The headaches do not have the picture of Arnica. The headaches may have the picture of Sepia

98
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:23,375
or a picture of Natrum muriaticum or a picture of Phosphorus. Yet Arnica is going to work.

99
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:43,292
You know the story with the peacock? The brain injury? The peacock who was raised back to life. Causation.

100
00:21:51,875 --> 00:22:03,604
A woman which becomes hysterical and has hysteria and her tongue turns, she is unconscious.

101
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:09,531
You give her Ignatia, she comes back to life.
You know all that.

102
00:22:16,313 --> 00:22:29,417
Here when we talk of essence, mostly we mean the mental-emotional picture, make-up.

103
00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:38,854
Then sometimes you go all along and you cannot really find the remedy inspite of the fact that you have gone

104
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:45,104
through all these strategies. Still you
cannot find the remedy.

105
00:22:46,333 --> 00:23:07,000
Then the fifth strategy is go to the essentials. Essentials is a very important strategy.

106
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:16,688
What are the essentials?

107
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:37,563
-I wanted to ask for this fourth point. You said, headaches for instance an accident but very often

108
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:51,469
 the headaches have a relation to some problem with the teeth. Do you ever think of teeth?

109
00:23:52,438 --> 00:24:02,448
-This is what I call causative factor.
 Causation is teeth.

110
00:24:02,552 --> 00:24:09,313
-No, I'm asking if you ever think that
there might be a problem with the teeth.

111
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:20,563
-No. I have heard that others have seen this, take out the teeth and there is an amelioration.

112
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:27,708
 I also have heard that a lot of people have
been taken out the teeth, no amelioration.

113
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:35,229
-If you take out all the teeth...
-Not all, only the teeth which are not ok.

114
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:43,927
I have done this because I'm a dentist,
and I found out there is a change.

115
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:55,031
-I have seen cases of trigeminal neuralgia for instance which all the teeth were taken out.

116
00:24:55,135 --> 00:25:04,490
No effect at all. And they come and tell the story of course. We hear actually the stories which are failures.

117
00:25:04,594 --> 00:25:12,854
 Because if there are success, we don't hear, they don't come to us.

118
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:22,448
They took my tooth out, they thought it was my tooth, they took 1,2,3 no effect. They took out all the teeth.

119
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:36,563
I remember at least 2 cases ,they took all the teeth out, no effect. So therefore they say, for instance,

120
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:47,188
 if you fill the teeth with amalgam, Mercury, it might have an effect. So you change the teeth into gold which

121
00:25:47,292 --> 00:26:01,292
I've seen some cases. But I have not seen this,
 I changed the teeth, no effect. But, as I said, we see the failures.

122
00:26:01,396 --> 00:26:13,292
I hear from journals, they have written it, that by doing this there was an effect and I believe it.

123
00:26:13,396 --> 00:26:21,719
But my experience is to see the failures. Who has failed and after that, he comes to be treated.

124
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:31,750
'I did this, I did that, no effect. Can you do something?'. And these are the cases which
 I have seen.

125
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:56,542
With this strategy here we have to go actually and see what are the essential features of the remedy.

126
00:26:56,646 --> 00:27:04,490
When I write the Materia Medica, there is a chapter in which I wrote the essential features.

127
00:27:04,594 --> 00:27:13,625
 In the essential features I don't describe only the essence but I describe, especially in the small remedies,

128
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:18,240
the combination of pathology.

129
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:54,438
That means somebody who is suffering with a lot of otitis and at the same time you see problems with gums.

130
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:12,958
Gums bleeding, receeding etc. Then the fact that we have a remedy which actually concentrates its action

131
00:28:13,063 --> 00:28:24,406
upon the ears and upon the gums, we can prescribe the remedy on these essential features of this remedy.

132
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:36,094
Which is the remedy? Mercury solubilis is the main remedy that you will think, inspite of the fact that

133
00:28:36,198 --> 00:28:47,469
 if you take the details of the symptoms, Mercury may not come down but given the fact that the combination

134
00:28:47,573 --> 00:28:57,219
 of pathology is for Mercury, then finally you prescribe Mercury and you see the effect.

135
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:28,729
I'll give another example. Hoarseness of voice together with an effect on the cartilaginous matter of the joint,

136
00:29:42,354 --> 00:29:47,625
Argentum metallicum.

137
00:29:57,438 --> 00:30:09,042
In this way you will solve many cases in which you try to find mental pathology. No mental pathology.

138
00:30:09,844 --> 00:30:17,354
You try to find the totality? No totality. The totality gives you several possibilities.

139
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:34,219
 No special keynotes. But the fact that the essential features, if you have eruptions and duodenal ulcer,

140
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:41,510
which are the remedies you will be thinking first?

141
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:52,177
Antimonium crudum, Graphites and
Kali bichromicum, Dulcamara...

142
00:30:52,906 --> 00:31:04,854
 Immediately the remedies come. You have cases that say, 'I have been bleeding from my stomach.

143
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:34,833
I've been in the hospital 5 times with bleeding of my ulcer'. And at the same time he gives you the information that is

144
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:59,771
 fatty degeneration of the liver.

145
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:25,906
The remedy that affects the liver and causes at the same time very easy haemmorhages, is Phosphorus.

146
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:44,729
So the fact that you have a pathology you
just concentrate on the main pathology.

147
00:32:45,750 --> 00:33:04,938
You have somebody who is having swollen glands, cervical glands, some maxiliary, inguinal glands swollen

148
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:27,313
and if they will tell you that such a person has also hypothyroidism, the thyroid is slow and the person is getting obese,

149
00:33:27,417 --> 00:33:32,104
the remedy that you will be thinking is?

150
00:33:40,135 --> 00:33:56,073
No. Calcarea carbonica. Getting fat, hypothyroidism with glands swollen.

151
00:33:56,177 --> 00:34:18,865
If the glands are swollen, again hard swollen and the next pathology is diziness, vertigo, you see, Conium. This is the idea.

152
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:33,604
Then it becomes very important that your mind should think this way and ignore sometimes the totality

153
00:34:33,708 --> 00:34:50,542
which will give you Sepia because the essentials are for Conium. And you need the information on the essentials

154
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:59,552
 because we don't have the information for all the remedies about mental-emotional, what they can cause.

155
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:07,854
We don't have it. In all the remedies it would
 be nice to have, it would be nice to know

156
00:35:07,958 --> 00:35:17,333
the peculiarities on the mental-emotional
level of Cajuputum. We don't.

157
00:35:21,792 --> 00:35:30,625
There is such a remedy? Cajuputum?
 No. I made it up.

158
00:35:58,125 --> 00:36:09,437
They have a very peculiar symptom where the tongue feels so big that fills the whole mouth.

159
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:35,469
I'm not joking. There is such a remedy, there is such symptom which has tremendous anxiety about health.

160
00:37:02,198 --> 00:37:08,823
So you will see whether you want it or not, whether you do it consciously or not consciously

161
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:17,958
that in your evaluation in Classical Homeopathy, you follow this line of thinking.

162
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,688
The first thing you are looking for is the totality of the symptoms. Then you go to the Repertory, you go to the computer

163
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:32,698
and try to see which is the remedy and
then you see some things on the essence.

164
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:47,729
Then the keynotes come to correct. Therefore many times your decision will be based upon the combination of these strategies.

165
00:37:48,875 --> 00:38:04,333
Some totality, rather the essence but it has one or two keynotes of this and the causation also it fits, perfect.

166
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:40,313
I will just give you a few things. In order to do this essence, you need observation. This is not going to be given

167
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:50,750
by the patient himself. You need some observation many times to come down to the essence.

168
00:38:51,688 --> 00:39:01,469
The keynotes are given by the patient himself. The causative factor is easy if you go to the anamnesis.

169
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:11,854
The essentials is for you to clarify everything else, to trigger out and say, wait a moment.

170
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:23,448
The essentials here are these. What is happening with this organism is his stomach and his skin,

171
00:39:23,552 --> 00:39:27,177
stomach and skin are affected.

172
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:40,177
I will give you an example going to Phosphorus again since we're studying the Phosphorus case.

173
00:39:40,281 --> 00:39:59,271
 I will give you an example of Phosphorus child.
It was a child of a couple of medical doctors who were studying

174
00:39:59,375 --> 00:40:16,698
 with me 20 years ago. They have a little daughter, she fell ill and she was prescribed several remedies, no effect.

175
00:40:18,906 --> 00:40:29,917
And the pediatrician was called. He diagnosed encephalomyelitis and the child had high fever,

176
00:40:30,021 --> 00:40:40,604
she had the stiffness in the neck and it was taken to hospital. By the time it was in the hospital,

177
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:49,583
 they telephone me; they say well this is happening, the child is with encephalomyelitis

178
00:40:52,260 --> 00:41:03,563
and would I come to see the child. I came to see the child and she had the typical symptoms of encephalomyelitis

179
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:48,938
and she was conscious but in semi-stupor.
Then the mother who described the case to me,

180
00:41:49,042 --> 00:42:03,781
 she gave me the symptoms, fever and pathological symptoms, I couldn't make nothing.

181
00:42:03,885 --> 00:42:14,271
She described to me how this child was very courageous because she was punctured many times,

182
00:42:14,375 --> 00:42:25,156
the doctors came to take blood, she wouldn't react at all, very courageous child.

183
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:41,156
I said, courageous? You see in my mind, it's a very strenuous time, you have to think fast because the child

184
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:50,646
is with fever there, what is going to do cortisone or no cortisone? You have to make very fast decisions.

185
00:42:51,104 --> 00:43:05,667
And the mother, as I said, gave me no symptoms apart from the child being courageous. In my mind it didn't fit.

186
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:17,094
A child when it's punctured usually cries. And many times they took blood to examine,

187
00:43:17,198 --> 00:43:39,240
puncture to get cerebral fluid and the
 child didn't react at all. Very strange.

188
00:43:39,979 --> 00:43:58,854
In the meantime the mother was sitting in the bed, holding the hand of the child. I said to the mother,

189
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:10,844
take out your hand from the child. The child
was in semi-stupor. She takes it away.

190
00:44:17,135 --> 00:44:31,073
I said, hold again. She holds, she stops.
I said, take it out again. Hold again, stops.

191
00:44:31,177 --> 00:44:42,698
Very good. I said, when do you want to be well, tonight or tomorrow? She was crying, are you joking?

192
00:44:42,802 --> 00:44:59,292
 No, I'm serious. Tonight or tomorrow? She said, it doesn't matter. I said, ok give her Phosphorus 10M.

193
00:45:00,771 --> 00:45:18,448
Why? Because the child had such anxiety, such fear that the fear paralysed her and she could not react to the punctures.

194
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:30,188
The fear and the anxiety was so much that the puncture was not felt anymore and the desire for company

195
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:41,313
was so strong, that she wanted the
mother to hold her hand to feel secure.

196
00:45:41,417 --> 00:45:53,375
These two symptoms, the anxiety and the desire to be held was so strong that it was pointing to Phosphorus.

197
00:45:54,771 --> 00:46:04,438
This is observation for the essence of the case.
So they gave Phosphorus about 11 o'clock in the morning,

198
00:46:04,542 --> 00:46:13,448
Phosphorus 10M. In the evening I said, call me in the evening to tell me how she is. In the evening the father calls.

199
00:46:13,552 --> 00:46:29,802
He is also a Homeopath. He said, you know what? Do you know what she asked to eat?

200
00:46:29,906 --> 00:46:43,292
The child had not eaten for 2 days. What did she ask to eat? Ice-cream. I said, go and buy her and give her ice-cream.

201
00:46:44,292 --> 00:47:01,073
Next day by 11 o'clock again the fever was taking 39,5 high. They telephone, there is a relapse.
I said, 50M.

202
00:47:01,177 --> 00:47:17,229
Give 50M. In the evening the child was well. The child has taken a lot of other remedies, don't forget, without effect, why?

203
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:26,896
Because the totality etc. What was missing? The mother was missing the whole picture of the child;

204
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:41,083
that the child was very anxious about her health.
She was hearing all kinds of activity, doctors. I'm dying.

205
00:47:42,104 --> 00:47:51,438
They have such strong anxiety about their health, the Phosphorus cases, they are paralysed from fear.

206
00:47:52,198 --> 00:47:59,250
And the child was under this condition.
So you are learning.

207
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:13,031
-I have not really understood the difference between essences and keynotes. The symptoms in the Phos case

208
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:19,469
were they essence symptoms or were they keynotes?

209
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:46,313
-Essence is referred mostly to mental-emotional picture in general. The mental-emotional make up

210
00:48:46,417 --> 00:48:58,698
of the person in each pathology what it is? To be anxious with this kind of anxiety or that kind of anxiety,

211
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:04,563
 to be irritable, to be aggressive, to be this or that. This is the essence.

212
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:15,292
Keynotes are symptoms, they can be mental, emotional also but physical as well.

213
00:49:15,396 --> 00:49:26,896
Symptoms that this remedy has in particular. That means when you go to the Repertory and you look,

214
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:40,542
 urination like yogurt, it comes out pieces of white matter, Phosphoric acid only.

215
00:49:41,292 --> 00:49:50,333
This is the keynote for Phosphoric acid. So the person tells you he urinates this yogurt, you go to the Repertory

216
00:49:50,438 --> 00:50:03,333
you see only Phosphoric acid, you better take it.
The keynote is when the child says, sleeps on knee-elbow position.

217
00:50:03,438 --> 00:50:11,104
 We used to have only one remedy Medorrhinum. Now we have some other remedies

218
00:50:11,208 --> 00:50:18,823
also that we know they're sleeping in that position. And still I believe there are some more because

219
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:28,906
 a lot of children are sleeping in that position. Not all of them are Medorrhinum but this is a keynote of Medorrhinum.

220
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:59,135
If the person cannot eat oyster, then is Phosphorus. It is a keynote for Phosphorus.

221
00:51:10,354 --> 00:51:39,208
Let us define the keynotes more. A keynote is a strange, rare and peculiar or we need some more definition?

222
00:51:44,177 --> 00:51:58,031
I will give you a strange, rare and peculiar. Anytime that somebody goes downstairs he has drops of urine coming out,

223
00:51:58,135 --> 00:52:07,490
involuntary drops of urine. Try to find this.

224
00:52:09,802 --> 00:52:24,979
This is a keynote mostly for Pulsatilla. Pulsatilla does not want to come out, she is very shy.

225
00:52:27,042 --> 00:52:38,938
You see a few remedies are there. We have 2,3,4,6 remedies and one remedy is strong for that symptom,

226
00:52:39,042 --> 00:52:58,552
peculiar symptom, then we say that Pulsatilla has a keynote which is involuntary urination while sitting.

227
00:53:02,375 --> 00:53:11,208
It is not Causticum which you would expect because of paralyis of the bladder. It is Pulsatilla.

228
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:26,083
But involuntary urination while going downstairs, you search and search in all your Materia Medica and you cannot find.

229
00:53:27,573 --> 00:53:36,813
Therefore in order to have a definition of the keynote you need to have the strange, rare and peculiar

230
00:53:36,917 --> 00:53:49,469
plus that this symptom has been recorded in the provings. Otherwise you may have beautiful

231
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:58,271
strange, rare and peculiar symptoms and you cannot use them. Because they are not recorded in the Materia Medica,

232
00:53:58,375 --> 00:54:04,625
not recorded in the Repertory and you
cannot find them and they are useless.

233
00:54:05,927 --> 00:54:16,938
So the keynotes usually with which we work, have to have this element: strange, rare and peculiar and also

234
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:28,333
to be recorded in the Materia Medica and the Repertory as peculiar symptoms of very few or only one remedy.

235
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:45,583
So this is the definition of keynote. They have to be recorded by few remedies; few remedies will have that

236
00:54:45,688 --> 00:54:54,333
because maybe what you think as strange, rare and peculiar, you go to the Repertory and this strange, rare and peculiar,

237
00:54:54,438 --> 00:55:12,313
you see it has been recorded it has been produced by 100 remedies. It's not rare, so it is not a keynote

238
00:55:12,417 --> 00:55:18,417
 inspite of the fact it looks very strange to you.

239
00:55:19,469 --> 00:55:27,625
In the Materia Medica is recorded by too many remedies; it's not a keynote.

240
00:55:28,542 --> 00:55:54,052
Try to find malicious. You see, 150 remedies.
 You think a person is malicious, very strange, rare and peculiar.

241
00:55:54,156 --> 00:56:22,604
It is not. It is disappointing to see the picture of humanity in this rubric. God help us. Malicious.

242
00:56:22,708 --> 00:56:32,469
Who is not malicious? So this is not strange, rare and peculiar. It's a common symptom.

243
00:56:36,552 --> 00:56:54,573
Anac., Ars., Nat-m, Nux-v., Stram., where is Sepia, it's not there? Forget it.

244
00:56:57,198 --> 00:57:01,885
Sepia in small.

245
00:57:16,198 --> 00:57:59,813
Staph., Phos., Tub., Lach. should go higher to the third degree, Sep should go to the second degree.

246
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:10,875
But anyhow the maliciousness in each of these remedies has a color. It is different from one remedy to the other.

247
00:58:10,979 --> 00:58:26,177
The maliciousness of Arsenicum is not the same as Stramonium. And the maliciousness of Tub is not the same as Sepia.

248
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:32,917
Each one has its own color.

249
00:58:53,844 --> 00:59:17,531
 It's very strange, rare and peculiar that a patient will tell you he is malicious. I've not heard it so far by any patient.

250
00:59:20,573 --> 00:59:31,823
-So the keynote for the Pulsatilla here is for the case before and it's for five others.

251
00:59:31,927 --> 00:59:45,521
-But Pulsatilla is only capital. Pulsatilla is sticking out and there are a few others. So, if the symptom is really strong,

252
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:53,906
then the first thing you are thinking is Pulsatilla.
So in your analysis there you have that symptom.

253
00:59:54,417 --> 01:00:09,646
 Let us say, you have here a case, where between other symptoms you have involuntary urination while sitting.

254
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:26,510
And Pulsatilla in the analysis here, comes with 6 symptoms. But with a strong keynote like this, you better prescribe Puls.

255
01:00:35,885 --> 01:00:46,063
-If you have keynotes which are very specific for a certain remedy, are they then automatically in
 the 3rd degree in the Repertory?

256
01:00:59,552 --> 01:01:11,667
-No. There are keynotes which can be in the
 first degree. What it means third degree?

257
01:01:11,771 --> 01:01:22,240
Third degree in the Repertory has to do
 with frequency and intensity in the provers.

258
01:01:23,198 --> 01:01:35,667
And frequency and intensity in the patient as a clinical observation. That means a lot of provers have said,

259
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:49,229
 clearly I have that symptom. That symptom goes and is registered as capital. If no other remedy has that symptom,

260
01:01:49,333 --> 01:02:01,229
then it becomes a very important symptom.
If other remedies have been recorded but not so strongly,

261
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:08,188
then they will show other remedies there but
 first or second degree, not capital.

262
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:21,292
But in the proving of a remedy where a lot of provers have said, yes while sitting I have loss urine,

263
01:02:21,396 --> 01:02:27,802
then it becomes a strong symptom and it is recorded in the third degree in the Repertory.

264
01:02:27,906 --> 01:02:39,438
Actually the recording on the Repertory is a matter of evaluating the information from the provers

265
01:02:39,542 --> 01:02:45,875
and also evaluating finally that
information from the patients.

266
01:02:45,979 --> 01:03:01,031
How many Pulsatilla patients are suffering with heat? A lot. It becomes strong, capital letter.

267
01:03:01,135 --> 01:03:08,427
Pulsatilla, worse heat. How many Pulsatilla patients are ameliorated in the open air?

268
01:03:08,531 --> 01:03:23,917
A lot. 80% of them. Capital. How many patients are losing urine while sitting from the Pulsatilla patients?

269
01:03:24,906 --> 01:03:37,427
Not a lot but because this is a strange, rare and peculiar symptom and it is recorded out of 100 Pulsatillas,

270
01:03:37,531 --> 01:03:45,594
it is recorded in 10,12 cases, then
 it becomes a strong keynote.

271
01:03:53,021 --> 01:04:08,979
-George I'm utterly confused because before you said, the essences are recorded by observation

272
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:15,760
and the keynotes by the patient. And after you said, the rare, strange and peculiar with the example

273
01:04:15,865 --> 01:04:25,750
of malicious will not probably be said
by the patient, so there is a distinction.

274
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:37,073
-No. I said, strange, rare and peculiar it seems to be the malicious. Yet it is not strange, rare and peculiar.

275
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:52,823
It is common to many remedies. That's one.
And in this case we were not taking about a keynote.

276
01:04:57,771 --> 01:05:06,979
Usually the keynotes are recorded by the patient but we said, we have three sources of information.

277
01:05:07,219 --> 01:05:22,719
The patient, the relatives, the physician. So the essence usually it is an observation of the physician,

278
01:05:22,823 --> 01:05:39,906
an observation of the relatives, of others. The person himself, for instance Nux vomica is very irritable.

279
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:51,854
I just give you an example. I was examining a professor of surgery with severe, chronic headaches.

280
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:59,583
And I had next to me George Papaphilippou who is a surgeon but he is a Homeopath now.

281
01:05:59,688 --> 01:06:10,719
He studied with him, he was in the operation table with this professor. He brought me his professor to look at him.

282
01:06:10,823 --> 01:06:22,688
 I see a very nice professor who sits very calm. He is very obese, very calm and very nice.

283
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:37,417
He gives me symptoms of the headaches only and I cannot make out anything. I try this and that, no, normal...

284
01:06:40,823 --> 01:06:50,729
But I get finally the idea, maybe this is a
Nux vomica case. But he looks so calm.

285
01:06:50,813 --> 01:06:58,104
So I put the question to him, are you
irritable? He said, no.

286
01:06:58,208 --> 01:07:16,563
And then George underneath kicks me. You got it. I said, what I mean is you don't shout, he never shouted

287
01:07:16,667 --> 01:07:25,250
but inside him if somebody was giving
him the wrong tool, immediately ....

288
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:35,104
But the others would notice it. So George working with him had notice that actually was very angry and very irritable.

289
01:07:35,208 --> 01:07:42,646
He, himself said no because he did not express his anger, he did not express his irritability.

290
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:56,396
So on that information I prescribed Nux vomica and the headaches were beautifully cured.

291
01:07:59,958 --> 01:08:08,542
-This is a question about theory. Let's say you have a case where the totality of the symptoms leads you

292
01:08:08,646 --> 01:08:21,750
to a clear remedy but the essence is in contradiction, is this a possible case and what do you do?

293
01:08:22,531 --> 01:08:33,437
-You give the totality first. It fails, then you
go as a second idea to the essence.

294
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:44,854
Essence is something that comes from experience and it is very difficult to be transferred.

295
01:08:44,958 --> 01:08:53,260
I transfer you an impression. I'm not sure that always I transfer the right impression, correct?

296
01:08:53,750 --> 01:09:02,406
So when you see the real thing, I say this is Ambra grisea you say 'I thought this'. That's why
I say,

297
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:09,156
first totality, if you have clear totality
 you give it. Then you go to essence.

298
01:09:10,625 --> 01:09:25,958
Essentials is more easy. Facts. Essence I'm describing the soul, something intangible.

299
01:09:28,437 --> 01:09:36,333
My experience, not your experience yet; until you see the real case, you prescribe the remedy.

300
01:09:36,437 --> 01:09:46,740
I receive letters from students saying, it was great I gave a dose of Agaricus and it acted beautifully on essence.

301
01:09:48,260 --> 01:10:02,042
That person means he got the essence. But I'm not sure everybody is getting the essence really from what I say.

302
01:10:02,917 --> 01:10:08,208
- Would you take the essence?

303
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:23,333
-Leave my case out because I will take what experience has shown me I should take at the moment.

304
01:10:27,219 --> 01:10:42,875
Not always also. I will read to you a case in London. I was in London and I was presented a case

305
01:10:42,979 --> 01:10:49,490
without any essence, without any general symptoms, only some pathology.

306
01:10:50,802 --> 01:11:00,688
I prescribed on pathology, I prescribed on the essentials, what I feel he had the essential features of that remedy.

307
01:11:03,573 --> 01:11:10,031
In September we talked about when a patient receives a remedy which is not the correct one, that he then

308
01:11:10,135 --> 01:11:19,229
develops proving symptoms. That means he has these proving symptoms plus his own symptoms.

309
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:25,271
 And you said, if we then repertorise again we must not take the new symptoms he has developed into

310
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:32,250
consideration. But in the Organon, Hahnemann says, one should include the new symptoms

311
01:11:32,354 --> 01:11:37,396
in the repertorisation when one
looks for a new remedy.

312
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:50,698
-First of all not every time that you give a wrong remedy you have provings of this remedy, that's one.

313
01:11:50,802 --> 01:11:58,000
Because you gave the impression that I have said, every time you give a wrong remedy there is proving.

314
01:11:58,104 --> 01:12:17,938
In some cases you will have proving symptoms of the remedy you gave plus the symptoms of the patient.

315
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:27,073
And I say, in such a case you go back to the original case restudy and give another remedy.

316
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:38,604
This is different than you give a remedy and the remedy is not the correct or we don't know yet if it is the correct or not

317
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:52,135
and changes some of the symptoms of the case without curing the case. That is a different case in which

318
01:12:52,240 --> 01:13:03,885
you have now to take the new symptoms which have developed, into consideration. And only them.

319
01:13:05,104 --> 01:13:08,573
You see the difference?
-No.

320
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:40,229
-You have a case and it has these symptoms. And you give a wrong remedy but it produces certain symptoms

321
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:55,052
of the remedy you gave. These are the new symptoms it produces without changing this.

322
01:13:55,156 --> 01:14:08,125
What you have to do in such a case is that you go back to the original case and try to find another remedy that fits that picture.

323
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:23,802
We go now to another case, number 2. Where you have the same picture and you gave a remedy

324
01:14:23,906 --> 01:14:36,396
that has not cured the case but has
changed the case, how? Like this.

325
01:14:51,667 --> 01:15:04,073
It has changed the case to this. He even has a symptom which is more bothering now, more strong

326
01:15:04,177 --> 01:15:09,417
but some of the other symptoms have disappeared, some have changed.

327
01:15:10,531 --> 01:15:45,802
Now in such a case you have to study this picture, and give a second remedy.

328
01:15:49,417 --> 01:15:54,375
Here is another remedy.

329
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:09,240
You give this remedy you ignore this part and you go back to the original case, you study and you give another remedy.

330
01:16:17,583 --> 01:16:27,312
-I have another question concering this. Some people give like 7C every day and then

331
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:37,802
even if you give the right remedy after a while the patient starts taking out new symptoms of this remedy

332
01:16:37,906 --> 01:16:47,896
you gave him. Then sometimes you get a bit mixed up because you don't know if it was ok,

333
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,063
 if it was a proving, I want to be clear in that.

334
01:16:53,083 --> 01:17:06,781
-I'm also mixed up with the question.
Forget the paragraph. The example.

335
01:17:06,885 --> 01:17:15,250
-A person comes to the Homeopath. He decides that he has to give him every day 9C of a certain remedy.

336
01:17:15,354 --> 01:17:16,625
-Wrong remedy?

337
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:23,479
-No, right remedy. That's the treatment he wants him to take. The first month everything is fine.

338
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:35,646
The second month everything is fine and then suddenly he starts taking out symptoms of this remedy like a proving.

339
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:46,781
-Yes it is correct. This is going to happen. If you continue inspite of the fact that the person is well,

340
01:17:46,885 --> 01:17:52,354
you continue to give every day the same remedy, you are going to cause some proving.

341
01:17:52,458 --> 01:18:00,417
So eventually this person is going to develop symptoms of the remedy you are repeating.
 Not always.

342
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:10,896
There are many cases where you repeat with no effect. But some cases where there is some sensitivity there,

343
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:17,271
definitely you are going to see
symptoms of the remedy appearing.

344
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:29,719
-So that means if I understood you correctly, the second example that you drew on the board, is in cases where

345
01:18:29,823 --> 01:18:38,531
I give similar remedy but not the most similar, similar but not similimum, correct?

346
01:18:39,573 --> 01:19:01,531
-Not only that. But if she goes on with this logic, it's going to go wrong. Let me clarify this situation here, what happens.

347
01:19:03,375 --> 01:19:17,438
A remedy has changed the picture. The original picture has changed by a remedy. That does not mean that the remedy is incorrect.

348
01:19:18,198 --> 01:19:31,229
It means that this case needs a series of remedies. One, two, three, perhaps four remedies.

349
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:41,792
In such a case you have changes all
along as the person goes towards cure.

350
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:19,188
-One question about the first case. If there are proving symptoms, that means that the patient is sensitive?

351
01:20:19,292 --> 01:20:30,760
-That means it is close. That is unfortunate. What happened here is not good. It is unfortunate.

352
01:20:30,865 --> 01:20:38,333
What is happening here is correct.
There is no other way.

353
01:20:39,354 --> 01:20:51,490
-Yes but I think if he is sensitive there would be a change. If there are other symptoms, if the symptoms

354
01:20:51,594 --> 01:21:03,646
have changed, the disease has changed or the answer has perhaps changed too. It might be better

355
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:08,604
to wait until the proving symptoms disappear.

356
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:23,094
-This is even better. If you can't wait, it depends on the case, if it is urgent case, you have to give something.

357
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:30,125
If it is not urgent then the best is to wait
and the proving symptoms will subside.

358
01:21:30,906 --> 01:21:55,354
And it is good also in such a case if either you allow coffee to drink or if it is something urgent you treat it allopathically.

359
01:21:57,500 --> 01:22:10,104
The allopathic medication will bring you back to the original case. As long as it's not too heavy.

360
01:22:16,021 --> 01:22:25,385
Allopathically of course you can cause damage quite a lot but in such case where we fail.

361
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:37,688
This is what happens actually naturally. The doctor will say, you are not responding to homeopathic remedies.

362
01:22:37,792 --> 01:22:48,521
It's a nice way to say 'I failed to find the remedy. Your organism is not responding to homeopathic remedies'

363
01:22:48,625 --> 01:22:58,823
it's a good excuse, if you want that excuse you can use it. But for yourself you have to know the fact.

364
01:22:58,927 --> 01:23:11,604
 Therefore take some pain killers or whatever. Try to avoid cortisone as much as possible.

365
01:23:11,708 --> 01:23:21,198
Cortisone is such a deep drug that can change the whole picture and can leave you without symptoms.

366
01:23:23,042 --> 01:23:30,719
Then we'll see afterwards what we can do. Then the original case returns and then you restudy the case

367
01:23:30,823 --> 01:23:34,375
and you see the original and then you give it.

368
01:23:35,177 --> 01:23:44,313
Hahnemann was not facing such problems as we did and we do. What they used to do is put leeches

369
01:23:44,417 --> 01:23:55,427
to draw blood and to put cataplasms and superficial things that did not change the

370
01:23:55,531 --> 01:24:01,531
 organism in a deep manner as the
 drugs that we have today.

371
01:24:02,313 --> 01:24:10,406
So his observations are according to his experience of course. These observations are from our experience.

372
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:21,135
In Hahnemann's time they did not have so weakened constitutions that we have today

373
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:29,292
that need a series of remedies
 before they can just survive.

374
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:50,094
-I wish to ask you something practical.
I had a patient who came to me because of hypothyroidism

375
01:24:53,490 --> 01:25:02,865
and I gave her Medorrhinum and she felt much better. But nothing changed about hypothyroidism

376
01:25:03,469 --> 01:25:23,490
 and she needed more and more thyroxine till 150. I thought that maybe it can be Causticum.

377
01:25:23,594 --> 01:25:36,229
 I give her Causticum and this time she developed Causticum symptoms and the internist told her

378
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:52,104
that the doses of thyroxine is too high. Then he needed to put it down and I wish to ask you what happened here.

379
01:25:52,208 --> 01:26:06,885
I thought Causticum was the right remedy, the thyroid gland began to work and the doses of thyroxine were too high.

380
01:26:09,469 --> 01:26:18,062
-Let me understand. The thyroxine which was given by the internist was too high after Causticum

381
01:26:18,167 --> 01:26:29,490
 and then she had to reduce the dose. That is correct. That means Causticum was helping the patient produce

382
01:26:29,594 --> 01:26:42,052
more thyroxine herself and she needed less from outside. That means Causticum was acting curatively in this case.

383
01:26:42,156 --> 01:26:56,979
-They were really Causticum symptoms.
 It was like proving of Causticum.

384
01:26:58,708 --> 01:27:14,406
-We have said in the first session, that when we give a remedy and the remedy acts curatively that means

385
01:27:14,510 --> 01:27:25,000
improves the general state of the patient and at the same time produces some of its own symptoms,

386
01:27:25,104 --> 01:27:31,021
that is a proof that the remedy is correct.

387
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:44,531
If the remedy does not change anything  here and produces some of its own symptoms, then we have a proving.

388
01:27:46,438 --> 01:27:59,490
When the remedy changes 1 or 2 symptoms without bringing any essential change in the state,

389
01:27:59,594 --> 01:28:08,573
we have again a proving with a remedy
 that was very close to the case.

390
01:28:08,833 --> 01:28:18,115
In such cases, this and that, where we have given a close remedy, we have to wait

391
01:28:18,219 --> 01:28:24,219
until this is the right answer, we have to wait
 until the proving symptoms are gone.

392
01:28:28,135 --> 01:28:33,292
-Another question to the proving symptoms,
 your first example on the board.

393
01:28:34,292 --> 01:28:39,958
When the patient suddenly develops diarrhea,
 is also a proving symptom?

394
01:29:02,938 --> 01:29:09,729
-You give a remedy and he gets diarrhea.

395
01:29:10,490 --> 01:29:16,396
-Most probably diarrhea is because
he ate something wrong. -No.

396
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:33,771
-What about the discharge reactions after taking a remedy? Are they also part of proving or not?

397
01:29:34,542 --> 01:29:40,521
-Discharge from the vagina, leukorrhea. You give a remedy and you have discharge from the vagina

398
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:50,219
or discharge from the nose. This is a good symptom, a curative symptom. It's not a proving.

399
01:29:52,313 --> 01:29:59,240
-Does it mean all discharges are good symptoms and are a proof of a curative effect?

400
01:30:01,375 --> 01:30:17,083
-The reaction of an organism is taken as a whole. What you evaluate is the total reaction of the patient.

401
01:30:17,698 --> 01:30:26,156
If the total reaction says, this person is going towards cure because he is better, better

402
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:37,854
and he has some diarrhea, diarrhea is good.
Discharge from the nose is good. Discharge
 from the skin is good.

403
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:50,313
 But if you say, the person is getting worse,
he has diarrhea, he has blood in the stool,

404
01:30:50,417 --> 01:31:00,646
you give a remedy and the blood is coming out
then that is an aggravation which most probably is the wrong remedy.

405
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:14,042
 You cannot say in general discharges are good.
Depending on the whole attitude of the case.

406
01:31:16,469 --> 01:31:23,823
 The child we say, the remedy is correct
because it shows an improvement.

407
01:31:23,927 --> 01:31:35,115
Has the child become well with this remedy? No. It shows an improvement, mental-emotional, in the fever,

408
01:31:35,219 --> 01:31:40,146
 in the appetite but still needs a second remedy.

409
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:49,438
What is the second remedy? We study the new symptoms and then we prescribe the new remedy.

410
01:31:55,510 --> 01:32:01,135
-I had a similar problem. I had a manager who was in a very high position and was really worn out,

411
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:15,052
he was close to a heart attack. He was really washed out. He came and I took his case and then I gave him Pulsatilla.

412
01:32:15,156 --> 01:32:25,313
Then after 4-5 months when he felt really relieved and beautifully to look at and really relaxed,

413
01:32:25,417 --> 01:32:38,521
he came back. He had little problem with rhythm but this was small, it was solved with allopathic drug very easily.

414
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,854
When he came back he said he has serious problems with the people he worked for, because

415
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:54,646
he was not interested in this work anymore.
 He was 57 and he had 3 years to go.

416
01:32:54,750 --> 01:33:03,771
Then what could I say? Shoud I say drink
 coffee or stop the job. I said, stop the job.

417
01:33:05,375 --> 01:33:14,854
-No, neither. You encourage this person.
 I mean 57 he works for 40 years most probably.

418
01:33:14,958 --> 01:33:23,396
If he works for another 3 years is not such a big deal. I would say, I encourage him to work.

419
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:37,917
I have swear that I'm going to stop teaching, working a long time ago. I had enough, exausted,

420
01:33:38,021 --> 01:33:50,427
 I go back home, my wife says, 'why you kill yourself'. And then I say, ok let's see another 3 more years and I'm 65.

421
01:33:50,531 --> 01:33:56,469
-It's because you love your job.
-I'm not sure.

422
01:34:08,865 --> 01:34:15,271
-I still am not clear about this case from Marion because the Causticum improved the case

423
01:34:15,375 --> 01:34:22,760
so the thyroid is working better. But what if the woman develops Causticum symptoms.

424
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:33,427
He said, she developed Causticum symptoms and now she has involuntary urination for example.

425
01:34:33,531 --> 01:34:41,000
If the Causticum is working but produces
 really very bad symptoms?

426
01:34:46,708 --> 01:34:54,667
-Of course this question is because we have not completed the theory in Homeopathy and we shall be completing it.

427
01:34:54,771 --> 01:35:05,271
I want to give you another idea. Talking in hypothetical cases is very difficult for me to answer

428
01:35:05,375 --> 01:35:12,104
 because I have to know all the parameters before I can answer specific question to specific cases.

429
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:25,646
But as a general rule, I want to tell you this. You start treatment with a child who is quite disturbed mentally

430
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:37,875
and the parents come. It is restless, it has that symptom etc. They complain of undefined symptoms,

431
01:35:37,979 --> 01:35:47,781
you can't say the child is really mentally ill.
But it's not really balanced in mental-emotional level.

432
01:35:47,885 --> 01:35:54,365
And you start a treatment with such a child.
This child you are going to have a lot of problems

433
01:35:54,469 --> 01:36:07,854
as you improve his health. With what? With acute conditions mostly and chronic conditions on the physical level.

434
01:36:08,219 --> 01:36:18,094
As you improve the mental-emotional level then the child starts getting colds easily, getting this, that,

435
01:36:20,208 --> 01:36:33,771
pains in the stomach, in the guts, then you really have a problem. You cannot say these problems are

436
01:36:33,875 --> 01:36:43,906
 because of the proving of the remedy. It's because of the improvement of the organism which comes on another level.

437
01:36:44,625 --> 01:36:50,604
It goes away the disturbance from the mental-emotional and comes to the physical.

438
01:36:50,708 --> 01:37:01,271
The organism does not have the possibility to bring it straight to the skin and then it battles within the physical body.

439
01:37:01,375 --> 01:37:11,385
And then you will get a lot of problems with such children. But once you bring them alone, when they grow up

440
01:37:11,490 --> 01:37:29,438
and they become strong and you really feel that you have done something finally. But all along you have a lot of problems.

441
01:37:29,542 --> 01:37:37,854
So if you give me a specific case, bring me the whole case, give me all the details and then

442
01:37:37,958 --> 01:37:42,698
I will give you the answer,
whether this is this or that.
