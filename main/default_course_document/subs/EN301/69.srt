1
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:33,740
We're talking today about the meaning
of homeopathic consultation.

2
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:49,510
We're going to talk about
preparation of the Homeopath.

3
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:19,520
I will just give you some basic ideas which have come out of my experience.

4
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:51,840
What does it mean that an individual decides to go to a doctor and in particular to a Homeopath? What it means?

5
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:26,490
First of all it means that the individual is suffering; that's why he decides to go to see a doctor, to see a Homeopath.

6
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:39,380
And what is your position? Your position is that you come to me and I will cure you.

7
00:02:45,240 --> 00:03:00,300
So here we have a phenomenon which has two faces. One outside face where the person appears and you are there

8
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:17,570
sitting in your room and an inner phenomenon which is the expectation of the patient that he will be well

9
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:31,330
and your expectation that you will give him health.

10
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:47,050
Actually this meeting has a necessity for a double preparation. An outside preparation and an inside, inner preparation.

11
00:03:49,090 --> 00:04:07,660
The outside preparation is that you went to a school, you learned certain methods and then after you felt good and secure,

12
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:30,340
you open a clinic or a practice and you got nice furniture, the best possible furniture and a nice atmosphere

13
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:42,870
so when the patient comes, feels that he is comfortable and that you are a very important person.

14
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:51,460
Because you have a big throne on which you
are sitting and this can impress the patient.

15
00:04:51,560 --> 00:05:05,340
So there is actually in everyone who is doing this an outside preparation, as I say, starting from the day where

16
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:18,360
they decide to learn this method and the preparation, the main thing of it ends when he has opened his office

17
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:31,350
and he has furniture and things like that. These are important things but what matters in that whole preparation?

18
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,150
It mattters how much study you put on it,
from the very beginning.

19
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:58,480
One wants to study, one says one more, one less. So it matters how much preparation you are doing really

20
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:11,820
in order to meet the challenge. What is the challenge? The challenge is something which is actually

21
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:30,270
so beyond to your human capacity that you can say it does not matter how much preparation I may have, still I may fail.

22
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:42,090
You know all that. In Medicine is not so strong this. You don't need this because you know that in an duodenal ulcer

23
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:52,820
you will give an anti-acid drug, you will give this and that, even your nurse knows what to give.

24
00:06:54,140 --> 00:07:03,460
So everybody will give the same once you have learned what the medical agents that come from the pharmaceutical companies

25
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,900
have given you the latest information
this is the best remedy that you give for rheumatoid arthritis;

26
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,310
then the next day you take the remedy and you give it to all the rheumatoid arthritis cases.

27
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:31,410
In Homeopathy is a totally different story. The preparation is quite on a different level.

28
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:43,190
Because you have decided that this method, the conventional method is not satisfying, is not cure.

29
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:50,420
I like to find a method which really gives back health to the people.

30
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:58,910
And then you search and you prepare yourself, you go to different seminars, one seminar after another seminar

31
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:11,240
and finally you end up with Vithoulkas in Alonissos and then things look very, very difficult, very challenging.

32
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:30,900
And the question is what kind of a mind is that which can take up the challenge. What is the right frame of mind?

33
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:49,940
What is the right frame of feelings of a student who wants to bring about cures that almost border into the miraculous.

34
00:08:52,040 --> 00:09:13,860
You are not prepared to cure little colds, warts and the after effects of a bump. You give Arnica or Thuja and you have some effect.

35
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:23,860
You are prepared here to meet real challenges with severe pathology, people who are suffering very deeply

36
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:31,660
and they come eventually to you to be relieved from their suffering.

37
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:42,620
So who comes to you? The more famous you are, the most known, the more difficult cases will come.

38
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:51,420
That means those cases that have been
rejected entirely by all other therapists.

39
00:09:51,520 --> 00:10:06,460
So you can imagine the expectation, the inner preparation of such individual. Such individual has done some research,

40
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:16,980
he found out that Mr Jonh D. is the best
and he makes all the effort to go there.

41
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:27,640
The expectation is there and you
are Mr/Mrs John D. how do you feel?

42
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:35,410
It is of great importance how is your inner preparation.

43
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:45,010
Do you feel I am the greatest and
I'm going to cure everybody?

44
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:54,100
It doesn't matter what you show outwards.
The outwards appearance, as I said, is different.

45
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:06,580
The outward preparation, the outside preparation, what you look like, you put the most expensive collars,

46
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,790
you put ties, you put these impressive
clothes, you do whatever you like.

47
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:35,830
Eventually what is going to matter is the inner preparation. I can tell you, you are very good and you are in a little room,

48
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:44,580
you just have room for two chairs to sit sometimes you don't have a third chair when a family comes.

49
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,540
You say, you stand all the time and the other
two only sit there and see what happens.

50
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:01,090
But there is something which happens
when your inner preparation is correct.

51
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:08,040
That these people they don't care whether you stand, you sit, where you sit what clothes you wear etc.

52
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:23,030
There is an atmosphere which is created inside that little room which gives confidence to the people.

53
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:41,710
You think that if I have an impressive room, this will give confidence to the people. No. What will give confidence

54
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:55,870
is your inner preparation. Your outer preparation has started with study and what you needed for this,

55
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:07,350
the number one of what you needed, is enthusiasm to overcome all the difficulties that will come in your way.

56
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:15,970
Great enthusiasm and great one pointed mind, I'm going to learn that. Where is a book?
I read it.

57
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:21,100
Where is a new information? I will get it etc.

58
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:31,040
Enthusiasm and relentless gathering of information.

59
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:49,480
But if is missing the idea and the
desire to help the other person,

60
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:59,790
if you're not interested, if you say,
I'm good, I know, take Phosphorus,

61
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:11,220
if you have this attitude where you don't really care what is going to happen to the individual,
as long as you cover

62
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:21,500
some symptoms, you pretend in any way that you have done something for the individual

63
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:30,540
as long as there is this attitude,  forget about the success in Homeopathy.

64
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:46,950
For a time being you can be successful, you will be getting very tired of yourself and of listening to patients.

65
00:14:52,680 --> 00:15:03,300
Because if you have the right preparation
which is enthusiasm and the desire to heal,

66
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:13,300
it is a great thing to see somebody who is suffering come back and say, I'm not suffering, so much at least.

67
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:32,910
It is something which is almost bordering to the miraculous. It's beautiful and every healer is really filled with energy

68
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:52,600
and with satisfaction when he gets this feedback. Now if you take this feedback and for one moment,

69
00:15:52,700 --> 00:16:07,960
I tell you for one moment, you think really in yourself 'I'm the best or I'm good or I'm very good' or all these things

70
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:15,210
which you attribute to yourself, things have happened and you attribute to yourself, to your abilities.

71
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:25,470
It doesn't matter how you show outwardly, inwardly you should never believe that what you see happening

72
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:31,780
as a kind of miraculous cures are because of you.

73
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:41,900
You should not think, not for one moment because the next moment another case will come,

74
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,140
the moment that you say, 'oh how great!' it will be a disaster.

75
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:59,860
You don't know what to do. You are losing your mind, then the patient is dying. What shall I do?

76
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:07,380
Call the doctor, give all the antibiotics,
give cortisone, anything, you're lost.

77
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:19,550
Why? Because you had the impression what you're succeeding to do the day before, you could do it all the time.

78
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:33,980
Not with Homeopathy. Homeopathy demands from the individual to be very much aware of what is going on all the time.

79
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:46,740
Even a thought , I've done it. You talk to yourself, eh be careful.

80
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,760
The next challenge is going to be much worse than that.

81
00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:06,140
So the desire is there, the enthusiasm is there but the idea that 'I'm doing it' should not be there.

82
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:21,140
There is a kind of almost fear, I would say fear, when you take the simplest case, there is a fear that you may fail.

83
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:33,070
The idea is like somebody who makes miracles.
Will I be able to do something supernatural?

84
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:44,380
It is almost to that extent, the difficulty of treating with Homeopathy is to the extent that you are doing some kind of...

85
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:56,440
it's so difficult attainment as if you perform a miracle. Is it possible to know that you can do it everytime? No!

86
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:07,860
Especially when you have the attitude that I can do it. Because the moment you have the attitude you can do it,

87
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:18,780
I tell you what happens to many of my students. They became very famous and then eventually..... Why?

88
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:38,030
I am famous now. Then I relax. Now I can sit back, I can have a boat and go sailing in the seas of Aegean.

89
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:49,780
Then you start losing the information. It's something very peculiar that happens in such cases where you start

90
00:19:49,880 --> 00:20:02,200
losing the information. The Homeopath who
felt 'now I'm good' starts going down the gutter.

91
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:16,530
And as I said, there are a lot of my students who they, inspite of being very successful in the beginning,

92
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:24,530
because information is information. Information is fresh, you take it, you apply, you see the results,

93
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:32,040
immediately the fame is augmenting, becoming more and more.

94
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:45,800
There is a time when you feel 'now I'm secure'. That is the time when your fall starts as a healer, as a homeopathic healer.

95
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:59,860
The reason is that in a homeopathic consultation from the moment it starts to the moment it finishes,

96
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:12,440
after 3 years of treatment or 5, 2 years, 1 month of treatment whatever there is another inner phenomenon taking place.

97
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:26,700
This person is suffering, 10, 20 years and suddenly he comes there with the idea I may become well.

98
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:34,380
But what is to become well for a person who is suffering 20 years? 20 years of suffering and suddenly

99
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:50,020
somebody will say, 'ok be well, just whisper Pulsatilla'. It's finished the problem. He says, my God this is a phenomenon

100
00:21:50,120 --> 00:22:05,580
if you really see the whole thing it is a phenomenon. It is an idea which is beyond the logical abilities of the human being.

101
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:18,750
This person is suffering for 20 years and now is going to be released. What needs to be done?

102
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:27,660
Certain actions have to be done. Certain functions have to be done in order to arrive really at that state

103
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:37,270
where the person says, I'm not suffering anymore. What are these functions, conditions that have to be fulfilled?

104
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:52,560
You know that we have been acused of having placebo effect in our treatment.

105
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,480
Is it true or not?

106
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:12,660
Of course it is true. What is the placebo effect for us. The placebo effect is mostly the fact that you spoke to an individual

107
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:27,060
who felt that you really understood him/her.
She felt at ease and she felt that this person is really listening.

108
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,780
Why she felt that he really listens?

109
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:41,280
Because you are interested. Why you are interested? Because you have the desire to help.

110
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:46,240
So you have the desire to help.
Really the desire to help.

111
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:58,100
I don't mean a logical desire to help. I mean a real inner desire to help. My God I wish I could give him back health.

112
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:10,420
Oh my God he is suffering so much. What can I do? And then you battle, you battle inwardly. Anything else you forget.

113
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,900
My secretary says, you have a very good memory, eveybody who knows me says you have a good memory.

114
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,740
I don't have a good memory. I have a good memory only for the cases which they were suffering very much

115
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:34,050
and I remember them. Then I can remember for years what was happening to that individual.

116
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:45,230
Otherwise I don't have a good memory. I forget my keys, my car, I walk back home and the car is there, you know all kind of things.

117
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:22,600
If you really look in this interview it is a meeting point and a very important point in your life and in the life of the person.

118
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:41,740
It's almost a love affair. Can you forget a love affair? No. That's why I remember all my cases.

119
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:08,430
But on the outside what you show it is different and should be different than the inside. The inside

120
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:18,670
should not be revealed. I want to cure you. I love you very much and you hug the patient, you touch.

121
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:24,480
Forget all these tricks, they don't work.

122
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:39,230
They work for keeping some clientele because they say, oh what a nice doctor etc. but the real issue which is,

123
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:45,370
can you cure me, will never be realised.

124
00:26:52,130 --> 00:27:04,260
What happens is different than the external way of behaving towards the patient. You could say nice words

125
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:10,080
when you feel that the person is in real distress, of course.

126
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:20,180
You can be nice but also you should be
detached from the person itself.

127
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,720
You are attached to the idea of helping him,
not to the person.

128
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:41,260
Because the moment you get attached to the person, what a nice woman, yes come in, what's your problem?

129
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:55,900
The woman also looks at you, what a nice man. Well, she forgets the problem and she starts little things.

130
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:07,520
What you think about this pimple here?
Terrible! I must cure you.

131
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:22,380
And the real issues if you get involved on a personal level, you will never discover what is going on inside the person.

132
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:31,620
Because you are looking on the outside. You're looking at a person whom you like. But what you like?

133
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:40,440
You like the outside, her physique,
nice hair, the style etc.

134
00:28:47,120 --> 00:29:01,740
And this is attachment and it has as a result not being able to see clearly what is going on with the individual.

135
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:21,020
So therefore a Homeopath should, on top of everything else, be a master of his own feelings. You can imagine also when

136
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:30,880
you have given the right remedy to this nice woman, let us say, you like her and she comes back and she thanks you.

137
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,870
She looks at you like you are a God or a Godess.

138
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:55,700
It is an admiration and then you receive this admiration and you believe that you have beautiful eyes or whatever.

139
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,200
Don't get attached to this.

140
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:14,680
It's ok, I know I'm beautiful but what about
the follow up. Let's come to the follow up.

141
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:28,840
Let's come and see, can I further help you? Can I further investigate what's going on inside?

142
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:44,420
If you have this attitude then the phenomenon of healing starts happening. The real healing is a phenomenon.

143
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:57,660
We say we give energy, the remedies are energy. It is a phenomenon that is happening on another level than the physical.

144
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:10,440
And this phenomenon may start, as we say, with a placebo effect and continue and go deeper and deeper with the correct remedy.

145
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:41,050
Also the fact that you sympathise with the patient can augment, it can increase the placebo effect because it is homeopathic.

146
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:52,340
When somebody cries and you cry because of sympathy, it's like a homeopathic remedy because you sympathise.

147
00:31:52,440 --> 00:32:01,150
That's why you should not sympathise.
Outside you should not show.

148
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:16,060
Especially the first years of my practice I have tried to control myself not to cry in certain stories that were so distressing

149
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,700
and so outrageous what was happening to the individual.

150
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:27,660
One tragedy after another to come to that condition. You hold yourself there and you say, I'm not going to cry

151
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,440
because the moment you start crying you cannot listen anymore.

152
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:41,150
Can you imagine? The person cries and you cry and you embrace each other and you say, oh, oh.

153
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:52,300
Then you go back to the Repertory, what to look?
You don't know what to look. You are upset.

154
00:32:52,400 --> 00:33:01,180
You are out of your mind, you're sympathising. You have entered the state of the patient.

155
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:10,210
Can you imagine somebody who is just collapsing in front of you? You're collapsing next to him.

156
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:31,370
I remember a case in the center in Athens, he was a rather mature doctor and he comes while
I was looking

157
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,910
in different cases, in different rooms. He comes in the room, he says, George can you come?

158
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:47,070
The patient has collapsed. I go there and I saw the patient had collapsed and he doesn't know, he is a psychiatrist,

159
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:56,540
he is a neurologist and he does not know why the patient has collapsed. I go and I just see somebody

160
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:05,010
who is lying down there. He should be able to give me some information but no information, he has collapsed.

161
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:19,090
I said, ok don't collapse, wait. Tell me what happened, just a few information to know why is this,

162
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:28,490
because there is a shock,
there is a hysteria, epilepsy?

163
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,580
You lost, the moment you
got involved with the individual.

164
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:41,620
You don't sympathise, he is not sympathising. It doesn't matter.

165
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:52,050
What you know, you know. It is your problem whether you sympathise or not. It is not the problem of the patient to tell you.

166
00:34:53,650 --> 00:35:07,950
Your job is to try to bring about the phenomenon of healing. That is where your energy is. I like, but don't ever say it.

167
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:22,860
Don't ever say it even to yourself, this is a state of mind. It's not something that can be brought about by logic.

168
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:37,880
The more you want to cure inwardly, the more your success. These are the rules here in this science.

169
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:52,230
If we go to the side of the preparation of the Homeopath, has to be an all round preparation.

170
00:35:52,330 --> 00:36:03,220
It should not be a one-sided preparation. The Homeopath is going to advice in many, many issues of the patient.

171
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:13,120
The patient gets attached to the Homeopath. He sees that he found relief of his symptoms, he is attached to the doctor

172
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:20,610
and the doctor becomes his advisor. So he
will ask you, what to do with my daughter?

173
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:30,890
I have a problem with my daughter. She is a hippy. She is going out. What shall I do? And you have to advice.

174
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:40,920
And you are young, you are 35 and the man who is asking you for advice is 57 and he is the Dean of the University.

175
00:36:41,020 --> 00:37:02,710
And he is asking you what to do. And that requires an open mind to learn, to listen.

176
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:08,840
To learn to listen.

177
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:25,160
Somebody has to tell you something. Ah you stupid you listen to this man or woman? Because I'm learning something.

178
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:38,580
Even from very simple people you can learn. Ah you are a Christian Orthodox. Why do you speak with the Catholics?

179
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:49,080
Or why do you speak with Jewish? When some Jewish man wants to tell me something about his religion,

180
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:57,180
I listen very carefully because I would like to know how they think, how they eat, how they feel.

181
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:18,640
If somebody is Muslim I listen. There is an inner teaching of Judaism, I'm interested, the Kabala etc.

182
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:36,500
There is an inner teaching of Muslims, it is the Suffis, I listen, I don't close. And then I receive the information

183
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,090
and that information makes me an all around person.

184
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:51,090
Somebody is an artist, he wants to give me
his point of view. I will listen, I will learn.

185
00:38:53,190 --> 00:39:11,620
But I will never read junk, I will never go to a theater or cinema which is just a junk thing.

186
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:19,480
Cowboys, killing each other, what is there to learn?

187
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:33,550
So a Homeopath has to be an all around educated person that will be able to really give advice

188
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:40,780
but always that advice is not...I'm telling you.
It is almost a suggestion.

189
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:48,840
Almost the person does not know
that you have given a suggestion.

190
00:39:48,940 --> 00:40:01,130
You have to be careful about these things  because sometimes we can become very hard

191
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:05,320
without understanding what we're doing.

192
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:42,940
There comes a girl, she is 26 and she confesses to you that she has never had an affair. She goes to a psychiatrist.

193
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:58,370
And the psychiatrist says, you want to be well? Ok, make sex. This is killing the patient, not helping the patient.

194
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:08,210
To a girl who never had, you say go and have sex. What is this? She has no idea what is this experience.

195
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:25,710
Don't be stupid, do this, do that. This is very dangerous to feel that you have the answer and you can give it.

196
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:41,700
There is no such answer because each individual is unique and you don't know all the factors all around to advice.

197
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:48,540
Because you expect that individual will listen and will never do so.

198
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:56,260
Because you don't know the factors, you don't know the 25 different parameters for the individual.

199
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:16,340
Again what I found out is that, whenever you try to give a direct advice, almost never worked out.

200
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:26,180
That's why I almost never give an advice. I give the remedy and then observe what is happening.

201
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:40,650
And the opening up of the individuals, how they slowly open up and they find by themselves, the way out from the problem.

202
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:52,970
And the only thing you can do is just encourage. Later on, after 2 years of treatment, this girl of 26 says I found a nice man

203
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:59,960
and I'm interested, you encourage. You say yes, why don't you... you encourage them.

204
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:12,600
But in the very beginning to say, take that advice or you are homosexual, stop being homosexual,

205
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:24,710
be a bit on the other side or whatever. This is
not your job because we are not advisors.

206
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:41,700
We are Homeopaths and we rely mostly upon the remedy which we give. So therefore after all this,

207
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:49,500
what is the meaning of the homeopathic consultation? Conclusion.

208
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:18,130
You see how difficult it is to cure a person
who will not give you information?

209
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:24,700
Or he will give you some information and some other information he thinks it's not your job.

210
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:36,460
Then it becomes very difficult or impossible to cure such an individual. Another comes and opens up and gives you information.

211
00:44:39,720 --> 00:45:02,020
That is something like somebody admitting his weaknesses, admitting that I am a person with all these weaknesses

212
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:13,110
and when a person does this when somebody is full of heavy conscience, he has stolen things, he has killed people

213
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:23,670
and then eventually says, I will go to the priest to unload what is inside me.

214
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:31,690
That desicion is similar to the decision
of the person who goes to a Homeopath.

215
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:43,210
And the patient may not know exactly what
he has to do but your interest will show him

216
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:54,450
that it is to his benefit if he tells you what's happening inside and you can come to a conclusion.

217
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:10,550
So the meaning is the starting of
a clearing up of detoxification.

218
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:17,070
I don't want to use words that can be misunderstood like confession.

219
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:30,800
It is the beginning of cleaning the inside and then it happens that when he gives you out this, what is happening inside him

220
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:39,620
which bothers him and makes him suffering, then you are able to decide on the correct remedy and help him

221
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:47,350
by giving the correct remedy.
And then the miracle takes place.

222
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:59,000
So you have to see the homeopathic
consultation as something almost mystical.

223
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:14,070
You cannot really have success if you see
the patients as people who are going to

224
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,710
give you so much money.

225
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:35,860
Actually my belief is that this service which we call Homeopathy, should not be given against money.

226
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:47,700
But the Homeopaths should be
supported either by the governments

227
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:58,030
or by very rich people who don't
know what to do with their money.

228
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:11,430
-I disagree with that statement.

229
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:24,790
-Sure. I don't say all that in order to agree but just to think about and sleep over and in a few years time you come back

230
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:35,790
and you tell me if you agree or you disagree.
From all these people here you agree the most. You don't know it.

231
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:52,310
I say in an ideal society, in which society certain people have been given the privilege to have a lot of money,

232
00:48:52,410 --> 00:49:00,540
some others have been given the privilege of being able to cure people, this has to be distributed.

233
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:18,550
The good has to be distributed so there is eventually an equality, real equality, not the communistic idea

234
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:29,220
that there is a group of people sitting on a government decision and all the others are slaves

235
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:37,900
that they have to work for the governement. This is not the idea. My idea is much more idealistic than this one.

236
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:51,260
Somebody was telling me that I have a problem, this morning, she was telling me I have a problem charging money.

237
00:49:51,360 --> 00:50:00,190
I had a problem for years. I said, how shall I charge money for that thing. It was something which was giving me

238
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:07,510
so much pleasure. I was working as an engineer in the morning and in the evening I was curing people.

239
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:14,250
For years I couldn't think of taking
money from any person.

240
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:23,060
But when it came to the architect for whom I had worked previously and then he had arthritis.

241
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,690
-The Ledum case.

242
00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:37,820
-It doesn't matter what is the remedy. The story is more important, when he said I have a uric arthritis

243
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,670
and he couldn't wear his shoes. He said, can you cure me? I said, yes but you're going to pay me so much.

244
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:57,640
He thought, if he does it I will do it but I don't believe he will do it. Well he paid suddenly for all the other people

245
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:08,120
that were coming and I was not charging anybody for my services I didn't even feel were services.

246
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:26,420
I thought that actually it was, you may not believe this but the pleasure was so much that I really did not care.

247
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:43,300
There was an incident where I treated a man with a tumor in the brain. He had to be operated and I treated him for quite some time.

248
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:49,840
He was coming, going, coming, going, I was even giving the medicines myself, the little powder.

249
00:51:49,940 --> 00:52:03,950
In the end he makes an X-ray the tumor was not appearing anymore. So in the end of the treatment he comes

250
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:17,790
and gives me 100 drachmas. 100 drachmas
by that time equals to 1000 drachmas today.

251
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:28,860
Let us say, 5 marks. Actually the amount
where you can buy a beer or two coffees.

252
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:45,230
He leaves these money and he says 'I just give you something to have some beer' there is an expression in Greek.

253
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:54,240
And I was for 2 days I could not close my mouth.

254
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:07,600
I said God, what is my mistake,
what have I done?

255
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:15,690
The man was serious. He thought he was paying me back for the services I have done for him.

256
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:29,680
And I kept on doing the same thing of course until, you don't know the story? How I started charging?

257
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,290
-No.

258
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:47,630
- I started charging from 59 to 69. For 10 years I did not charge anybody, anything. In 69 during the dictatorship,

259
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:57,200
it was all kinds of spies were giving information
to the police and most probably

260
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:05,930
somebody gave the information that there something was going on that was very suspicious.

261
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:22,440
And the chief of the police got interested. What is this? Is this a kind of "yafka" where they prepare a revolution

262
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:39,150
to overturn the government or something like that? Secretive people who will not speak and the chief of the police,

263
00:54:40,250 --> 00:55:06,900
like the secret police of the area came together with a man in civilian clothes and they had a kind of X-ray.

264
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:21,430
He came to be examined by me and the young man had a duodenal ulcer. I said, where is your pain?

265
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:35,350
The pain is here. Where it extends? I investigated and at a certain moment I said,
what is this?

266
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:44,180
Either he is stupid, he doesn't look stupid, or something is wrong.

267
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:53,070
At a certain moment I was with one of my first students who was a psychiatrist, next to me,

268
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:56,180
but she would not talk, she was just learning.

269
00:55:56,370 --> 00:56:11,110
And I was doing all the investigation and at a certain moment they said, some things that didn't make sense at all.

270
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:20,950
I said to him, 'why are you here'? He said, 'I have ulcer I want to be cured'. I said, 'are you sure you have ulcer?'

271
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:39,940
'Yes, yes'. I said, 'no you don't have ulcer. Forget it. When I ask you this, you answer this.

272
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:45,890
When I ask you again later on the same question, you answer the opposite. Which one
is the true?'

273
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:57,070
There is an excitement. They said, 'give me the medicine'. They expected to give them the little powders.

274
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:08,840
I said, 'no I won't give you the powders, just go out'. The chief of the police sitting next to him without speaking until that time.

275
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:26,900
He brings out his wallet to pay. 'How much we owe you'? I said, 'nothing, go out'. 'No, we must pay'. I said, 'out'.

276
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:36,920
When he saw me in that state, he pulls out the ID and says, I'm the chief of the police. I said, ok what do you want?

277
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:46,980
He says, 'are you a medical doctor'? 'No. She is a medical doctor'. She pulls out her ID card and gives it to him.

278
00:57:54,450 --> 00:58:06,360
He was in a state of upset. He said,
'come with me to the police'. We go.

279
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:19,310
On the way he walks next to me, he says 'she is a medical doctor'. I said, 'yes'. 'Then why don't you charge money'?

280
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:29,270
Very suspicious because people were there and they were cured and did not charge money.

281
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:39,300
I said, 'under these conditions I cannot explain you why we don't charge money'.

282
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:04,790
We walk a bit further. He says, 'she is a medical doctor'. 'Yes'. 'Why don't you charge money?

283
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:25,610
It is very difficult for me to explain. What to say now to the chief of the police who takes you there to investigate?

284
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:34,680
And you will say, I pretend to be a saintly man who would like to cure people.  He will say, he is crazy.

285
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:43,360
He will grasp me and put me inside. I said, 'no I can't explain'. Then we go to the police. They had got all the patients

286
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:52,170
that they were coming before. They had collected all of them. So there is a conspiracy.

287
00:59:52,270 --> 01:00:00,620
Most probably against the government or against anything. Then they investigate and I'm sitting on the other room

288
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,440
and I'm listening to the investigation of the different patients.

289
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:15,150
Did they charge money? No, they didn't. Did they charge money? No. They could not understand what the hell was going on.

290
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:29,480
I remember also I hear an old woman who was investigated last. So she said, 'listen my son if you are sick,

291
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:53,380
you are always go to to go to him. Because he cures the people'. But in the meantime they have caught all the sugar pills we gave.

292
01:00:53,480 --> 01:01:10,890
'What is this white stuff?' They sent it for examination and then he comes to me to investigate.

293
01:01:10,990 --> 01:01:18,610
He says, 'do you smoke'? I said, 'no'.
He said, 'what is this Homeopathy?'

294
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:31,340
'Well it's a system you don't know yet. Maybe in a few years you will know'. In the meantime I hear the telephone.

295
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:49,700
They were several people because my student who was left behind she calls influential people who were cured

296
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:58,860
and these people were just calling
back and saying, let him go.

297
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:04,690
The biggest suspicion was because
we did not charge money.

298
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:17,280
If we were charging, it would be no problem because we're living in a society which believed in charging money.

299
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:27,660
And I belonged most probably to another society and I felt like coming from the moon.

300
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:43,220
And I remember a story from Dostoyefski where somebody was doing something similar. All the society was suspecting him,

301
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:51,540
it's not possible that he is not part of all
of us and he does something very different.

302
01:02:52,640 --> 01:03:02,580
Since that time I said to her, now we're going to charge every patient who comes, he will pay money.

303
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:11,820
Of course we charged very little. And
the whole thing continued very well.

304
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:29,870
Actually the man got promoted, he became the general secretary of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Health

305
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:39,970
only put a fine on me and the doctor
because we gave the medicine ourselves.

306
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,400
There was a rule in Greece that the
medicine should go through the pharmacy.

307
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:59,100
The doctor did not have the right to dispense medicines. So they fine 5000 for me and 5000 for her.

308
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:08,720
10000 was a big amount for the time. So I went I tried to find him in the police, they said he is in the Ministry,

309
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:16,430
the General Secretary. I asked to see
him. I said, 'Sir what have you done?

310
01:04:16,530 --> 01:04:24,430
You said all this for the investigation, this and that. Now we have to pay 10000. Where can we find them

311
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:35,880
since you know that we had no charged anybody. Where can we find that money to pay?' He felt like a fool.

312
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:51,990
He says, 'I have made a very good report for you and in case you need it, I can give you a good report that you are a good man'.

313
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:59,310
I said, 'thank you very much. Are you prepared to pay the 10000?'. Of course he was not prepared because

314
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:08,860
his salary was less than 10000. He had
to pay all his salary to pay the fine'.

315
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:19,980
But from that time we are forced to charge. That's why I say, I don't believe in charging for these services

316
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:33,030
because first of all these kind of services have no price. You cannot say you pay me this or you pay me that.

317
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:41,900
These services I don't think they have a price. First of all they cost nothing from an ethical point of view

318
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:49,580
and they cost too much from a material point of view.

319
01:05:49,680 --> 01:06:05,920
Because if you can give back the health to some people who have lost it, it's something which is absolutely precious.

320
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:13,070
You give them some very very precious
thing for which they can pay what?

321
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:31,140
That's why my idea is...but you hear her
saying 'I cannot charge', of course.

322
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,950
Anyone of you, when you started
you have similar experiences.

323
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:58,200
So these are a few things which concern the homeopathic consultation and the inner and outer happening.

324
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:19,420
-I've always charged because I feel the most honest thing you can do with a person is to charge him for your services.

325
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:28,700
Because this way they don't owe you anything, there is no sense of gratitude in the wrong way.

326
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:40,030
Of course when we restore health is a priceless thing for which you can never really pay; there is no way of

327
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:47,030
figuring out how much money will be but I really think that by charging the person you keep the relationship

328
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:51,230
very clean and very professional,
that's why I believe in charging.

329
01:07:51,330 --> 01:08:00,820
-You are right, absolutely right when you say that they have to pay something to feel that they don't owe you.

330
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:08,360
But if you feel inside you that they don't
owe you, it doesn't matter what they feel.

331
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:21,220
If I forget, today I received a telephone call from Israel from a student of mine. He said, there is a department in the hospital

332
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:31,060
for which I am now in charge and I have invited 40 medical professors and one professor from England and different places.

333
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:42,820
And do you remember the name of a professor so and so. I said, no I don't remember. He is a professor from England who says,

334
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:50,670
'ah George will be the speaker, that is great because I was his patient and he cured me and all that'.

335
01:08:50,770 --> 01:08:58,460
I don't even remember his name. For me, he does not owe me. For him, still after 20 years

336
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:06,240
he may feel gratitude. But for me, inside, I don't feel that because I cure him he owes me something.

337
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:19,700
So from your point of view it is correct in helping the patient and the society is such that we have to imply this method at this moment.

338
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:28,700
There is no other way. They have to pay because you have the rent, your secretary and all these expenses.

339
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:46,220
You need some money to do it. That is true but
I say in a society, in an ideal society then in order to equalize things,

340
01:09:46,320 --> 01:10:01,000
so the poor people do not have the stress. I hear for instance, today again, that one of my students is charging

341
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:10,430
3 times the money that usually charge. I told her to just go away from the center because she over charged certain people

342
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:21,420
and all the other doctors are working, you cannot have a doctor suddenly saying, no my price is that.

343
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:40,340
I said, alright you did 2,3 times, 10 times out. Now I hear the story that there is a very poor family from Skopelos

344
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:58,260
and they have to pay double the price. So they come here to be treated and they pay all this price and the story is told

345
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:07,980
by another man, friend to the family. He says, they're doing very difficult to pay all these money every month

346
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:19,660
to pay this doctor who says she is your right hand. This doctor says, I am the right hand of Mr.Vithoulkas.

347
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:25,480
I said, not even the left, nevermind the right.

348
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:42,140
But this kind of exploitation, you see
how easy it is to start the exploitation.

349
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:48,260
Once you block your conscience then
you start all these kind of things.

350
01:11:52,060 --> 01:12:00,080
Forget about finding the remedy. You will battle and battle and battle and nothing will happen.

351
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:11,310
-George, I remember that Hahnemann he loses his license by the beginning of last century because he was charged

352
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:29,280
with giving the remedies himself without payment to the people. They found this reason to take his license.

353
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:38,530
-Also in the life of Hahnemann, if you read it you will see his students ask these questions repeatedly.

354
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:49,260
And then he says, you charge, you make sure that they pay. And then he comes to America with Kent he says,

355
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:59,260
not only charge but when anybody shows the least doubt for your treatment, just stop the treatment and go out.

356
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:14,940
As soon as they doubt you, leave them. And he was a giant. Because he felt that people should have

357
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:26,380
a very great estime
and his integrity was put into question.

358
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:36,060
Like they acuse us all of us, you are charlatan. I'm charlatan? Goodbye.

359
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:46,320
-I didn't charge when I started and I noticed that people didn't take me seriously. I put an awful lot of hours and hours

360
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:55,390
and gave them medicine and next day they did whatever they like. That's why I decided well, they are going to pay

361
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:58,210
and then they take me seriously.

362
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:12,220
-Sure. All these issues are in a society which has a lot to learn still. We're living in a society with a lot of weaknesses

363
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:21,290
and a lot of misunderstandings.
And we have a lot to learn.

364
01:14:24,930 --> 01:14:35,220
There is all over the world Homeopathy beyond border. There is a group of people called "Homeopathy beyond border"

365
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:40,850
and they work and they're doing quite a nice thing. It would have been nice if each country  would do it for her poor people,

366
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:52,640
for people who can't afford and it pushes the Homeopathy and the knowledge about Homeopathy all over.

367
01:14:53,400 --> 01:15:01,410
-The first thing is to learn good Homeopathy
and then everything can be done.
