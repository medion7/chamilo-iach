1
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,079
Here is a Helleborus.

2
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:46,729
HELL - eborus to remember the state of Helleborus is the state of hell.

3
00:00:48,160 --> 00:01:08,250
I have never experienced in any other remedy, the anxiety, the agony, the state of the soul

4
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:16,209
 which is in hell and it's burning, suffering.

5
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:31,930
How the Christians they describe hell where you have things which are boiling and people inside.

6
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:54,289
Despair and extreme anxiety but when you realize that state, extreme anxiety. What happens to me?

7
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:06,319
Have you been on a boat where it's going up
and down and then you want to vomit?

8
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,090
There is a feeling as if your soul
 will come out of you.

9
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,769
Without the boat, the soul wants to come
 out from here, from here, from here.

10
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,600
And there is a state which really
 you say 'God help me!'

11
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:38,359
And you see the individual will go like
 this, restless, seeking for help.

12
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:49,519
Actually stating 'help me, help me'. What happens? He can't describe, he can't say.

13
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,729
You think he is going to die but from what?

14
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:07,639
The soul is coming upside down, inside, the sub-conscious has come up and it's overwhelming, it's hell.

15
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:24,400
When you see this case, the anxiety state with Hell., you give whatever and will not touch, will be worse

16
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:32,119
 Ars., Phos., you give Calc. nothing, Nit-ac.

17
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:44,759
You try all kinds and it comes there this anxiety, this fear, fear with anxiety, with upset inside.

18
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:58,050
If somebody was trying to pull out your soul and the soul cannot come out. If it's out you say OK I'm happy.

19
00:03:58,051 --> 00:04:04,519
You cannot die, you are in hell and
they are pulling your soul out.

20
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:09,759
This is the state of Helleborus.

21
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,280
Answers slowly, weakness of
memory, all these are words.

22
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:31,109
What happens is the sensorial
part of the human being is blocked.

23
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:40,689
And looks but does not look, he looks but he does not see. He does not see you clearly, I mean.

24
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:50,440
When we see, we see the
eyes, we understand.

25
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:58,459
I see her eyes and I know what she thinks, her fears, her anxieties and I see more or less what she thinks.

26
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:05,559
The Helleborus will look at you in a state
of panic and you see he cannot see.

27
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:16,599
If you ask him what he saw, he cannot describe. He cannot hear, that state is such an anxiety.

28
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:37,080
I remember my father in law.
He got at the age of 80, he got leukemia.

29
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:56,279
After extraction of some teeth, he suddenly developed leukemia and I didn't want to interfere.

30
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,889
My mother in law... OK take him to hospital.

31
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,880
 They took him to hospital
 and started with chemotherapy.

32
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:17,399
One bunch of chemotherapy 7 days, then 7 days no chemotherapy, then second bunch with the idea to have 3 courses.

33
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:26,599
In the middle of the second course,
 it was a total collapse.

34
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,730
The blood was oozing from all
over, it was coming out.

35
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:59,929
The plateles were very much down and then the hemorrhage started and it is the end of the case.

36
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,840
So they stopped the chemotherapy
 when they saw this condition

37
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:13,400
They said it's a matter of maybe one
more day, he will be gone.

38
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:27,860
Then I had the right to interfere with the case in the hospital. In the hospital it was one of my students also.

39
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,800
So I could manipulate easily
the whole situation.

40
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:35,879
 He said, worse, we stopped, we don't
 anything more, finish. You can do.

41
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:52,680
And I remember I gave him immediately
Merc-c. and then immediately after that, Phos.

42
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:57,600
and immediately after that he
developed that state of Hell.

43
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:12,600
He was half lost with the hemorrhages. The third, fourth day he came into that state of Hell.

44
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:29,359
All his life he was a very patient man, very quiet, patient, nice, soft and then he started becoming restless and calling...

45
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,760
Hell., the next day he was calm.

46
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:51,399
 In 15 days I took him out of the hospital.
Plateles we had over thousand.

47
00:08:51,400 --> 00:09:01,450
In 1 month all the readings
were almost perfect.

48
00:09:01,451 --> 00:09:11,479
 He still felt weak and he improved
until he was considered as cured.

49
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:22,969
But I remember that state of Helleborus because you see the person how he becomes under the state of Helleborus.

50
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:42,049
I have one or two cases on videos,
you will see more or less that state.

51
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:04,112
Of course the memory is affected also, forgets what he just read or done and there is irresolution.

52
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,610
Worse from 4-8 p.m.

53
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:22,859
That is interesting because we have another remedy, which is worse 4-8 p.m. How many know this remedy?

54
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:59,459
Yes Lyc. but you see in this remedy
 we have the same hours.

55
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:14,610
Meningitis, encephalitis, rolling of
head from side to side.

56
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,059
With the anxiety, rolling the head in bed.

57
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:43,799
The chewing motion in mouth or the grinding of the teeth usually comes from an irritation of the meninges.

58
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,790
Here we say chewing motion of mouth.

59
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:57,559
Bores head into pillow, vacant stare, brain cry.

60
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:12,040
And we have aversion to apples,
 total, it's very strange.

61
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:25,319
What apple has? It has a chemical which the body feels it is like poison. I don't know what it is.

62
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:39,920
I have cured a case, severe case
of allergy that was eating bananas.

63
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:44,830
 Give me bananas.

64
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:50,589
Very strong desire for bananas!

65
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:57,400
Tub. I gave Tub. and he was cured.

66
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:38,310
Urine is dark, red, almost black. This
is the tendency of the inner bleedings.

67
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,129
Then we have the dark, red urine like coffee.

68
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:55,399
The bleeding from kidneys,
from lungs, from everywhere.

69
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,520
Ailments after meningitis or encephalitis.

70
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:24,089
What is the ailments? It's the state in which I described to you, the loss of memory, forgets.

71
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,689
Where did I read this? I can't
remember, all this kind of things.

72
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,520
The rolling of head, from
 side to side is characteristic.

73
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,429
If you have seen one case, then
 you never forget it again.

74
00:14:47,430 --> 00:15:03,919
It is a state in which the agony is so much, help me. If you don't help them, they have to go to the asylum.

75
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:12,639
You cannot stand that state for long.

76
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:30,329
-I want exactly to know what looks like this person, when looking? Does he look as if he is looking through you?

77
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:43,673
-No. It is the agony and helplessness. 'What
 shall I do now? Do something quickly!'

78
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,820
I remember a case, he was going like that.
'Help me, help me, oh God!'

79
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:04,890
You stand back and you say,
what is this? What remedy?

80
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:13,832
If you don't kno, you had it. Because
 you cannot take symptoms in that state.

81
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,560
It is extreme. Do you like sweets?

82
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:46,599
Some homeopaths they go into
 that. What does it matter?

83
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,919
The whole thing is collapsing
and he is saying...

84
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:09,159
You have to get the essence. Tell me the idea. If you don't know the remedy, never mind the idea.

85
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:23,759
-Can this state be the beginning of heart attack?

86
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:31,780
-I don't know, maybe. Not in my
 experience but maybe.

87
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:40,359
But I would doubt because that state which I describe, is a mental state, quite deep.

88
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:46,530
Therefore the heart at this moment, it will function properly. It will not be involved.

89
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:59,669
But you may have an anxiety, which can affect the heart which can be Lach., can be Aur.

90
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,439
This is possible.

91
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:29,210
Of course not all Hell. cases
 will be that extreme.

92
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:43,659
But you get this dullness, this feeling of cannot think, forgets. What does it remind you?

93
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,679
It reminds you of Alum.,
 very good. Who said it?

94
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:09,959
It cannot think, cannot make a decision. Forgets names, forgets words, forgets numbers.

95
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:22,229
They complain of a mental dullness
together with a feeling of anxiety.

96
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:34,789
Students are very difficult to pass
examinations when they are in this state.

97
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:50,560
I knew a student, not Greek, I can't
remember now which country he was.

98
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:57,319
 He was trying to pass the examinations
 for years in the University.

99
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:08,520
He could not. His mental state was so dull, so difficult to think and he was in a terrible anxiety

100
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:14,319
because his parents were paying for his
studies and he wanted to please the parents.

101
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:23,670
And the more he wanted to please the parents, the more the anxiety was coming and there was this kind of anxiety

102
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:31,479
 agony and at the same time the
dullness and cannot concentrate.

103
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,399
You help these cases and it's like
 taking them out of hell really.

104
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:54,880
Niger is the black color.

105
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:07,519
It's a flower but the color, black,
the darkness, what we call the hell.

106
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,770
I don't wish anybody to be in that state.

107
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,480
Hepar Sulphur.

108
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:38,050
Over sensitive to pain. You see how strong it is?

109
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:45,920
Fears suffering. Suffering is
very intolerable for Hep.

110
00:22:48,090 --> 00:23:01,509
They are afraid very much of injections,
 things that sting them, wasps.

111
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:18,409
I was treating once a grown up man, I thought he was a Hep. case. I said to him, 'are you afraid of injections?'

112
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:23,250
He said, 'Oh my God let me tell you what happened when I was in the army'.

113
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:35,389
In the army they undress them and they put them in line, the officer is putting an injection, next, next.

114
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:43,409
He says, 'I could hardly managed to reach.
By the time he was ready, I collapsed'.

115
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:58,489
'The idea that he was going to inject to me, was totally intolerable. So I fainted, I collapsed'.

116
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,959
This kind of sensitivity.

117
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:11,529
I described to you another type where the person was fighting with the wasps and the bees and he was running all around.

118
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:22,689
These are very characteristic. Another characteristic for this remedy is over sensitivity to whatever pain.

119
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:32,729
They are people who are suffering
with mental and emotional pain.

120
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:55,349
A person is so vulnerable that you can imagine the family situation, for little reasons it will make them suffer tremendously.

121
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:10,279
A woman with her mother, usually
there is a kind of competition

122
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:16,529
between the mother and the
daughter because of the father.

123
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:25,279
They both want the father for their
 own. Usually there is a competition.

124
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:39,919
That can kill a Hep. patient because that competition is felt so much, so deep

125
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:45,219
 that can really torture the person.

126
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:54,649
It can really bring about such torture that you may have malignancy developing.

127
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:08,650
Organism who is so sensitive
 to pain, which is physical or stinging.

128
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:20,619
They feel the psychological
 attack as if there is a sting, a splinter.

129
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:29,170
That's why the pains of Hep. are like splinter.

130
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:41,480
 They get this pharyngitis or laryngitis
and the pain is like a splinter there.

131
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,159
Similar with Nit-ac.

132
00:26:46,400 --> 00:27:03,920
In Hep. the idea is, the sensitivity is such that
he feels this sting, he feels whatever is pointed

133
00:27:03,921 --> 00:27:10,369
and the pain is like a splinter.

134
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,369
Splinter like pains in the throat,
knees, gallbladder, wherever.

135
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:29,960
Sensitive to cold air or slightest draft.

136
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:41,089
Who is sensitive to cold? The remedies
that are very sensitive to cold are

137
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:49,759
Arsenicum album and Calcarea carbonica.

138
00:27:51,560 --> 00:28:10,780
This is more cold than all the others with the characteristic that if they are in acute condition

139
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:22,639
the moment that they take out of the blankets one hand, then there is an aggravation of the situation.

140
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:30,640
They cough more, they feel more the pain.

141
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:43,869
So draft is very much affecting them
 and also taking out just a little bit.

142
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:51,200
They say, if I uncover one part,
 the hand goes out of the blanket

143
00:28:51,201 --> 00:28:57,010
immediately the cough starts
 being worse, the sneezing starts.

144
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:18,959
People who are so cold that they have to cover almost everything and leave only this side, to breathe.

145
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:39,359
We have an over sensitive person who
reacts towards society in a peculiar way.

146
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:56,510
He feels inside him this vulnerability and
 giving out also an impulse which is violent.

147
00:29:56,511 --> 00:30:01,199
He wants to do violence.
He wants to put things on fire.

148
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:10,209
He wants to kill. He wants to
 do some kind of violence.

149
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:52,159
They are people with that sensitivity which are attacking, which can become rude and ruthless, abusive.

150
00:30:54,430 --> 00:31:05,570
And the impulse comes to kill like another remedy that we shall be talking about....

151
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:15,809
.... desire to kill, which is Hyoscyamus.

152
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:40,640
It's a remedy which we are using for skin eruptions, especially acne vulgaris and boils.

153
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,519
Unless we joke we cannot exist.

154
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,960
Acne which is painful,
which cannot be touched.

155
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:35,360
Painful to the exposure of the air.

156
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:53,580
And has desire for fat and spices. This is
 the peculiarity for Hep. Fat and spices.

157
00:32:55,800 --> 00:33:01,060
 And she is better in a
warm, damp weather.

158
00:33:01,061 --> 00:33:11,879
That weather which we have today,
damp and warm is good for Hep.

159
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:32,150
These people can stand very hot weather. We say warm but they can stand hot weather, damp.

160
00:33:32,151 --> 00:33:39,999
They feel worse in a dry environment.

161
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:54,499
Cold and dry, the north winds which
are cold and dry, make the Hep. suffer.

162
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:26,439
-Hep. being sharp tongued in his
form of attack to people?

163
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:37,159
-Sharp tongue I'm not sure but definitely they
 are people who have strong feelings.

164
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:44,359
They feel vulnerable, that they
 have been abused.

165
00:34:44,360 --> 00:35:02,559
And when they talk back, they talk in bitterness and in a kind of an abusive way but not sting.

166
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:13,250
They can be irritable, abrupt,
 abusive, angry.

167
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:23,909
For instance there is a remedy
which we will do later on, Sepia.

168
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:33,319
 Sepia is a remedy that will understand
 where is your weak point.

169
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:47,679
Very soon they will feel where is your weak point and they will say something exactly to that point.

170
00:35:49,770 --> 00:36:01,159
This is spiteful. This is not with Hep.
 Hep. is abusive, they will fight.

171
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,160
Sometimes they will have impulses
 to kill.

172
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:19,119
 But not real killing.

173
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,040
 It's not the remedy that will take
a machine gun and kill people, no.

174
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:17,430
Iod. is a patient who is burning
 very fast a lot of energy.

175
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:29,119
 Producing, burning out food
and transforming it into energy.

176
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:35,690
So much energy that they
cannot really stand one minute.

177
00:37:35,691 --> 00:37:44,479
They have to be on the move, they have to be restless, they cannot sit down and study and read.

178
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,509
They cannot sit down and do anything.

179
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:58,280
You can understand the inner probe that
 there is inside. Something pushes them.

180
00:37:58,281 --> 00:38:07,319
The energy is pushing them to get out the energy. Otherwise they feel they'll go crazy.

181
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:16,919
If you tie an Iod. person, on a chair, and say, you will sit there for one hour, he will go crazy.

182
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,690
He will break the chains.
It's not possible for him to stay.

183
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:34,969
 That is the central theme and of course with this energy which is produced, you can expect that is producing a lot of heat.

184
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:49,439
So it's a hot remedy, very hot remedy with palpitations and a person who needs a lot of food.

185
00:38:49,440 --> 00:39:02,430
Because the food is burned out and then he needs more food and he feels very empty in the stomach.

186
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:12,120
Once the food is in the stomach, there is a calmness, for a while. The headache calms down

187
00:39:12,121 --> 00:39:17,319
 the pains calm down, the
 psychology calms down.

188
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:27,600
And after a while that the food is gone, then it starts again the restlessness, the emptiness, etc.

189
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:37,319
Profound ability in great emaciation.
They eat and they lose weight.

190
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:43,669
Never mind how much they eat, they lose weight because they burn more than what they can eat. This is the idea.

191
00:39:43,670 --> 00:40:01,249
Then we have profound debility. The debility comes once the pathology starts and you have really a deep pathology.

192
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:20,149
That means the thyroid, which is the first to break down, in Iod. cases, then once it breaks down there is great debility.

193
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:34,270
A characteristic in the mental sphere is...

194
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:44,469
...they have a compulsive neurosis and they feel always that they have forgotten something, like in Caust.

195
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:52,960
Caust. they feel they have forgotten to close
 the stove, the door. Did I lock the door?

196
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:03,819
 They come back, they look and see it is locked, they go away, still they can come second time.

197
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:15,440
They get up, they go to bed, the Caust. and this is a similar situation with Iod. but the Iod. on top of this

198
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:22,319
 it has a compulsion for counting.

199
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:32,209
Counting the money, how much money? They put it back, they take it out, they count it again.

200
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:38,289
They go to the wardrobe. They count how many things they have in the wardrobe. They close it, they go back.

201
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,809
It's a compulsion to count.

202
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,960
The mind speeds up and controls the individual.

203
00:41:52,961 --> 00:42:00,969
In compulsive neurosis we have the control of the individual by his pathology, the mind pathology.

204
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:19,609
It says motion ameliorates. Sure.

205
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:37,759
We have constant motion of eyes,
especially in cases where we have a fever.

206
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:44,879
Especially if the fever is affecting the brain.

207
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:53,319
We have a brain fever, that means encephalitis, meningoencephalitis etc. We see constant motion of the eyes.

208
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:02,000
We see atrophy of testes,
ovaries or mammae.

209
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:15,529
Where do we see undescended
testicles, in which remedy?

210
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,760
Aurum, who said it?
