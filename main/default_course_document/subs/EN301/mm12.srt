1
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:29,640
In All-c. you have to remember a few things.

2
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:49,579
Of course the one that everybody knows is that the nose is running watery acrid discharge, that makes red the nostrils.

3
00:00:50,120 --> 00:01:02,689
The nostrils become red. There is lacrimation also. The lacrimation is not acrid; it's the opposite as the Euphrasia.

4
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,139
This everybody knows.

5
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,730
How do you recognize a chronic case of All-c.?

6
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:42,669
You will recognize by two things. One is a desire for onions. Excessive desire for onions.

7
00:01:45,250 --> 00:02:04,809
And another thing which is not recorded in our books it is sleepiness, excessive sleepiness. Lethargy, lethargic.

8
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:17,379
And you will see in common colds towards the evening where the All-c. becomes worse, they become lethargic

9
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:29,519
they want to lie down and you just want to sleep. The head is full, the headache is there, the nose is running

10
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,190
the coughing starts and you are lethargic, especially in the evening time.

11
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,440
This sleepiness and this lethargy can lead up to the point where we have a mental case.

12
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:57,799
And a mental case that will look like Opium, sleeping all the time.

13
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:11,539
I remember a case, the mother said I gave him some money to go and buy something.

14
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:22,739
And from the house to the shop, he lied down and slept. I went there in the shop, he had the money

15
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:33,109
 he couldn't remember what was to buy. He came back and he couldn't remember anything and when they brought the boy

16
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:39,790
 the boy was sitting there with his mother and as the mother was talking, the boy was sleeping.

17
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:53,419
And a total indifference about the surrounding. Whether you are there or not it doesn't matter.

18
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:01,139
He takes out his penis and urinates, oblivious of the surrounding.

19
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:10,829
The mother said, we were on the train and he wanted to urinate, he urinated in the train in front of everybody.

20
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:21,600
I'm talking about a boy of 14 years old; it's not a small boy of 2 years old.

21
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:33,609
But this shows the tendency of the remedy on the indifference, on the non perception of the surroundings.

22
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,729
He is oblivious of the surroundings.

23
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:50,099
No signs of catarrh. Nothing. In these chronic cases you will not have.

24
00:04:51,380 --> 00:05:06,529
One thing you have to remember that All-c. goes fast from the upper respiratory track down and starts

25
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:17,939
with pharyngitis, laryngitis and then bronchitis. And it can go very fast and in case that you are giving wrongly,

26
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:34,200
in a case of coryza you prescribe wrongly All-c., you will speed up the laryngitis or the pharyngitis and the coughing will start.

27
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:49,899
Also it is a remedy that you have to be careful in people who have sensitivity with their bronchial system.

28
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:57,099
That you don't give it easily because you will cause dyspnea. It will cause dyspnea very soon.

29
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:07,930
The cold goes down and people are sensitive and they start having dyspnea. That means the remedy was wrong.

30
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:23,739
Is pressed downwards, this is very important. Also All-c. is worse with heat, worse in the evening.

31
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:30,969
So you will confuse it with what remedy?

32
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:41,019
It's going to be confused with Pulsatilla because the moment the heat is there, the fever rises.

33
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:57,779
If you have a room which is very warm, the fever and the dysphoria arises; so they need to open quickly the window

34
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:08,560
to get fresh air and in the meantime they get fresh air, they are chilled. But heat makes them very much worse.

35
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:17,149
So therefore it looks like Pulsatilla. What is the difference?

36
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:33,409
The coryza with Pulsatilla is blunt. That means you will see no redness around this area.

37
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:43,239
With All-c. in 95% cases you will see redness around this area.

38
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,670
Which is another remedy which has this redness around this area in coryza?

39
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:06,949
Arsenicum. What is the difference? Ars. will need heat, All-c. will be worse from heat.

40
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:18,360
If you have a coryza that will start on the left side and go to the right side, the nose running on the left side

41
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:33,739
1 day, 2 days, then right side. Then this can be All-c.  What other remedy can be?

42
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,089
 A remedy which is worse in heat and goes from left to right?

43
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,160
Lachesis.

44
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:54,429
Onions which is very strong, better in open air, hoarseness.

45
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:19,419
It's painful hoarseness. You do like this and you feel as if the throat is split.

46
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:31,279
All these remedies that we have talked, we have talked on the essential features.

47
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:42,579
We did not talk about the essence of the remedy, a little bit on All-c., a little bit we talked about it.

48
00:09:50,370 --> 00:10:05,539
- I had a case of lumbago and I gave Bry. and this person had a sensitivity in the lungs. She had chronic asthma but not often.

49
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:20,539
And she got a severe asthmatic condition after Bry. for lumbago. Did you ever observe this for Bryonia?

50
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:35,579
- Most probably during the time of the lumbago he must have had some respiratory infection and the infection

51
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,840
 went down, most probably.

52
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:45,089
-She did not have.
-Well it's very strange.

53
00:10:47,310 --> 00:11:03,389
Most probably she had but she had no apparent symptoms because since she was sensitive in her lungs

54
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:16,179
 I believe that Bry. was suppressing in this caseand brought the respiration down. How long it lasted?

55
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:35,019
-It was very severe, it lasted for several hours and was not functioning. She had to get cortisone.

56
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:58,499
-This is the same with All-c., in case there is an inflammation here and you give All-c. you may have this problem.

57
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:08,059
I cannot explain this if you take it as a proving...

58
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:18,149
-What's the pathology this sleepiness about All-c. is something very new that the texts don't say it.

59
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:33,249
I have a case of a 42 years old man who has chronic sinusitis for 20 years.

60
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:52,939
He has a sleepiness to the extent that I have to go out to the waiting room, call him that your appointment is here

61
00:12:52,960 --> 00:13:01,539
and come into the chamber. He even sleeps if you have a little pause while you are talking to him. I gave him Opium

62
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:12,219
 because his airways are so full of enlarged mucus back here and in the nose also.  Where is the pathology in All-c.

63
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:22,149
I understand about Op. but how does All-c. gets to this state of sleepiness? Is it the sleep apnea as we explained in Op.?

64
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:30,939
-I don't know. What I know is that if you eat a lot of onions in the night and you have sleeplessness, you are going to sleep.

65
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:41,299
Garlic and onions, especially onions will make you sleep.

66
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:15,459
Actually it relaxes most probably the vascular system because both onions and garlic bring down the blood pressure.

67
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,889
And because of that relaxation, the stimulation which is there on the brain, becomes less most probably.

68
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:31,240
I don't know the physiology, it's very difficult.

69
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:43,749
In this case you can try because it is exactly the case that we are talking, the sinuses are affected

70
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:54,699
and this tremendous sleeplessness. Try high potency 1M, 10M and write back to me.
