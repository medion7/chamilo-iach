1
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:52,399
The strongest indication for Tub. is a hereditary tendency. That means parents who had tuberculosis.

2
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:03,959
The hereditary tendency that means it existed in the family tuberculosis, before the birth of the child

3
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,249
 that is the strongest indication for Tub.

4
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:14,399
You take it as a symptom and
that symptom has very high value.

5
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:25,309
Sometimes it overrides other symptoms which are quite strong but indicate another remedy.

6
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:45,399
The basic type of Tub. is somebody who
has the tendency not to stick with anything.

7
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:57,159
The tendency to go away to find another
 job, another lover, another interest.

8
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,039
They are people who have a very active mind.

9
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:23,299
 There is like fire inside them, burning the physical body like a candle which is burning in two ends.

10
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:31,209
And it's melting away the physical
body, giving a lot of energy.

11
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:43,559
Then the brain of these people feels that they can do a lot, they can accomplish a lot, they have the possibility

12
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,979
 to live a lot of possibilities.

13
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:57,519
 I can do this, I can be a musician, I can also be an engineer an architect and a doctor also.

14
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,809
This feeling inside them that they
 can do almost everything.

15
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:11,099
 They don't want to stuck with one
 person, with one job, with one situation.

16
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:38,369
That is a basic element of these people who usually are lean, they have a white transparent color in the face.

17
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,299
It's like candle.

18
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,830
Very reactive, quick to perceive.

19
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:04,989
The tendency is to leave the
 place in which they live.

20
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:10,319
That is why it says desires to travel.
The desire to travel is why?

21
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:17,899
Because the place in which they live
becomes soon a place of boredom.

22
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:25,599
In the same way they are very excited.
The first time they go to Alonissos.

23
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:37,839
 It's a beautiful place, fantastic, they are exalted, very happy and then they decide to come, they go and stay in Alonissos.

24
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:50,729
And after 2-3 months the whole enthusiasm goes down, the boredom starts. 'What shall I do here?'

25
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:59,610
'I am a person for the world.
I should go and do big things'.

26
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:05,689
'Here is a small place and
I'm suffocating here in that place'.

27
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:27,719
It's very interesting that Anton Chekhov who was the Russian writer -who died from tuberculosis-

28
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:39,610
-in all his plays there is this element
 of boredom and wanted to go away.

29
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:52,959
You read the 3 Sisters who live in a village and they are longing to go away, one day we go to Moscow.

30
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:02,350
Moscow is the place of fantasy
 where they will change their boredom.

31
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:15,959
It's very characteristic in his
plays the tuberculinic miasm.

32
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:34,559
And the idea of the combustions, of this burning inside and the longing and the desire to do so many things.

33
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:44,520
It's depicted in the physical
 body by great appetite.

34
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:56,979
They eat a lot and still they are losing weight. Their physical body is wasting away.

35
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,380
While they can be eating a
lot they don't put on weight.

36
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:14,389
They burn all this food in order to produce energy for all these projects and things they want to do.

37
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:26,639
It's interesting also that Tub. people will very seldom stay with a relationship.

38
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,880
They're not steady, they cannot be steady.

39
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:39,879
They get enthusiastic, they fall in love, they are very romantic, they are not rude people, they are not crude.

40
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:52,200
They are sensitive, with ideas, with strong feelings, they fall in love and after a while they find no interest.

41
00:07:52,201 --> 00:08:02,039
They cannot be with that woman. It's not possible. I have to leave. Suffocate, all this kind of excuses.

42
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,490
You know if you want to get out of
a situation, you say I'm Tub.

43
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:22,140
I cannot help it. It's not me,
it's the tendency which I have inside.

44
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,609
The chemistry.

45
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:33,090
The last case of Tub., the case
 of a young man, a musician.

46
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,529
He had an affair, the last
affair he had, with a woman.

47
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:50,540
He said, after a while it was so difficult to stay with this woman, he went to another country

48
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:57,519
 he fell in love with a woman from another country he went to meet her and she was very much in love

49
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:05,300
 because they are very lovable people, very alive, they describe things, they have ideas, feelings, so you like them.

50
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,470
She fell in love with him very much.

51
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:20,639
He said, it was so difficult for me to stay though she treated me so nicely, she gave me everything.

52
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,019
She was rich and treated him like a king.

53
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:31,370
He says, 'it was so difficult that I had diarrhea'.

54
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,359
He pressed himself to the point
where he started having diarrhea.

55
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,529
He said, 'finished, I have to leave'.

56
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:47,319
I said, 'do you grind your teeth?'

57
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,769
He says, 'my god I can't believe it'. 'Why?'

58
00:09:53,770 --> 00:10:03,839
'Because while I was with this woman, she
told me you grind your teeth and I said, no'.

59
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:15,340
'She says, yes you grind your teeth and how is that you know that I grind my teeth? Only this woman knows'.

60
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:50,729
He says, 'If somebody says to me, oh he
 is a musician. By this time I get chills because I feel

61
00:10:50,730 --> 00:11:00,479
that they put me on a box and I'm only a musician. I don't want to be a musician'.

62
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:09,589
'What do you want to be?', 'I don't know,
I have to be free, so I can be anything'.

63
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:19,720
He is a musician and he lives as a musician but the moment that he hears they put the label on him

64
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:34,490
he feels that he is now enclosed in that profession. And maybe he cannot leave.

65
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:43,559
The idea 'I cannot leave! I have to stay in Alonissos' and then it gets bigger and bigger and then they have to leave.

66
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,499
The desire to travel, of course.

67
00:11:51,770 --> 00:12:02,009
There are other remedies that have that need and the amelioration comes from different reasons.

68
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,250
Ignatia for instance.

69
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:17,450
 I have seen an ulcerative colitis case, of Ignatia and she would say, 'when I go for holiday and I travel

70
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:24,279
the moment I leave the
place the diarrhea stops.

71
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,560
And starts as soon as
I come back to the place'.

72
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:38,479
While the Ignatia is travelling and
changes pictures, she is perfectly well.

73
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:48,600
The Tub. is not like that, it's the idea of
leaving in one place which is boredom

74
00:12:48,601 --> 00:13:00,640
which is dragging him down, which encloses him. Making the possibilities are very limited.

75
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:16,640
Element of dissatisfaction in a child who does
not understand what is happening inside me

76
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:25,740
it will appear many times as children
 who are nasty and naughty.

77
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:38,760
In order to break their boredom,
-they don't understand what is going on-

78
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:46,439
 they have to do acts that enrage
 others, enrage the parents.

79
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:57,279
I remember another case where the mother would say about the child, 10-11 years old, she said

80
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:08,789
'he would go to the wardrobe and he knew I like this dress and he took razor and cut this dress'.

81
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:19,600
It destroyed the best dress of the mother.

82
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:30,079
Then you look and he doesn't know
why. They can do very nasty things.

83
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:42,840
They can attack, they can be aggressive
 with their sisters and brothers.

84
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:53,479
A great fear, which is very characteristic,
 has always to make you think of Tub.

85
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:14,359
This is fear of cats. It's not only fear. They may say, I have a kind of aversion to cats. I don't like cats near me.

86
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,098
They can be far away, it's OK I'm not afraid.

87
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,369
But when they come near...

88
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:28,920
They are also allergic to the cats.

89
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:39,999
They can say, I enter a room where a cat has been before and I can start coughing, so allergic to the cat.

90
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:53,390
It's not only that they will breathe
 one of the hair of the cat.

91
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:02,159
 Because cats are losing their hair and you breathe in and you maybe coughing also.

92
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,640
They don't have to come in touch at all.

93
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,759
And usually are people with allergy
 in their respiratory system.

94
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:30,279
The respiratory system is the
most vulnerable to them.

95
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,160
You get tuberculosis in different
systems and in different organs.

96
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:43,199
But the most common is the
tuberculosis of the lungs.

97
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:55,359
When I was lecturing many years ago,
in the class were some old Greek doctors

98
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:04,519
who have lived the era of tuberculosis. They were in hospitals where tuberculosis was very prominent.

99
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:13,429
 They were special hospitals where they would go, they separated themselves in order not to infect others.

100
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:27,420
When I was lecturing I was saying these things and one of the doctors who had himself been tuberculosis patient

101
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:36,599
and who, later on, he was doctor
on a hospital with tuberculosis...

102
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:46,880
and I talked to him about this intense feeling,
 this intense desire for contact, for sex

103
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:55,029
 these romantic affairs, he says, 'you are absolutely right. I remember in the hospital'

104
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:04,930
 where I was working, in the night we would find out that all the men were missing from their ward

105
00:18:04,931 --> 00:18:08,719
and they were all in women's wards.

106
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:19,369
And they had affairs and in the morning everybody was sleeping nicely.

107
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:28,439
And most probably they changed
 partners quite a lot.

108
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:42,840
It is interesting also to realize how
disease is undermining the organism

109
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:49,469
and deviates the organism in
its different functions.

110
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:14,070
When the Italian group was here, one woman said, 'George we want you to tell us what is normal in sex?'

111
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:29,520
The Italian woman says,
'finally tell us what is normal!'

112
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:36,040
I said, 'it will take one week. Are you
 prepared to stay one week?', 'Yes!'.

113
00:19:44,560 --> 00:20:09,879
The normal according to my understanding of course is that a man and a woman are made only for one relationship.

114
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:22,839
Which can be satisfying and can be rejuvenating and can be interesting for all times.

115
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:40,319
This is what would be the most
 normal for human beings.

116
00:20:51,290 --> 00:21:02,080
That was sub-conscious absolutely.
I am innocent.

117
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:34,549
There are some birds like pigeons, they form a couple and if one dies, the other stays celibate.

118
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,679
-This is a legend.

119
00:21:46,280 --> 00:22:01,520
-It's a legend also that pigeons are the symbol of peace but it's the most evolved from the birds

120
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:10,389
and the most evolved from the humans should compare with the most evolved from the birds.

121
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:20,309
I really feel that this is correct
 but why it does not happen?

122
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:26,279
It's because of diseases that undermine.

123
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:37,079
The disease has undermined the human organism in such a way as to bring about different deviations.

124
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:45,850
So a child at the age of 11 starts having strong sexual desire. We see children at the age of 7,8,9

125
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:52,800
they start masturbating because
 it's a hormonal disturbance.

126
00:22:54,530 --> 00:23:05,019
These children how can they keep celibate until they find the right man or the right woman to live together?

127
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:09,479
They cannot wait, so the first
chance they have, they have sex.

128
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:19,000
Then the more they have sex and the more the deviation goes and in the end what happens is,

129
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:28,789
even if you meet your real partner in life,
you cannot recognize it anymore.

130
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:36,000
You think it is one of the usual...

131
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:42,999
What is the usual? To have an affair for 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, 1 week, whatever.

132
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:54,959
Depending on the hormonal imbalance because there are people who need sex 3 times the day; it's a hormonal imbalance.

133
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,729
Let's not go to that subject.

134
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:22,560
I believe in an ideal society where people are healthy, they will not have sex before 18 or 19 years old, no one.

135
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:33,979
And then at this age may still start searching for the right person to be connected and to have a relationship.

136
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:47,169
I lived in India and I saw this. The Indian culture is such that does not allow, does not give the possibility

137
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:52,669
of multiple contacts.

138
00:24:52,670 --> 00:25:04,119
As a result we have marriages that
stay much more than the European.

139
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:11,209
When they die they burn the wife? No.

140
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:18,569
-I heard that some of them are very miserable...

141
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,560
-No, I don't agree. She said, some of
them are very miserable. Some, OK.

142
00:25:30,561 --> 00:25:46,939
But concerning the misery that the western people are going through by practicing these kind of relationships is nothing.

143
00:25:50,170 --> 00:26:05,879
It is much more happy as a race than we are because of that reason. Because they stay celibate.

144
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:16,040
I was in the College and I was quite older, 27 years old when I was in the College there and

145
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:20,649
the others were 18,19,20,21.

146
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:32,639
And I talked with a lot of my schoolmates. None of them had any physical contact with a girl.

147
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:39,440
All of them were in a platonic state of love.

148
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:50,769
This girl I love etc. but they wait and when the marriage comes, the marriage holds.

149
00:26:50,770 --> 00:27:01,929
Later on I went to America and I had a class and I said, how many of you are divorced? The whole class raised their hands.

150
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:11,679
They were young doctors from 25-39.
 All of them were divorced.

151
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:21,639
But Tub. is one of the remedies that will
 not stay with a... Why they don't stay?

152
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,610
Because of the miasm.

153
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:40,440
And then take syphilis and take the sycosis, take gonorrhea and see why we have so much

154
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:44,369
deviations in sexual matters.

155
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:58,379
We also find some cases where they have these ritualistic behavior; where they have to do their bath in a particular way.

156
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:06,359
First you take the soap and you put it there. Then you take the sponge and you put it on the other side.

157
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:14,439
Then you open the water for a certain period of time. Then you take this and that and they cannot

158
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:23,129
get out of this ritualistic behavior
which is quite limiting.

159
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:44,439
Another keynote which is very strong is the desire to have fat in their food. And which is the most fatty meat?

160
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:58,429
They love pork. When they say, 'I love pork'
 you have to think of this remedy immediately.

161
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:08,479
There is also another strong desire from the
side of the fruits which is desire for bananas.

162
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,660
Excessive desire for bananas.

163
00:29:12,661 --> 00:29:20,780
Pork and bananas if they say these two,
what do you like? Pork and bananas.

164
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,759
This is the only remedy
that you will have to think.

165
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:35,000
It is a remedy which is usually affected by
cold very much.

166
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,589
They are worse in the night.

167
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:50,319
The night time is difficult and especially the anxiety rises during the night and becomes unbearable.

168
00:29:51,570 --> 00:30:06,719
Coldness and dampness is aggravating them and that is why we say that the Tub. people are worse in the sea.

169
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,310
It is not the salt of the sea, it is not
 the elements of the sea.

170
00:30:11,311 --> 00:30:20,839
It is where you get cold and wet and
 they are getting worse if they go bathing.

171
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:29,970
But from the pathology point of view of course, you will need in frequent colds, frequent bronchitis

172
00:30:29,971 --> 00:30:40,469
frequent infections of the respiratory
track indicate the possibility of Tub.

173
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:49,800
Grinding of the teeth is a concomitant
 which is very characteristic.

174
00:30:52,440 --> 00:31:00,719
Strong and repeated infections on the respiratory tract with grinding of the teeth, makes a case of Tub.

175
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:11,849
Where frequent infections we have in Calc., we have in Sulph., we have in Psor., we have in Sil.

176
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:22,069
we have in different remedies. But when it's coupled with grinding of the teeth, then we think of Tub.

177
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:27,639
Better in warm weather of course and dry weather.

178
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:42,079
Another thing that you have to remember for Tub. is that it has rheumatic and arthritic conditions which

179
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:53,710
resemble Rhus-t. Worse in the beginning of
the movements and eventually amelioration.

180
00:31:53,711 --> 00:32:03,391
 Worse cold and wet and you give Rhus-t.
And Rhus-t. does nothing.

181
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:14,279
 And then you ask about fruits
and he says, 'I like bananas'.

182
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:20,249
You see how you differentiate with little
things, little information like that.

183
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:31,059
'I like pork'. It goes from Rhus-t.... 'I desire
 cold milk', there you have to differentiate.

184
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:43,839
If the cold milk is very strong, I can drink 3
 liters of cold milk a day, that is Rhus-t.

185
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,089
1.5 liter cold milk it is Tub.

186
00:32:52,250 --> 00:33:06,479
Rhus-t. also would like milk whether cold
or warm but Tub. would like only cold.

187
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:14,800
It is a burning feeling inside which
they have to calm it with cold things.

188
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:23,199
Drinking cold milk, drinking cold drinks,
 taking ice cubes, taking ice cream.

189
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:51,599
Rhus-t. does not like cold things, except from milk. It can drink cold milk but in general does not like cold things.

190
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,969
Tub. likes to drink or to eat cold things.

191
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,079
-There are different sorts of Tub.
 Is there a difference?

192
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:18,599
-For me I have used Tub. Bovinum. I have not used the others. I don't know. I cannot say.

193
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:40,999
- It's not only that Tub. people don't like cats.
 Also the cats don't like them.

194
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,590
I have a child with many colds, she was so typical Tub. that I didn't ask her about cats

195
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:53,870
but the mother related that when she came home for the first time in her life, she was 5 years old

196
00:34:53,871 --> 00:35:03,209
 the cat came near to her. I gave her the Tub. and half an hour later the situation already was different.

197
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:10,199
 The cat came to the child and the child for the first time contacted the cat. And the cat never liked the child.

198
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:17,820
-The cats are very independent things.

199
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:29,320
They can answer, they cannot answer, they
 do whatever they like, like a woman.

200
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:41,079
-I would like to know if there is an influence on us because most of us got Tub. vaccination. What is the influence from this?

201
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:54,389
-If you are Tub. really, you have a big reaction. That means you have a predisposition.

202
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:08,489
If somebody had a big reaction on tubercular vaccination, you have to consider Tub. for that person.

203
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:28,069
-My daughter when she was born she was quite low and in Israel they usually give the first day the Tub....

204
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,150
-The first day?
-The first day, as they are born.

205
00:36:31,151 --> 00:36:35,479
They used to, 27 years ago. Now
 they don't give it at all.

206
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:42,369
For the whole year or two years it was coming out and stopping, coming out and stopping and she didn't eat

207
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:52,079
 she was really low. Then she had a pneumonia about 2 years old and they checked with the test

208
00:36:52,080 --> 00:37:04,279
and it was very huge and they started giving her pills every day against tuberculosis and she started eating.

209
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,823
She quite resembled this picture
actually. Could it be?

210
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,879
-Sure absolutely, you must consider it.

211
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:28,410
-There was a case that I thought she was Tub. She is a nurse in the hospital and she has made this test

212
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:40,440
they wanted to look if she got in contact with tuberculosis in her work and there was a patient in this hospital

213
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:56,309
who had active tuberculosis. I was not
sure if I now give Tub. to the nurse.

214
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:00,599
 Could I make her more
sensitive to this disease?

215
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:09,129
-By Tub., if it is indicated, you
 will protect her definitely.

216
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:25,639
-I would like to ask, if anybody else has this experience also I want to relate it back. One of my Tub. children

217
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:33,492
 it was not very malicious but many pneumonias and much better after Tub. but many and high doses.

218
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:42,429
And then I was in Alonissos and somebody in the kinder garden made the test and I found it out by chance afterwards.

219
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:49,200
The child got very sick, it got 40.000 leucocytes, they had to send it to the hospital and they found a pneumonia

220
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:56,659
without any microbes. They didn't know what it was, they gave lots of antibiotics and it didn't really help

221
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:03,399
 but after 5-6 days it receded.
And it had to have Tub. afterwards again.

222
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:11,480
 And I though is it possible that the child was so sensitive to Tub. that these children if they are under treatment

223
00:39:11,481 --> 00:39:16,650
 they shouldn't get the test.  I try this
 now with all my Tub. children.

224
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:37,049
-Yes, that means the child was still on Tub. level and the fact that they gave  actually the test, which is the same thing.

225
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:44,549
The child was very, very sensitive to such tuberculosis and the whole organism came down.

226
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:54,160
Because the organism tries to fight out the vaccination or the test with the antibodies produced

227
00:39:54,161 --> 00:40:01,600
and bringing down the defense.  Then of
 course pneumonia or whatever can appear.

228
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:11,499
It's not always that this happens. The child
was very sensitive to the vaccination.

229
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:20,249
-Tub. people are much better on the mountains and pine woods. Those hospitals have always been on the mountain.

230
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:39,939
-That is true. They need a specific height like
 600 m. which they feel best in that height.

231
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:48,429
If you take them to very high place,
like 3000 m. they will not feel good.

232
00:40:51,160 --> 00:41:02,190
Most probably it is the best concentration of oxygen and due to the fact they do not have perfect lungs

233
00:41:02,191 --> 00:41:04,790
 they feel better there.

234
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:18,959
-If you have a patient who's about 60 years old and you know that she has part of the lung removed

235
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,459
when she was about 18 because of tuberculosis, would it be dangerous to give her?

236
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,199
-No, not at all.

237
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,720
- The father had twice in his life tuberculosis. Twice he was in a sanatorium up in the mountains

238
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:43,169
and later on he worked in the gastronomic field. He was smoking a lot and he died at 78.

239
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,960
Up to then he was quite healthy.

240
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,080
 What happened, without Homeopathy?

241
00:41:52,600 --> 00:42:02,969
-He was cured by his organism.
He had a strong organism.

242
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:11,119
You get tuberculosis when you are
 putting yourself under a stress.

243
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:23,320
And if that stress concerns mostly the
 emotions and there is a predisposition

244
00:42:23,321 --> 00:42:30,919
then the possibility of tuberculosis
arises very much.

245
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:47,870
In the older times where things
 were much more strict in families

246
00:42:47,871 --> 00:42:54,639
and a woman would fall in love with
a man whom she could not marry

247
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:02,600
it was known that because of that longing, because of that desire which was not fulfilled

248
00:43:02,601 --> 00:43:08,879
 the woman could waste away
and could go into tuberculosis.

249
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:28,490
Even they were stories written about such cases. The constant stress upon the feelings of the person

250
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:34,869
if there is a predisposition,
 it may lead to active tuberculosis.

251
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:48,890
But if such a person finds a solution to that, at the same time it does something which promotes his health

252
00:43:48,891 --> 00:43:56,609
 right food etc. then he may
recover from tuberculosis.

253
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:10,330
Strong organisms which belong to the
first group, they can go to tuberculosis.

254
00:44:10,331 --> 00:44:15,079
They will recover perhaps even by
 themselves like her father.

255
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:34,539
-If I remember correctly my mother told me that people who had tuberculosis used to get a lot of pork, ham to eat to recover.

256
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:45,519
-Could you then look at Tub.
as a remedy for grief?

257
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:58,670
-For grief yes, if the grief is connected with
 a love, not love disappointment.

258
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:15,369
You cannot fall in love for long time with somebody whom you think is not interested in you.

259
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:24,360
So Tub., how it can develop? It can develop when you know this man is interested on me, I'm interested in him

260
00:45:24,361 --> 00:45:34,319
so there is this longing, this hope that this is going to be a very good affair. And somebody is preventing you.

261
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:46,389
 So that kind of grief yes. But the grief when somebody leaves you and it's a rejection, no.

262
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:52,209
The grief has to have a particular type.

263
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:06,489
The grief from different remedies they
 have a different connotation.

264
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:11,239
Aurum grief is different than Ignatia grief.

265
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:27,609
Aurum grief is very deep and it concerns
the ego, it has destroyed the ego.

266
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:52,519
The Ignatia is a grief which has cut off the possibility for contact and possibility of emotional rapport.

267
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:01,850
-You said that Tub. is a remedy for
arthritis and rheumatoid affairs.

268
00:47:01,851 --> 00:47:10,719
 Is it too a remedy for arthrosis,
degenerative joint diseases?

269
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:23,349
The discs are destroyed, they
are degenerative diseases.

270
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:39,759
-Is she talking about ankylosed spondilitis
or spondiloarthritis, deformative arthritis?

271
00:47:42,270 --> 00:48:00,509
Anyhow. All these diseases, all this group
of diseases they can be helped by Tub.

272
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:11,820
For instance osteoarthritis
 cannot be helped by Rhus-t.

273
00:48:11,821 --> 00:48:23,869
Osteoarthritis needs remedies like Nat-s.,
 like Kali's, like Calcareas, Sulph.

274
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:36,199
Tub. goes deeper and can affect
 or can make better the situation.

275
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:43,440
Tub. is a remedy that you may
need as an intermediate remedy.

276
00:48:43,441 --> 00:48:53,559
 Maybe not as the first remedy but as the case progresses there are some symptoms of Tub. appearing,

277
00:48:53,560 --> 00:49:02,340
 which show that there is the tubercular miasm somewhere in the case  but not as a first and main remedy.

278
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:09,649
Tub. is similar in this respect to Carc.

279
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:26,280
-You can read very often that if the child is hairy along the spine on his back, that this is a sign of Tub.

280
00:49:26,281 --> 00:49:28,599
What do you says concerning
your experience?

281
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:40,590
-I have seen other remedies
having that as well and this is true.

282
00:49:40,591 --> 00:49:47,439
 But I have not confirmed this frequently
 enough to give it as a keynote.

283
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,809
Because if you give it as a keynote,
 you see this, you give Tub., then you fail.

284
00:49:54,130 --> 00:50:01,410
But some of the cases they may
have this hormonal disturbance.

285
00:50:02,411 --> 00:50:10,759
 My problem is that I connect all things together.

286
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:27,480
For instance, when a woman develops hair
in the body, that means actually that we have

287
00:50:27,481 --> 00:50:35,139
 male hormones excess in the body.

288
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:51,439
My problem is this, that Tub. I have seen it is not a case of a woman where there is this type of person sexually.

289
00:50:53,230 --> 00:51:02,980
You see it is different the behavior of a woman with hair, with high testosterone and it's different in sexual contact

290
00:51:02,981 --> 00:51:08,949
with a woman whose hormones
are mostly female hormones.

291
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:16,680
And Tub. has mostly female hormones.
So it's difficult for me to say this may be.

292
00:51:16,681 --> 00:51:20,190
Maybe sometimes it goes to the other way.

293
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:35,829
Like pork, like grinding of the teeth, like fear of cats, aversion to cats, these are strong elements for Tub.

294
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:45,959
Especially when you have that type of person. The hairy part is with a lot of other remedies.

295
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:52,109
Even Phos. can have hairy part.

296
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,439
-Only in new born.

297
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,799
-I don't know.

298
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:25,800
-I've seen in children this violent behavior, the kicking, the biting, the striking and so forth.

299
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:32,769
In adults, as they mature, does this violent behavior persist or they just develop this tremendous

300
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:37,359
restlessness moving from
one situation to another?

301
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:50,199
-The violence here is subtle, it's not
a violent person that will fight, quarrel.

302
00:52:50,200 --> 00:53:00,609
What you are describing, I would think of Tarent., I would think of Stram., of more aggressive remedies.

303
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:10,699
This has a violence which is more subtle. And that subtle violence of course will develop as deviations

304
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:15,760
 in a grown up where he can control this.

305
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:22,390
- Concerning the question you
just had before, I can add something.

306
00:53:22,391 --> 00:53:27,129
My father had tuberculosis and we have a
lot of cases of tuberculosis in my family.

307
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:33,229
I was born as a baby with hair on my back,
 black hair on my head and on my back.

308
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:44,809
When I was a little child I had tuberculosis in the lymph nodes of the lungs, in the middle part of the lungs.

309
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:56,029
-You should have said that in your ... We keep it in mind.

310
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:14,780
-In my homeopathic treatment I already got Tub. and before that concerning my character I was always on the go

311
00:54:14,781 --> 00:54:17,343
always jumping from one topic to the next.

312
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:24,639
I never felt at ease in my relationship. I always thought I have to look for a different man, this is not the right man.

313
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:31,889
After Tub. this settled, this calmed down. Changed completely.

314
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:49,119
-I had a child of 5 years and I gave him Tub. because of his mental state and this little boy had phimosis.

315
00:54:49,120 --> 00:55:00,119
This phimosis went away within 14 days. Do you know more cases of Tub. healing phimosis?

316
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:11,469
-The first time I hear that but what happened with the child in general? What was his character?

317
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:19,380
-It was very destructive, very provocative towards the mother, he said no to everything and anything

318
00:55:19,381 --> 00:55:26,959
and after Tub. the child a 100%
better on his character side.

319
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:41,699
-Provocative maybe is a very good word for describing. They just want to create emotions.

320
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:55,069
-I had a child and I was treating her with Tub. and she had a very bad cough and I gave her Tub. and then

321
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:57,679
she developed whopping cough.

322
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:03,950
This whooping cough was very bad for one week and then it was gone and with this too all the

323
00:56:03,951 --> 00:56:06,719
respiratory tract affairs were going too.

324
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:13,550
My question, you hear again and again that if children diseases come up, they might

325
00:56:13,551 --> 00:56:17,979
extinguish a miasmatic layer, is that true?

326
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:34,689
-If the child disease comes up, that the
disease itself extinguishes a miasmatic layer?

327
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:40,360
Well there is some kind of truth about it.

328
00:56:40,361 --> 00:56:54,440
It is better to let the epidemic diseases, in my understanding, go through instead of trying to suppress it

329
00:56:54,441 --> 00:56:59,159
by different vaccinations, as they do today.

330
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:09,640
But this idea may take many, many years before finally is established because it's going to be understood

331
00:57:09,641 --> 00:57:21,239
that the other way, trying to suppress all these children diseases is not the best course of action for the human race.

332
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:34,529
-Do you know any cases of Tub.
 who likes or even loves cats?

333
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:47,899
-As far as I can remember yes. I can recall certain cases which they had no problems with cat.

334
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:06,910
I'm interested very much to hear your experiences on the remedies that we're talking about.

335
00:58:06,911 --> 00:58:09,260
Just to get a feedback.

336
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:20,219
-I read in a book of Bernett that he gave for children, with a lot of infections, Bacillinum in between.

337
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:27,199
For example Calc. and in between Bacillinum. What that be the same procedure as you described?

338
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:36,360
-Yes, it's the same idea. It's protection through the right remedy. Of course if you do it mechanically

339
00:58:36,361 --> 00:58:43,609
you just give mechanically to everybody,
some will be protected, some will be not.

340
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:54,850
-A young woman who might be treated for mild psoriasis with Carc. and Ign., she would not respond to that

341
00:58:54,851 --> 00:59:02,639
and then she went to China for one month with a girlfriend and psoriasis disappeared completely

342
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:11,319
 only to return when she returned home. Would that be the desire for travel and into the direction of Tub.?

343
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:21,560
-This is rather a symptom of Ign. You gave
 Ign., maybe you had to go higher in Ign.

344
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,909
 because you had some
reasons for giving Ignatia.

345
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:36,530
Maybe the Ign. you gave was not active, maybe you have to use other pharmacies or two pharmacies

346
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,749
 and give Ign. higher.

347
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:49,289
-But the psoriasis started before she had
 reason for Ignatia. Many years before.

348
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:57,879
-Still the layer of Ign. is there. So first you eliminate this and then you find out what is left.

349
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:14,270
- As to the hairy state, as I've been working with many Turkish and Arab people, in the middle of Berlin

350
01:00:14,271 --> 01:00:19,929
I see very many babies who to my impression have Tub. miasm.

351
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:27,780
They have very long eye lashes, blue sclera, very many of them and those who might be treated with Tub.

352
01:00:27,781 --> 01:00:33,709
 most of them had a hairy state.

353
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:47,489
Of course all people around the Mediterranean have more hair than German people but it was really very regular.

354
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,439
-It's a matter of race rather than...

355
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:59,949
-The other thing is, I also have had very aggressive Tub. children.

356
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:04,830
Of course they are different from other aggressive children. They look if you look

357
01:01:04,831 --> 01:01:12,959
and they only do something bad that they see they can make somebody angry, it's subtle.

358
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,039
-Exactly, this is absolutely correct.

359
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:29,390
-A child, one of my patients, got Brucellosis by chick and the parents went to hospital with the child

360
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:40,759
and it got antibiotics and when the child
came home, it got rheumatoid complains.

361
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:46,600
The grand father of this child had tuberculosis and I gave Tub. to the child and these

362
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:50,639
rheumatoid complains went away completely.

363
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:59,619
-Were the modalities of the case, if she remembers, were Rhus-t. modalities?

364
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:03,609
-Yes.

365
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:12,989
-I have two very interesting observations concerning my patients. One is a young man

366
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:19,479
he came to me because of palpitations after playing squash. His heartbeat was very fast.

367
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:27,680
I found out that when he saw
 a cat he got the desire to kick her.

368
01:02:27,681 --> 01:02:33,369
During this I asked him if there was
any case of tuberculosis in his family?

369
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:36,120
And he said yes, his grand father.

370
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:43,049
And he got Tub. and afterwards he never had again the symptom of having the need to hate a cat.

371
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:47,189
And he was able to go on playing squash.

372
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:53,849
And another little boy was masturbating right in front of me during the history taking.

373
01:02:53,850 --> 01:03:03,449
And after giving Tub. his masturbation desire was getting better and too his frequent colds.

374
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,900
-Very interesting.

375
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:22,879
This kind of behavior, you see the whole idea? They like to provoke reactions, angriness.

376
01:03:25,550 --> 01:03:32,520
-Six weeks ago I gave Tub. to a schizophrenic patient, 23 years of age and he was very much in a phlegm

377
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:36,532
but now he is very much better.
I don't know if this stays.

378
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:44,450
 He does a lot of sports and he is reading books again. Before he was only in front of the TV.

379
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:47,709
From morning to evening he was seeing TV and doing nothing else.

380
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:49,759
And he is visiting friends and things.

381
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,919
-Why you gave him Tub.?

382
01:03:52,920 --> 01:04:01,280
-For several reasons. I made a repertorisation and he was very much ... discontent to everything

383
01:04:01,281 --> 01:04:08,959
and he wanted to go away and to
 commit suicide with his mother.

384
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:16,579
They were sitting by the sea side and he wanted to tell the mother to make suicide with him and things...

385
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:24,799
But do you think Tub. could cure
or could help with schizophrenia?

386
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:30,639
-No, if this is real schizophrenia, that means
 he will need other remedies as well.

387
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:36,140
But as a start it's a very good start.

388
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:46,599
 The moment that he has a relapse that is the difficult period where you have to find the next remedy.

389
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:53,840
-I give him every second day a C30.
-Good luck.
