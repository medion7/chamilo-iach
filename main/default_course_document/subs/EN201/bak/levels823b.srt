1
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,130
- What was the original?

2
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:28,110
- Compulsive tobaccoism, obesity, I don’t remember… and the pain in my back.

3
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,600
- The remedy?
- Med.

4
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:56,380
- Fear of insects, fear of spiders, cervical spasm, cannot support injustice,

5
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,040
perspiration on scalp during sleep. Is it still there?

6
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:11,130
- No. First it changed to the chest and then no more perspiration there.

7
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,730
I have perspiration now in my feet.

8
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,370
- And the perspiration is offensive?

9
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:27,220
- I could say so. It depends on the shoe that the tendency is to be…

10
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:40,480
- Sexual desire increased?
- I don’t know, I don’t practice.

11
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:52,720
- Also you had cysts in the ovaries.
- Yes.

12
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:07,230
My menses are regular now since 7 years ago it became regular but I didn’t check it any more.

13
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,380
- Before menses?

14
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:20,370
- I had amenorrhea for almost 2 years, then 6 months since I was developed at the age of 12

15
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:32,190
until 32-33 I never had menses in summertime for instance. It was very irregular.

16
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,440
- But now are regular.

17
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,440
- Are regular since I took I don’t know what remedy, because I didn’t know what I was taking,

18
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,700
because my homeopath didn’t want me to know. So some remedy switched that.

19
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,370
I never had a problem again with that.

20
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,530
- How is the cervical…?

21
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:05,450
- It was worse and worse not only the cervical but the lumbar and dorsal pain

22
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:11,620
and I couldn’t sleep as I put in the e-mail, I had to take some medication at some point

23
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,870
because I couldn’t sleep for a month. Not able to work.

24
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,360
- Did you write me?
- Yes, 3 times.

25
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,120
- And what did I suggest?

26
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,950
- You only suggest me something in the first e-mail

27
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,610
that it was “don’t take anything, maybe later I’ll give you thuja”

28
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:36,620
because the first reaction to the remedy was to be plenty of warts.

29
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,370
I was with 1 or 2 when I came here and after I took the remedy,

30
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:53,120
in less than a month all my face, my palms and in the chest also, here in the neck,

31
00:03:53,220 --> 00:04:00,450
some of them still persist but some of them were falling from the night to a day.

32
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,600
- But you did not take thuja.

33
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:17,190
- No, I took your advice at that moment then I began to face a big depression.

34
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,840
I was very depressed, very upset.

35
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,020
- Why?

36
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,420
- I’ve been through a lot as I put you in the e-mail,

37
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:38,420
a definite end of relationship with my family and my closest friend for more than 25 years

38
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,920
and I cut everything.

39
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:48,420
I shut down my practice in Uruguay. That meant about 2.000 or 3.000 patient per year.

40
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,670
And it was very hard for me to take.

41
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,420
- You stopped your practice?
- I cut everything.

42
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,170
- Why?

43
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,420
- Because I didn’t want to see my family anymore and they live in Uruguay.

44
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,420
- That means they did an injustice to you.

45
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,920
- Of course. It was happening before again and again

46
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:20,170
but I couldn’t cut the relationship because I felt guilty. Always feeling guilty.

47
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,770
- You put the guilt to you.
- Yes.

48
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:31,180
I think they manipulate me because I always put the blame on myself.

49
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,470
So that’s why I wrote to you in the first e-mail that it was outstanding to me

50
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:44,670
to be able to cut bad relationships that were toxic to me without guilt.

51
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,560
That was new in my life.

52
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:55,600
Then I realized I have a lot of symptoms of med I didn’t tell you but since I was born.

53
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,770
That was the main good effect of the remedy.

54
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,010
I didn’t understand it at that moment of the depression that it was a good thing for me,

55
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,610
in that moment I could kill myself.

56
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:23,860
But ever since I cut these relationships I’ve been better, I’m better. I feel better.

57
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:30,760
That moment was horrible when I wrote to you because my psychologist obliged me “don’t’ do it,

58
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:40,010
I’ll put you in a mental hospital to get you under anti-depressive drugs”

59
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,760
so I wrote to you because of that.

60
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,260
As I didn’t get an answer and I was in that depressive phase,

61
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,430
of course I felt you didn’t care about me…

62
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,760
- I did not answer? That’s very strange.

63
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,100
- Yes the second mail you didn’t answer, the first neither… Maybe we have a problem.

64
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:09,850
The first mail I had to ask Maria to ask you, send a mail… It does not matter but…

65
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:14,600
- Some mails are coming back because of the server, they don’t arrive.

66
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,840
- Yes, I know but in that moment I was so depressed

67
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:26,600
that the feeling was “nobody cares about me, I prefer to die, I don’t need to be in this world,

68
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,310
and painful feelings...”

69
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,000
- You did not have symptoms of ign during that time?

70
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:48,590
- I didn’t cry. I felt like I failed. My life is a failure.

71
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:56,010
That kind of feeling, I don’t belong to this world, I’m not useful to anyone,

72
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:02,120
nobody loves me and nobody will because I’m not loveable… and that kind of thoughts.

73
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:12,010
But as I told you I don’t know if it was a manic depressive wave

74
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:19,330
but after that I began to go better and better and I decided to come here.

75
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:26,600
First I went to Cuba twice to perform the “Levels of Health” course that was given there

76
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:33,080
and as I wrote down here, the first time was so depressing for me to see

77
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:44,530
that for a month I wasn’t able to stop crying because of the sympathetic feeling.

78
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:56,260
The second time I went there was 3 weeks ago. It was the same people, same country,

79
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,860
same situation, I was laughing and enjoying…

80
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,620
- It’s interesting what you are saying because everything is subjective.

81
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,760
Now you have decided to start again your practice?

82
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,030
- No. Not in Uruguay. My patients are not in Uruguay.

83
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,500
I’ve practice it because I live between 2 countries.

84
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:39,100
In Argentina 15 days then I flew to Uruguay for 15 days, where my family lives, in Uruguay.

85
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,750
My big amount of patients were in Uruguay

86
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:52,500
because there I used to work from very early in the morning until very late in the night, every day.

87
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:59,430
This is better for me, I could take a breath without working so much.

88
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:10,750
- So at this moment, psychologically you feel better.

89
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:19,090
- Better. Not well but better. I cannot be well psychologically because I feel so ugly and fat.

90
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,680
That’s a problem for me.

91
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,530
- You put on weight?

92
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:31,750
- Yes, since I came here last year in May until now I gained about 20 kilos.

93
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:41,000
That’s too much for me. I don’t want to see myself in a mirror, I’m not able to enjoy…

94
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:48,500
- Do you have great appetite or you eat…?
- I think I always had the same appetite.

95
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:56,500
I don’t if this is more than other people or no because I don’t compare myself with the others.

96
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,910
But as I told you the first time I’ve been here, something made the click inside me

97
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:12,910
and despite making diets or anything I’ve been like this the last 10 years.

98
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:24,170
But in the last 2 years it was here… The first time I gave up smoking and gained 30 kilos

99
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:32,730
and I went down then slowly and was like this for 8 years and began to smoke again.

100
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:38,230
When I began to smoke again I was both smoking and gaining weight.

101
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,580
I came here, last year with the very compulsive tobaccoism,

102
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:55,590
no less than 40 cigarettes per day… and after I gave up 4 months ago the cigarette

103
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,180
I gained another 8 kilos.

104
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,080
And I don’t know it why I gave up this time but as I told you there

105
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:16,660
I took by myself staph because I couldn’t support the pain in my back.

106
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,170
And I took empirically rhus-t without any repertorization

107
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:36,680
because it was much worse from rest and much worse from humidity, wet weather.

108
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,060
- Did you have had calc in the past?

109
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:49,160
- No, never. Maybe when I was a baby but not since I remember.

110
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:58,240
- In general you feel very cold?
- I am very cold person.

111
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,890
- And sweets?

112
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:09,980
- No, I’m not fond of sweets. Much more salt. I eat salt with food.

113
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,820
- So much. Salt with the food.
- Yes I need salt very much.

114
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,070
- What about the fat of the meat?

115
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,480
- It doesn’t bother me but it’s not something like my sister for instance,

116
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,720
she leaves the meat and she eats only fat. No, that’s not for me.

117
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:41,970
- But you can eat the fat.
- Yes if I don’t see it very clearly.

118
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,580
If I see some fat and it brings me some nausea.

119
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,060
- The eggs?
- I like it but not especially.

120
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,560
- Fruits?
- I don’t like except oranges.

121
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,310
Oranges I love. I don’t like much fruit.

122
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:07,560
I eat it because I have to eat cause I’m fat and I need to eat fruit but oranges yes.

123
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,160
I love oranges. And Greek oranges more.

124
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:22,810
- Oranges must be sweetish or sour?
- I like it sweet.

125
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,560
I also began to eat sour things because I lived in Lebanon

126
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,910
and they taught me to eat sour things and I enjoy it.

127
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,060
I didn’t tell you something maybe important.

128
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,810
The first time I came here you asked me about a breast inflammation I had

129
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,560
because I took con in the past because of this breast inflammation.

130
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,300
And this last month it came back. I’m having the same inflammation.

131
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,310
- Were it was?
- In the left breast.

132
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,890
My mother died of an inflammatory cancer of the left breast.

133
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:13,070
That was without the tumor, only the skin. The same is happening again to me.

134
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:24,980
- How many years ago you had it?
- I had in 2009.

135
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:33,020
I had it for a year and then after I took one dose of con it disappeared

136
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,370
until one month ago which came back.

137
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,260
- How is your back now?

138
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:57,330
- It’s not good because I think I overweight but after staph it is much better.

139
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,230
I repertorized that because I told you…

140
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,560
- Have you ever taken caust?
- No, never.

141
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:12,310
Only for a flu a couple of years ago caust 6CH one day because all my patients…

142
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,960
it was a kind flu.

143
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,370
- Now the coming out of the warts still continues?

144
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:39,860
- Yes. I have these and these are new… I don’t know.

145
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:47,950
Maybe one month ago it was the last one but I am telling you wasn’t one all the time.

146
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:55,350
- Is there any leucorrhea?
- No, not much.

147
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,430
- Menses are…
- Regular.

148
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:03,690
- Before menses?
- That’s new for me.

149
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,680
There’s a new symptom. I cannot stand my breast.

150
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:14,190
It is very painful and I take a lot of liquid inside my body.

151
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:24,940
So the first day I have to go each hour to the bathroom to urinate

152
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,690
because I have too much liquid. Maybe 3-4 kilos more before the menses.

153
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:36,540
This is for the last 3-4 months I’m like a medusa.

154
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:50,980
- You still have this aggravation from peaches? The fruit.

155
00:17:52,820 --> 00:18:00,470
- I don’t have it anymore because this summertime they were very good and I ate a lot.

156
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:08,360
Nothing happened to my face. I comment that to my friend, I remember.

157
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,760
- This desire for smoke now is still there?

158
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,970
- It went away and it came back since I am in Greece. One week.

159
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:26,820
I went and bought some cigarettes. Stupid I know. I couldn’t help it really.

160
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:36,700
- Also you have said that you had aversion to alcoholic drinks?

161
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,800
- Yes still there. Very strong.

162
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,530
- And the sea bathing? The experience?

163
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:54,770
- It’s the best thing in the world. If you put me there to live, I live there.

164
00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:00,310
- Inside the sea…
- Here it is very cold.

165
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:08,650
I am a very cold person but in Cuba that is hot they had to remove me from the sea in the night

166
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:14,760
because I was there from morning till the night. I didn’t want to move from inside the sea.

167
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:24,380
- So the potency that you took in the beginning…

168
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:31,730
- Yes Med was one day 200CH a dose and the other 1M.

169
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,630
- And you never repeated?

170
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:41,230
- Never repeated. Only took this staph in the middle because my pain was killing me.

171
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,050
- You are cold you say?
- Very cold.

172
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:55,900
- Your feet are cold?
- Yes… are like ice

173
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,300
- Your nails are strong?

174
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,300
- No, after I took the remedy, that’s another thing, I used to have very strong nails and long,

175
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,510
and I cannot…never again.

176
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:17,570
- Now they break.
- Yes that was a change.

177
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,310
- Is there any kind of tendency for constipation?

178
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:33,380
- I am alternating from constipation to diarrhea no matter what I eat.

179
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,880
- All your life or now?
- No I think it’s the last period.

180
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:42,950
Maybe with some of this unknown medication I took.

181
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:47,950
I reported this kind of thing for 15 days but nothing happened.

182
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:57,530
But now I am having problems with my rectum first, the fissure that doesn’t go.

183
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,880
That is persistent since I took the medication, doesn’t go.

184
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:14,290
I used to have sometimes because I was constipated once but it used to be cured.

185
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:19,530
This is worse before menses but I am always bleeding.

186
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:25,040
There is no stool without bleeding. No matter the consistency.

187
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,700
- You did not experience any problems with your stomach?

188
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:47,940
- Yes. I was very bad and I still am with acid reflux. Burning. Reflux in the night.

189
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:54,800
And maybe I wake up because of this, coughing because of broncho-aspiration.

190
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:04,470
That’s a problem. I thought it was because of the cigarette but after gave up smoking

191
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,020
it was still there.

192
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,890
- Did you notice any problems with the nails on your foot?

193
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,670
- Yes.

194
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,980
- Entering?

195
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:27,890
- What are you? A magician? The right toe yes. You surprise me, really!

196
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,210
- I am not a magician. I have just studied very much…

197
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,220
- That’s why I am here. Because you told me so.

198
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,810
If not, if I thought you were a magician I wouldn’t be here.

199
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,060
I want to study so much and know so much.

200
00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:00,070
First when I came you even guessed my hormone levels.

201
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:09,220
- In your background pathology you have mentioned hypothyroidism,

202
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:15,070
that was confirmed…? All of your life?

203
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,460
- Not all my life. I was like this.

204
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:26,050
I was being in a very strict diet, very hypo caloric about 400 kcal per day for 2 years.

205
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,880
After that I was skinny of course

206
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:37,380
but I couldn’t go to the beach 36C outside without my wool things. So I performed TSH.

207
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:48,730
And my TSH level was 12. It was very high. I think it was because of that diet

208
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:55,960
because this diet it is like fashion diet in Argentina

209
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,970
because there is some physician in the TV that gives this horrible diet

210
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:08,300
many people perform that and I had patients and they all after hypothyroid.

211
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,560
Of course 400 kcal for 2 years you must save energy some way

212
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,300
and I think that was the cost.

213
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,130
- What age?

214
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:25,630
- The diet that put on my weight again after I gave up smoking…

215
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:36,470
So it was 2003 more or less. 2004. That means 35-36 years old.

216
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:08,630
Now what we can say about this case that med has done quite a good job

217
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:18,620
and the reason for that is mostly the externalization of these tumors,

218
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:32,620
all these little warts all over the body which is a big release of the organism of course.

219
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:41,220
And prevention of the tumor developing more serious later on.

220
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:47,160
So the fact that the organism brings out all these warts

221
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:59,450
is a kind of protection of the organism for not developing tumor in the internal organs.

222
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,850
That’s the one.

223
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:18,700
There are several changes of course and the changes point out to the same remedy

224
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:26,310
or to another remedy or to which remedy…? This is the question.

225
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:40,550
There are changes which are deep you see the changes that you see for instance in the nails.

226
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:50,200
That means the calcium is not anymore distributed equally,

227
00:26:50,300 --> 00:27:01,290
normally in the body and that’s why the nails start breaking down.

228
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:09,200
This is something which is not important, it seems not important

229
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:18,210
but for the organism is shows a deep change in the absorption process.

230
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:29,610
Therefore it shows that the calcium is not working properly

231
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:40,790
and that’s why I was asking questions concerning calc with the obesity, with the freezing…

232
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:57,940
I was thinking of calc, another remedy you could be thinking with the fissure is graph

233
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:10,840
which again has strong obesity the problem is that graph has aversion to salt.

234
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,380
Aversion to sweets and salt.

235
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:30,610
So the decision has to be between calc, graph and a third one sil.

236
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,450
So I am not a magician when I ask her.

237
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:57,360
The question was your organism goes towards a sil picture?

238
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:06,610
She just confirmed it, she said “My nails started ingrowing, going inside”.

239
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:15,020
Because I had several other things which were going on pointing to sil

240
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:24,110
and the extreme coldness that she feels is sil.

241
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:34,510
Also sil is the fact that the perspiration went away, went to the feet and became offensive.

242
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:43,820
So all the changes she has point to sil with one difference.

243
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:52,750
That sil has desire for salt but is not known for such a strong desire for salt.

244
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:12,140
But the problem is that she has developed also an inflammation of the mammae

245
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:21,170
which we have to take care of.  And the inflammation of the mammae…

246
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,510
show me the remedies.

247
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:36,250
You see sil, graph, calc. The system is quite intelligent more than me.

248
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:48,000
That’s why they say you are going to produce robots that will be better than humans.

249
00:30:49,500 --> 00:31:00,170
This is the case. Show me inflammation of the mammae.

250
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:29,590
We see here the calc, should be quite strong here, sil is on the third degree where graph is missing.

251
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:40,730
So in spite of the fact the obesity is like graph,

252
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:49,840
she looks like graph still sil is covering more her picture.

253
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:58,480
Because graph very seldom will describe themselves as so freezing as she did.

254
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:09,570
Freezing cold. Graph is cold but not to the extreme. Sil is extremely cold.

255
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:20,410
Feeling the cold very strongly. Complaints from anticipation.

256
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:39,910
I saw her expecting… She has to go to the bathroom. So I added this symptoms.

257
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:51,320
It’s not important but it’s interesting that both sil and graph they have strongly this symptom.

258
00:32:52,250 --> 00:33:07,160
What we see here is a little bit strange phenomenon that still has some keynotes of med

259
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:12,260
like desire for oranges and better in the sea.

260
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:23,990
I am not sure if better in the sea will be as strong as it was this summer.

261
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:32,150
- In Cuba I thought it was the weather, that was wet.

262
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,890
But it was much worse I was rigid, couldn’t move mostly in the morning.

263
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:45,360
The other things were better in the sea like my mood but this was worse.

264
00:33:50,620 --> 00:34:09,580
- Anyhow the fissure also is characteristic of sil as well as graph of course

265
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:24,810
but what differentiates the sil from graph in her case is the extreme aggravation from cold

266
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:36,340
on the one hand and on the other the inflammation which has and has to be taken care

267
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:42,490
of which is not known so much with graph.

268
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,540
Where with sil it’s well established.

269
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:59,120
So therefore sil 200CH one dose you can take it and you can tell me tomorrow.

270
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:19,770
- My question is about the warts; if understood correct they are still coming

271
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:27,680
and is it not an indication to wait because the process is like going on

272
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,890
but on the other hand there is this inflammation of mammae

273
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:39,880
which is really something serious to look for because there is the hereditary background.

274
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:49,770
- The remedy med was taken one year ago. So we have waited for a year.

275
00:35:49,870 --> 00:36:02,370
Now we have a new picture. Quite deep changes to show us that most probably this is the remedy.

276
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,130
We are justified to give the remedy.

277
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:15,870
Because we have enough new symptoms after the changes which point out to sil.

278
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:30,520
- I have a question. A while ago she took homeo for breast inflammation,

279
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,200
was it a good thing or was it a suppression?
- I don’t know.

280
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:49,850
- … Because you made an explanation why I haven’t had sexual activity for a lot of years

281
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:56,600
and that was not good for my type of passionate Mediterranean…

282
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:04,690
and that made the hormones to accumulate and prepared for a tumor.

283
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:13,250
And that was a good thing. You congratulate because I took con last year.

284
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,770
-  That means it was correct.

285
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:30,950
That means also that the organism has more or less under the same pressure.

286
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:44,690
She has no partner and sexually she is active and there is a kind of outlet in the inflammation.

287
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,390
We’ll see now with sil. What happens.

288
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:58,190
One remedy has cured one symptom does not mean another remedy

289
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:01,530
may not cure the same symptom of course.

290
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:09,120
But now sil is chosen on a much more global basis.

291
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:15,620
With a lot of more symptoms. Can you tell me?

292
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:33,600
There is question written here in the acon case… Ok.

293
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:45,160
She says she would not have thought treating it as an acute the acon case

294
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,690
because there was no fever.

295
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:58,910
I said the shock is like an acute not meaning fever.

296
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:09,510
But meaning an acute like to fall down and you are blue. This is an acute.

297
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:20,670
You take arn and it goes away. Now if you leave it and the blow has remained in the organism

298
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:30,270
it will become an obstacle for the underlying remedy unless you give arn.

299
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:40,200
You had a case in which there was an accident, hit the head or the body

300
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:50,200
and the effect of the accident was not treated correctly. The effect remained.

301
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:56,250
Now he comes and he doesn’t not have the pains of the accident

302
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:01,250
but he has different other symptoms.

303
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:10,260
You think it’s calc, you prescribe, no effect. Graph, no effect, sil, no effect.

304
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:17,750
And then you give arn because you go back and you say this blow has remained

305
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:27,590
and this level of the blow that was imposed upon the organism at a certain moment

306
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:32,680
keeps the organism slaved.

307
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:40,670
You have to free the organism from this layer and then the calc will act.

308
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:57,170
It’s clear… This is what I mean by acute in this case. Yes.

309
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:07,580
- ..Because you saw the person was in group C.

310
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,080
What would have happened? Do you know?

311
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,800
- If the person was in the group C…

312
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:17,910
- If you didn’t recognize that the person was in group C…

313
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,060
what would have happened? Do you know…?

314
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:32,650
- When I say acute in the groups I mean fever. Now there was not fever…

315
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:49,550
If you give low potency still there will be some effect

316
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:55,150
but not as big effect as a high potency.

317
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:04,050
Because that was a mental state. An acute of the mental condition.

318
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:10,400
So it’s not a fever on the body it’s on the mental. So you have to go high.

319
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,930
Thank you.
