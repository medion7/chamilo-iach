1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:16,820
- We can start. You read this report yourself.

2
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,220
- My daughter was born in October 2011 by caesarian operation

3
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,470
because the delivery was very long, non-progressing

4
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,470
and the contraction was slowly subsiding.

5
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,570
After 12 hours the physician decided for an operation.

6
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,470
- You speak too fast. Slowly please.
- Ok.

7
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,820
After 12 hours the physician decided for operation.

8
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:58,900
She was born according to schedule 3,95 kg APGAR score 9/9/10. She was symptom free.

9
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:08,220
Except few café au lait spots but nobody told us that anything is wrong with her.

10
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:15,710
The café au lait spots became more visible and their amount gradually increases.

11
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:21,450
- How many café au lait spots she has now?
- About 50.

12
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,300
- They’re increasing every month.

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:37,300
- Yes. After 2 months she had about 50 café au lait spots, I think now it’s more.

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,350
We didn’t count.

15
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,390
- But you saw some more, some new.
- Yes.

16
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:55,280
After 2 months she had about café au lait spots and we started to search “what is it?”

17
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,520
and we found out that it could be sign of neurofibromatosis type 1

18
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:08,960
which is calling also von Recklinghausen syndrome.

19
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:23,690
Then the neurologist confirmed this diagnosis according to the specific symptoms

20
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:30,690
which are multiple café au lait spots and frecklings of a specific kind.

21
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:37,690
He also found out that the head of our daughter has very slight tendency

22
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:53,660
to fall to the right side but it was 2 months ago and now it seems to be good.

23
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,500
It was very slight it was not something serious.

24
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:05,650
And neurologist said he was not sure if it’s part of the disease or if it is normal

25
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:14,010
because it was so slight… Normal in this age.

26
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,660
According to him it might be but it doesn’t have to be a symptom of this disease.

27
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,740
Also we found her left leg about 1cm longer than the right.

28
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,740
This disease does not have a specific picture in every patient

29
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,730
and can have all kind of troubles. Some patients have signs which are very mild

30
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,990
but other may develop very serious problems.

31
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:49,340
The child is psychologically very good, very calm, very happy and always smiling.

32
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:56,240
The only problem from the very beginning was that she had problems falling asleep

33
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,840
just in the evening.

34
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,980
- She has a problem? What is the problem? Not falling asleep?

35
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,740
- Yes. She cries.

36
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,340
- She cannot fall asleep in the afternoon?
- Just evening.

37
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,440
- She cannot fall asleep at night?
- Yes.

38
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,940
- She cannot fall asleep that means she stays awake and cries.

39
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,340
- Also in the early months she was extremely sensitive to noises

40
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:38,510
that caused frightening and screaming. I gave her just one remedy, carc.

41
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,020
Because of sleeplessness in the evening

42
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,480
and because we both have family anamnesis of cancer.

43
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:54,480
My father developed cancer in 45, the mother of my wife developed cancer in her 40s.

44
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:06,820
Both of our parents had skin cancer and I gave her a carc. 1M and it was in February.

45
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:17,800
After carc 1M she had 2 days aggravation of the mood, she was screaming

46
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:27,550
and after that the sleeping was good. Until now she is sleeping, there is no problem.

47
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,980
But the café au lait spots are multiplying.

48
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:40,750
- Also she developed this lump on her head, we don’t know what it is that.

49
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:50,100
- Maybe wart, we don’t know. Nobody saw it. It is very small.

50
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:56,600
- A little growth.
- You can see it.

51
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,100
- It’s like a hard pimple.

52
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,670
- But it doesn’t disappear for a month and a half it’s still there.

53
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,420
- It grows?

54
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,670
- No. But with her condition we are not sure…

55
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,770
- You’re afraid.
- Yes.

56
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,190
- She is good otherwise?
- Yes, she is lovely, she is nice.

57
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:40,490
- No restlessness, she loves people, no problem. But here in Alonissos

58
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,900
because maybe it’s the change of the environment, she is more…

59
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,260
- She screams but is not… She just likes to scream I don’t know why.

60
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,220
- She is smiling and now… without reason, you know…

61
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:08,400
- She cries?
- No, very rarely. Only when she is hungry.

62
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:15,740
- A lot of salivation?
- No. Only when she has teething.

63
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,650
- She likes to eat everything? What does she eat?

64
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,800
- Everything that she grabs she puts it in her mouth.

65
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:36,700
- You breast feed her?
- Not anymore. I did it for 2 months.

66
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:46,530
- Why?
- I didn’t have enough milk, so we gave her more…

67
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,120
- Baby powder milk with water.

68
00:07:51,370 --> 00:08:00,120
- That’s all she has. Egg? You give her any egg?
- No.

69
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:10,030
- Any fruits?
- Yes, apples or bananas.

70
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:18,280
She likes sweet more. She eats anything we give her actually.

71
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,610
I gave her a lemon the other day and she ate it. Just to taste it…

72
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:30,110
- She was screaming and during the lunch… My wife was just “take the lemon”

73
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,210
and she calmed with the lemon.

74
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:45,860
- But she may be calm with anything. She likes to taste things. But lemon was interesting.

75
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:53,660
- You tried lemon again to see if…
- No, she licked the lemon like it is…

76
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,260
- She enjoyed it.
- Yes.

77
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:05,850
- Very strange. Which leg is longer, the left?
- Yes.

78
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,490
- Perspiration during sleep?
- Not specific.

79
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:25,250
Sometimes when she is in the cradle and it’s hot she is really very very perspirated in the neck,

80
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,590
but normally not. It’s not a rule.

81
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,250
- I know when she wants to sleep, it’s only at night or in the evening,

82
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,990
she puts her thumb in her ear and scratches her ear.

83
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:46,110
You can see that her ears are… there is a little bit of blood because she does this.

84
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,850
- Itching in the ear, on the left?
- Both ears.

85
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,240
- This is only at night or during the day time too?

86
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,930
- Only at night when she wants to fall asleep.

87
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,330
- The fontanelles are closed?

88
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:23,690
- Not fully but she is 7 months old so it’s not…

89
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,830
- And also she has this… in her head. Our doctor said it’s normal but…

90
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:37,680
- These red spots. Now it’s disappearing slowly.

91
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:53,340
- We go inside to discuss the case.

92
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,930
- Ok. Can I be there?
- Yes.

93
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:29,340
Ok, which is the remedy? She has one symptom, itching in the ear. That’s all.

94
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,350
So we prescribe a remedy for itching in the ear.

95
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:48,660
The analysis is very short because I don’t want to bother you. Carc. was correct,

96
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,180
that was 2 months ago. The child is sleeping well.

97
00:11:52,280 --> 00:12:01,660
The main problem with the child was sleeplessness, irritability before falling asleep.

98
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,660
It shows the whole imbalance in the organism as far as symptoms are concerned,

99
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:16,650
it was only the brown spots and the disturbance in the sleep

100
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,650
which we could use as guiding symptoms.

101
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,470
Due to the hereditary predisposition.

102
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:35,980
He gave carc and carc is supposed to have produced these café au lait spots

103
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:43,470
and therefore carc is correct and we must not change it. We must not touch this case.

104
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:59,660
If you touch it, you can make a damage. You’re disappointed. That’s it.

105
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,380
What may happen is that after some time, after a few months,

106
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:14,480
a year or so the child will develop some indications, some symptoms

107
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,470
that can guide us to the next remedy.

108
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:26,570
But to touch her with a remedy while we are in the dark, it is stupid, we should not do it.

109
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:36,470
It doesn’t matter how much the mother or the father pressurize you to give a remedy,

110
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,770
you give placebos.

111
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:48,720
- Can I ask you, the fact that the café au lait spots are increasing…

112
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:55,220
- It’s a good sign because it’s the externalization of the problem.

113
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:05,230
So maybe she will go through with a mild type of the problem.

114
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:13,980
Don’t worry, it will stop and eventually after 6 months to 1 year they will stop coming down

115
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:23,150
and becoming less and less prominent. I hope everything will be well without any more...

116
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,730
But we are in touch.
