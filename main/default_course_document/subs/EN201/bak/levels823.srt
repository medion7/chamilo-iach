1
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,220
-Tell me what is the main problem.

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:24,860
-The main problem is tobaccoism and obesity of course as secondary problem

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,110
because every time I try to quite up smoking.

4
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,620
I gained many many kilos in a few time.

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:45,150
Maybe in a month or two I can gain more than 10 kilos. Not for eating more quantity.

6
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,200
-Same food and you put on weight.
-Yes.

7
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,540
-Immediately. With tobacco. Cervical ailments.

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,540
-There was a problem and because of that I was not coming to Greece.

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:11,200
Because it was very painful. But thank God I find an osteopath and he put my…

10
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,490
-Straight.
-Yes and was perfect.

11
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:22,430
Because with a lot of paraesthesia and pain. I couldn’t work, I was rigid for many days.

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,170
-This was the first time that happened?
-No.

13
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,410
That big picture yes as I told you but from my childhood until now

14
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:40,880
it’s very frequent for me to have this kind of contractors and pain.

15
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,020
-You mean cervical region?
-Yes.

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,780
At the end it’s all paraesthesias in my feet, had paraesthesias in the hand,

17
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,330
paraesthesias in different parts…

18
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:02,750
-You mean contracture?
-No. It is the sensation of… formication…

19
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:11,480
-Numbness. 
-Some times sensitive-less.

20
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,560
-How is your spine?
-It was contracted. Because…

21
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:25,820
- Did you have an x-ray?
- No, MRI.

22
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:36,650
First I had the atlas displaced, the whole of the head was like this with the atlas.

23
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,600
That was the problem when they put it ok in one day I was  fantastic like never…

24
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:51,150
And every day better and better… Until I get clear. I only have remaining here.

25
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,500
The sensation…

26
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:08,730
- But before this crisis of the cervical… you were feeling good?

27
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:17,160
- I think I had emotional concerns. This kind of crisis.

28
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,900
First it was contraction and it aggravated the mechanical problem.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,150
- Because of emotional problems.
- Yes.

30
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:33,650
Every time I get disappointed or frustrated I become very contracted.

31
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,980
I am rigid to this kind of things and I react against that.

32
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,900
- Disappointed. You mean emotionally?
- Yes.

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,740
- Mostly or only emotionally?
- Everything is emotional for me.

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:05,650
- You have aversion to alcohol? Since many years.
- Yes, since I was born.

35
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:23,740
- You lack an enzyme, most probably. Mother died 58, breast cancer and father 70 years old.

36
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,820
But you had pancreatitis?
- When I was a child.

37
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:41,170
Because my sister had measles and at that time I made a pancreatitis.

38
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:50,070
- Chronic eczema. Where?
- I have it here. Lateral of the fingers.

39
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:55,260
- Between the fingers.
- And in the feet too.

40
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:04,920
- And you had warts?
- Yes I have some look. Like this…

41
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:20,670
- Mumps at 18 years old. Cyst in the ovary. When did you find this? What age?

42
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:29,920
- I found it when I began studying medicine. I think 20 years ago.

43
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,820
- Do you have children?
- No I don’t.

44
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,320
- You are married?
- No I’m not.

45
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,920
- Why?
- I don’t know. You tell me.

46
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:50,940
I didn’t find a person or he didn’t find me or I’m too difficult person.

47
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,980
- But you had some affairs? 
- Yes. Not many.

48
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:04,740
I had one big relationship 10 years ago. And it lasted 10 years.

49
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,230
- What kind of relation?
- He was my boyfriend but we lived together.

50
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,850
- You didn’t marry.
- Yes we never got married.

51
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,040
- But you never had sex?
- Yes! I had.

52
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:27,450
- When did you start having sex?
- 22-23 years old maybe 24.

53
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:33,210
- Were you infected by any of these partners?
- No, I don’t think so.

54
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,700
- You have a strong personality.
- Yes.

55
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,110
- Most probably. And men do not like it.
- They don’t. And I cannot change it.

56
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,040
- Is this the reason?
- I think so.

57
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:06,450
- Syndrome Stein- Leventhal.
- This is because of the multiple cysts.

58
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:10,030
- This prevented you from becoming pregnant or you always…

59
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:15,620
- I think so because I didn’t use any anti-conceptive method within 10 years

60
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:25,120
with this only partner. And after me he had a child so… I thought he was sterile.

61
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,210
But it was me probably.

62
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,780
- Gastritis still continues?

63
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,520
- Sometimes because now I am smoking again and because of the cigarette I have...

64
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,630
- Burning.
- Yes.

65
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:51,530
But especially with emotional detonants. I get angry, frustrated and then…

66
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,190
- Do you get very angry sometimes?

67
00:07:53,290 --> 00:08:02,450
- Yes. Every day, every time, every minute of my life but…

68
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:09,690
- The remedies you have taken are sil…
- Sil was in my childhood.

69
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,690
- And polypharmacy?
- Yes.

70
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:20,540
My homeopath became holist and he gave me Bach flower, everything mixed.

71
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:28,450
- Merc, nux-v, con, nat-c. Only these remedies you have taken?

72
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:34,450
- Maybe some more but I don’t know then because partners of me were my doctors

73
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:39,050
and I didn’t want to know neither they told me about it.

74
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:59,860
Con was because of some syndrome. For 6 months I had some pathology in my breast.

75
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,860
My left breast, like my mother had. The diagnosis to my mother I made it myself

76
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:12,360
because nobody could tell that was cancer. I knew it was.

77
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,770
And it is a very strange kind of cancer.

78
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,290
It’s like erysipelas, inflammation, in the skin only.

79
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,520
And many biopsies… and nothing happened, many tomographies… nothing.

80
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:32,730
But I knew it was a cancer and finally I had it. For 6 months 3 years ago

81
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,180
I had this kind of symptom.

82
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,160
- The same thing.

83
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:42,610
- Yes and then I asked an homeopath in that time and she gave me con.

84
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:49,710
I didn’t know what I was taking before I came I learned it was con.

85
00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:01,460
But in 6 hours it took that symptom away. I remember it. Most outstanding.

86
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:15,690
- There is a mass in breast, you feel? Or there is some hardening…

87
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,020
- No, nodules.

88
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:25,020
- No nodules. The area which is inflamed.
- No I think it was all the breast.

89
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:36,710
The skin was like orange. Like a kind of cellulitis and the nipple was always erected.

90
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,360
Every time, every day for 6 months.

91
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:46,940
- You are talking about your mother?
- No. My mother became like that and me too.

92
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:58,200
- And you had the same. And you are now 42.
- Yes but that was when I was 39.

93
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:09,550
- And this… Breast started when you were 39.
- But it went away with con.

94
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:17,280
I took the con I didn’t know what I was taking and in the afternoon I went to sleep.

95
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,870
Every night it was very painful to sleep for me because it hurt really.

96
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:29,870
And in the morning I was without anything. I couldn’t believe. And never came.

97
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,690
- Con helped you in general as well?

98
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:40,450
- Yes but I stopped taking it because of 2 things.

99
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:47,030
First, I developed a bronchospasm that I never had before.

100
00:11:47,130 --> 00:12:00,140
And second I had a bad situation for me that was this burn-out syndrome.

101
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:11,530
I burned my head. And I couldn’t work, was so depressed and I stopped taking this,

102
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:19,880
I repertorized myself and then began with nux-v and this took me away from this symptom.

103
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,530
- Nat-c helped you?

104
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,780
- I took only 1 or 2 doses because I was like this as I told you before coming.

105
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,630
I didn’t want to take anything because I was coming here. But I think it helped me.

106
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,630
- Have you taken Ign?
- Never. Not even when my mother died.

107
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:55,970
- Did you cry with your mother?
- A lot. I still cry.

108
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,190
- You can drink milk?
- Yes I can.

109
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:10,130
- You like.
- I don’t like the most but I can.

110
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:18,720
- What do you like the most?
- The most? Meat. Cow meat only.

111
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:36,610
Not any type of meat. And salt. I put salt on everything. I eat salt with food not food with salt.

112
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,470
- Is so much? 
- So much.

113
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,970
- What about sour?
- I like them. Not especially.

114
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,230
- You are affected by the sun?
- Yes. For good. Sun relives me.

115
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:05,230
It’s the only thing that keeps me healthy in mind and in body.

116
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:14,190
I need sun. So I get depressed every winter. If I don’t take long summer vacation…

117
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,360
- You live in Buenos Aires?

118
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:22,930
- Half in Buenos Aires, half in Montevideo, Uruguay. I work both sides.

119
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:25,260
- But in both countries there is a lot of sun.

120
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:34,250
- Yes there is. And in winter I come to Europe so I can…

121
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,650
- You live with your father now?

122
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:51,000
- No since I was 17 I live alone. For 10 years I lived with my partner / couple.

123
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,660
- You have bleeding hemorrhoids? 
- Yes.

124
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:06,660
- And you have hypothyroidism confirmed.
- Yes only in the lab test.

125
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:15,340
- But you feel cold in general.
- I am very cold person.

126
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,310
- You never took calc?

127
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:27,840
- I don’t think so. Maybe in this blind… but I don’t remember.

128
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,990
- The polypharmacy…
- Yes.

129
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,110
- You feel cold in general or in the extremities?

130
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:45,810
- I always have the extremities cold and I feel cold and I cannot get warm.

131
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:53,560
For instance last night I was with the air conditioner in 30 degrees all night and 3 coats

132
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,570
and my pajamas and I was cold all the night.

133
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,160
- You put the air condition on warm.
- Always.

134
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:16,560
- So much cold. And do you sometimes perspire around this area.

135
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:24,310
- Not much. Maybe if I am exercising and it’s very warm maybe some…

136
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:29,660
- In sleep.
- No I don’t think so. I never get wet.

137
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:39,910
- You sleep with socks?
- Not now. For a time I was sleeping with socks.

138
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:48,310
- You have some fears?
- Yes.

139
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:59,560
Maybe storms, I don’t like rain either I feel awful. Before the storm…

140
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,150
- Because of the wetness or…

141
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:08,150
- I don’t know because it’s mental, emotional and physical.

142
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:15,310
Before rain comes I know in my hair, I know in my bones.

143
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,650
And every says in the TV it is going to be a sunny day and I say it’s going to rain

144
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:27,320
because I feel this anguish inside. I feel it will rain for sure.

145
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:34,820
I put my sign on it. Because my body and mind feels it’s coming.

146
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:40,750
- So you can be employed in the meteo…
- For sure.

147
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,570
- Have you checked your hormones to check how your testosterone is?

148
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,310
- It’s high.

149
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:08,810
- Very high?
- How do you know?

150
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:12,500
- I’ve been doing this 50 years.
- Yes, I’m sorry.

151
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:29,250
- When did you have this syndrome with the breast?

152
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:41,900
- It was 2008. I remember because my sister was about to get married and I was the godmother.

153
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,150
Because my mother wasn’t and she picked me for that.

154
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:55,650
And I started thinking that has something to do with this and my mother’s…

155
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:00,410
like choose… I don’t know.

156
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:11,900
- 2008. You said you had a relationship running 6-7 years by that time.

157
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:32,230
- 10 years ago. I ended it in 2000. From 1990-2000.

158
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,480
- That was the longest but after this .

159
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:44,240
- Nothing important. I couldn’t get in love again.

160
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,480
- That means you suppressed yourself as far as sexual desire concern…

161
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,490
- For sure. Cause I didn’t have sex.

162
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:56,490
- So you had to suppress yourself actually.

163
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:05,730
- Not in a conscious way but I was like… hypersexuality.

164
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:11,490
I used to be, that’s my tendency. I am very passionate in everything.

165
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:19,820
This has been in studies if you have much sex you need more

166
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,920
and if you have less you need less.

167
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:33,580
- The one that gave you the con knew that you did not have sex for several years?

168
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,330
- I don’t know.

169
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:39,120
- Do you remember if you told her or she just gave you…

170
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,070
- No she gave me not for that. She gave me the con because of the breast symptom

171
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:50,820
and because I had a horrible syndrome because to be more concentrated

172
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:58,830
and for everything I had to play on the computer. Any kind of playing. I need that.

173
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,320
- You need to play in order to concentrate.

174
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:09,400
- Many teachers got offended by me because during the class I played solitaire.

175
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,230
Many people here laughed at me when they saw me but I need that.

176
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:19,740
When a patient is very difficult I put the solitaire.

177
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,320
- What is this solitaire?

178
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:29,290
- The card play they have it in Windows. But any kind of play.

179
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,640
I need to play…
- In order to concentrate.

180
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,890
Do you sometimes have clairvoyant…

181
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,490
- No I don’t think so. Only with my mother thing…

182
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:01,640
- Is there any other fear? Fear of the dark?

183
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:14,640
- Not of the dark. Fear of all kinds of insects, the flying ones and the spiders.I can die.

184
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:24,910
If you put me that kind of butterfly that eats clothes, that are bigger,

185
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,640
I don’t know if you have it here I can die.

186
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,640
Many times I walk outside of my home in the middle of the night

187
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:45,620
and  I stay until some neighbor comes and kills it because I can die. Spiders also.

188
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:59,370
I am very afraid of spiders. And I cannot watch horror movies. I don’t like.

189
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,980
I get very frightened.

190
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,110
- Sweets, you like?

191
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:15,380
- I like not mostly. I cannot eat without salt. That’s for sure.

192
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,700
- Have you checked your blood pressure?

193
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,450
- Yes. It’s always low. Very. 70 top.

194
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:39,640
90 if I have hypertension. 70 is the max.  I have 70-90/60 or 50.

195
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:49,890
- Have you ever had fainted?
- No. Never. I don’t remember.

196
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,630
- Have you taken calc?
- I don’t think so.

197
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,740
- Phos?

198
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:10,780
- Yes phos because I injured myself with a patient with blood,

199
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:17,780
of course not wanted to, it was an accident and I began to take the drugs in the hospital

200
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,040
they obliged me to.

201
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,120
It was awful and I called my homeopath and said “What can I do

202
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,700
because I will not take these.”

203
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:35,200
And he gave me a lot of homeopathic remedies one for Tuesday, one for Wednesday…

204
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,880
And one of them was Phos.

205
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:43,130
- Stram?
- I don’t think so.

206
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,630
- Verat?
- I don’t think so.

207
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:53,210
- Carb-v?
- I don’t think so.

208
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:17,120
- You like smoked meat?
- No smokes. I like asado.

209
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:26,560
In Argentina they make it on fire but not the smokey taste. I don’t like it.

210
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,850
- You had always headaches but now you have only before menses?

211
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,560
- Yes.

212
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:47,890
- How is your menses? 
- It was very Irregular.

213
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:56,970
They are very long lasting in time. Maybe 12, 14 days menses.

214
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:03,010
In this period I have very small quantity in the beginning and at the end

215
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:09,850
and I have 5 or 7 days with a lot of blood.

216
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:26,500
- Nat-m?
- I was thinking of it. I never took it.

217
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:35,270
Thinking of it before nat-c and because of that I took nat-c for this contraction.

218
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:55,510
- Your sleep is good? 
- Lately I think I am not sleeping too much.

219
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:01,760
I am activating at night and of course I have to wake up early

220
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:11,360
but if I could run on I will… for sure I will sleep more.

221
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:23,590
- Your companion was from the same country as you are?

222
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,020
- Argentina yes.

223
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,170
- But you are not an Argentinian?

224
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:37,280
- I was born in Argentina but my origin is… My father Lebanese, my mother Italian.

225
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:47,270
- A very explosive mixture.
- I know. My friends suffer it.

226
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:55,500
- When was it the last time you had a high fever?

227
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,100
- High fever, more than 38 you mean,

228
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,870
Long, long time ago.

229
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,260
- Do you go to the sea? You like the sea?

230
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,840
- Very much. It’s my life. It gives me life. I need the sea.

231
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,690
- Have ever taken med?
- No.

232
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,760
- The position you sleep?
- I think it’s mostly left side.

233
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:48,060
- But you can sleep in other position?
- Yes I can sleep even in the abdomen.

234
00:28:50,560 --> 00:29:01,010
- Do you eat fruits?
- I have to eat it. I never prefer.

235
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:11,170
- Pork you don’t eat because of the…
- I don’t like it.

236
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,450
- Because of religion?

237
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:20,170
- No because I don’t like it. But I eat ham, it’s from pork.

238
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:29,280
- You write here multiple keratosis actinic.

239
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:35,240
-This you cannot see because I have it well covered but I have a lot here.

240
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,220
- Are they like warts?

241
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,560
- First brown spots, then they become higher.

242
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:56,720
- Excrescences. 
- Yes this kind of things.

243
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,530
Here you do not see all but I have it in all my body.

244
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,540
- Not warts really?

245
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,540
- They call it dermo… dermatologically speaking.

246
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,210
But mostly they beginning from actinic keratosis I think. It’s from the sun.

247
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,040
Because I like so much the sun and I never take care…

248
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,790
- Have you shown it to a dermatologist?
- Yes.

249
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,290
- Is any of the malignant?

250
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:29,910
- No but of course he’s that I have to take care and I don’t.

251
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:47,620
- Do you have brothers or sisters?
- Yes I have 2 sisters. One brother.

252
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,470
- They are married?
- All of them.

253
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:58,220
- My brother he has a boyfriend. He is going to get married next year.

254
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:03,370
- But they don’t worry that you don’t get married?

255
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:11,620
- I don’t think. I think are more afraid of me.

256
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,380
We don’t have nowadays a good relationship with my family.

257
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,970
Neither with my father nor with my brother and sister.

258
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,370
- You are easily excitable. Easily getting mad.

259
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:30,220
- I get mad easily because of strong causes.

260
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:41,210
For instance I felt betrayed by my family. I tell you one example. There are a lot.

261
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:48,290
One example is my mother died 10 years ago I signed to give to them everything

262
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:55,290
only I would have a small flat in Buenos Aires in which I live but there were more things.

263
00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:02,840
I left to them in exchange for that because I wasn’t interested in having anything.

264
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:10,250
This was 10 years ago. Now they are asking me to give them the money of this small flat.

265
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,940
So injustice for me. Not only for me, for the others.

266
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:24,010
There’s so much indignation that comes to me that I can kill.

267
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:38,160
- From the fruits which one would you say “I like the best”?

268
00:32:38,260 --> 00:33:04,590
- Strawberries, orange and tangerine. I eat pears. And stop counting.

269
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:11,340
I eat the others but I like these. Because I have to.

270
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,850
I don’t like grapes, I don’t like bananas, like tropical fruits not…

271
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:26,530
- Ok.
- Ok? I go?

272
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,680
- You’re free.
- Thank you.

273
00:33:41,490 --> 00:34:00,970
Ok we have to speak about this case, this nice Argentinian- Lebanese case.

274
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:24,040
Many of you know the remedy. I want to see who knows the remedy. Only one?

275
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,400
No, I don’t believe it.

276
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:34,960
Who knows the remedy? You are shy, you are afraid if you say the remedy

277
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:40,560
and then it’s not correct then you will have a problem.

278
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:53,720
No, you will not have a problem. The idea is when someone thinks of a remedy

279
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:00,310
to know the reasons why he proposed that remedy.

280
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:07,470
He can say “I think the remedy is this because of this and that reason”.

281
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:13,040
If you say it like this you are always ok.

282
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:25,130
In homeopathy unfortunately we do not have the absolute tool through

283
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:38,730
which we can say “this is the remedy, basta!” We don’t have such a possibility.

284
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,630
Always there is a possibility of a mistake.

285
00:35:42,730 --> 00:36:03,570
So what we are saying is the most probable remedy. Lyc. Yes? Med.

286
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:22,560
Who says lyc? Who agrees with him. Nobody agrees with him. Who agrees with med? Ok.

287
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:46,820
Who agrees with lach? Who agrees with phos? Who agrees with nat-m?

288
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:02,240
Very strange because she says she eats salt with food.

289
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:13,730
So, such a strong desire for salt should make you think of nat-m.

290
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:24,560
Yet I see very few of you support this idea. Most of you supported the idea of med.

291
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:43,150
Perche? Porquois? Why? Because she said that she enjoys very much the sun.

292
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:49,930
She is cold and when she goes to the sun, the sun is giving life.

293
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:59,130
This you will almost never hear from a person who really needs nat-m.

294
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:15,720
She needs a lot of salt. That means her organism does not absorb salt.

295
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:30,720
So whatever quantity is, she can take, it goes out. Otherwise with such salt…

296
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,820
No, you tell me, why I say this?

297
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:56,820
If the salt was absorbed, what would be different than what she said? The blood pressure.

298
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:08,710
You see her blood pressure is very low, unnaturally low.

299
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:14,670
And yet she takes a lot of salt and the blood pressure remains low.

300
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,880
That means almost nothing of salt is absorbed.

301
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:27,880
The organism needs salt, especially the nervous system to produce…

302
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,880
but she cannot absorb it.

303
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:43,550
That’s why when she goes to the sea with the salt which is all over the body,

304
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:54,980
she says “I feel rejuvenated”. So she is cold, she is better in the sun, better in the sea.

305
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:04,730
A passionate woman, has passions.

306
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:24,130
When I asked her “Just tell me the fruit” she told me “I don’t like fruit”.

307
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:34,550
But what she likes? She mentioned oranges. She does not like fruit but oranges are ok. Why?

308
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:48,900
Med is interested in oranges especially? Sour mostly.

309
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:56,800
But the chemistry of her body is not the typical chemistry.

310
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:06,560
There is a reason why we eat certain things, why I desire bread or salt or sweets etc.

311
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:17,640
It doesn’t matter we may not know the chemistry of the body to understand the real reason

312
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:24,740
and the complication of the biochemistry within the body.

313
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:34,970
But definitely in her case it’s obvious. She cannot absorb natrum chloratum.

314
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,560
She cannot absorb it.

315
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:49,960
And maybe she can absorb and be better if she is sunk in the sea through the pores.

316
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:54,170
So she needs something of that type.

317
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:05,410
But we know med is rejuvenated in the sea. We know med has desire for salt.

318
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:26,150
It’s one of the remedies which has desire for salt. I’ll show you the symptoms.

319
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,910
What remedy is coming?

320
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,060
Also, I forgot.

321
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:57,340
How do you explain the fact that con acted so well and did not touch the general condition?

322
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:17,070
Because of the suppression of her hormones.

323
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:42,400
But why con acted only locally? Con was correct or not correct? Correct.

324
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:52,380
But con acted without any aggravation. Immediate amelioration.

325
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:58,490
It acted as a remedy for an acute.

326
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:11,480
What she was having was a kind of a superficial thing happening upon her constitution.

327
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:23,390
We have said many times, we explained in the course how you have the basic constitution,

328
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:36,410
basic remedy, 1,2,3 layers but there is an acute and there is a layer on top which is formed.

329
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:47,220
In her case this was what happened due to the suppression

330
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:55,730
and not expression of her hormonal system the organism reacted.

331
00:44:55,830 --> 00:45:12,320
How? In a place where she is most sensitive. So that is a sensitive area for her.

332
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:23,540
If in somebody the sensitive area is the guts, the colon, he will have a diarrhea.

333
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:30,880
If the sensitive area is the respiratory he will have a sinusitis,

334
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:35,470
bronchitis or laryngitis or pneumonia.

335
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:47,300
If the sensitive area is the liver the expression will be through that sensitive area.

336
00:45:47,400 --> 00:46:00,290
So for her the sensitive area due to hereditary reason from her mother is this area.

337
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:02,570
The breast.

338
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:14,970
That’s why con acted as if you have a cold or an influenza or a diarrhea or a cystitis,

339
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:23,820
you take a remedy, the cystitis is gone but the basic organism is untouched.

340
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:32,570
So it needs a remedy in order to lift the first layer.

341
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:44,730
She took several remedies that did nothing actually. The first layer to be lifted is,

342
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:54,220
in her case, med. She has enough information in her case for med.

343
00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:20,900
Which is this information? You remember? Tumors in the ovaries, coldness of extremities.

344
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:41,550
It is very interesting in beef steak, in the repertory has been noted med

345
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:47,010
is one of the remedies for desire for beef.

346
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:10,720
Salt desire, obesity, desire for tobacco, approach of a storm is another point.

347
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:16,520
She is worse on the approach of a storm which is also covered.

348
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:34,630
Phos, also, yes. Phos was also a possibility.

349
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:44,320
You remember I made a remark to her about testosterone?

350
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:50,720
I said you must have very high testosterone.

351
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:57,530
How did I get it? From the way she spoke.

352
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:11,030
She was like that… No, lyc. Stram, yes but no lyc.

353
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:19,390
- I think that desire for beef should be out of the repertorization

354
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:23,380
because in Argentina is very common.

355
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:33,070
- Ok, we take it out. We take it out, see what happens.

356
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:42,070
The result will be the same. She does not agree.

357
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:52,570
Argentinians are eating mostly what? Sheep.

358
00:49:53,570 --> 00:50:05,070
- Is part of the regular diet in Argentina but not all the persons in Argentina eat meat.

359
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:19,540
- But she said it very strongly that “I have desire and it’s the only desire for meat.”

360
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:25,370
That you can use it actually because she said it so strongly.

361
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:29,470
It is different than “I like beef”.

362
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:39,370
“I desire beef and this is the only meat I like. All the other meat, I don’t”

363
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:50,560
then you maybe use it as a symptom. Ok tumors in ovaries.

364
00:50:53,310 --> 00:51:08,060
And a lot excrescences coming out with little tumors, let’s say tumors, in her body.

365
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:27,760
After you have this picture you can fit it with her character, with her makeup,

366
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:32,860
where she says “I am a passionate person.

367
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:47,360
When I love, I love with passion”. That is a characteristic of med, as you know.

368
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:53,760
So, we give med and we take away the passion.

369
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:22,380
She will become less reactive, more calm and the next remedy underneath

370
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,940
most probably will be calc.

371
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:36,840
It means after med the feeling of coldness will stay,

372
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:42,930
the desire for salt will be much less, the desire for sweets

373
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:47,680
which she does not have now will be increased.

374
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:56,710
The feet will remain cold, the fear of high places will remain,

375
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:59,070
I don’t know if it was there.

376
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:17,150
And also the sensitivity to changes of weather, especially to wet weather will remain.

377
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,880
But she will be on another level.

378
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:35,220
The potency will be 200CH one day and 1M the next day.

379
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:47,900
But get it from a good pharmacy, it is very important.

380
00:53:52,900 --> 00:54:04,650
For the guy who said that beef is not a symptom; we took it out.

381
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,150
Still med is coming first.

382
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:29,390
What is not typical for med in her case, is the fact that she feels the cold so much.

383
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:36,990
It’s not typical for med that she feels the cold so much as she describes.

384
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:44,630
But the coldness from the second remedy which is underneath,

385
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:54,230
which may be phos, calc-p, calc, may be one of these remedies.
