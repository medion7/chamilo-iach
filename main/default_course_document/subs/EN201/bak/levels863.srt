1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:15,210
This is the case of a 36 year old lady, married

2
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:24,960
and her main problem seems to be the fear of pregnancy.

3
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,550
- Fear of everything.

4
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:41,130
- She thinks being pregnant is a weird, frightening process.

5
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:53,120
She scares that this is one-way road. No turning back. And also her vision of babies is different.

6
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:58,960
When she looks at them she sees them like they are immature human.

7
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:06,210
- Yes, not cute for me. As immature, not to talk, not to walk. Needs to be grown up.

8
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:11,540
- Have you studied medicine?
- Yes I am a gynecologist also, obstetrician.

9
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,140
- Were you a good student?
- Yes very good.

10
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:31,470
- I can see it. She has serious fears while she is alone.

11
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:42,130
In your studies in order to memorize it was easy for you or difficult?

12
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:45,220
- Easy. Very easy.

13
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:04,630
- Fear of airplane all the time, fear of death, fear of losing her mind, fear of insanity,

14
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:14,620
fear of losing loved ones, fear of being closed… of being enclosed you mean in a narrow place?

15
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,910
- Yes.

16
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,220
- Like in the elevator, do you enter the elevator?
- Yes.

17
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,510
- When you are alone?
- Yes.

18
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:30,390
- You work in the hospital.
- Yes.

19
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,460
- Fear of tunnels. When you go through the tunnel you start having panic?

20
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,140
- Yes, when I’m alone.

21
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,040
- If somebody is next to you?
- No, nothing.

22
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,030
- You hold him?
- No, no fear.

23
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,330
- When there’s nobody her heartbeat goes extremely up.

24
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:11,150
- I stop the car at the beginning of the tunnel and I take the medicine if I don’t see the end.

25
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,800
- You fell you’re enclosed now, you’re going to die.

26
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:29,300
- Die or getting insane. And also with bridges. Same thing occurs with the bridge.

27
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,960
- When she drives on the bridge…

28
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,720
- … fear of earthquake, fear of dark, fear of elevator, fear of airplane,

29
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:49,140
her heart beat increases rapidly, she gets in panic states and cannot fly without medication. Xanax.

30
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:59,810
- With airplane, a company is not working, alone or with someone I fear the airplane.

31
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,650
- You feel panic.

32
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:10,900
- Panic, going insane, not to get out, what I am doing?

33
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,250
- Confusion.
- Very confused.

34
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:25,400
- Cries like a child and cannot control, she wants to get out of the plane.

35
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,750
- “Wait, wait, wait” I can say…

36
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,080
- And she takes Xanax.

37
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,230
- When did you meet each other?
- 2 years almost.

38
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:44,580
- And you married straight away.
- 6 or 7months later.

39
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,900
- But you had other girlfriends before.
- Yes.

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,080
- And also you had boyfriends?
- Yes.

41
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:07,160
- But when did it start? These panic attacks. What was the first experience?

42
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:22,340
- Panic attack started at the age of 17 when I was beginning studying for an exam.

43
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,320
- When did it start? 
- 17.

44
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,170
- In Turkey?
- Yes.

45
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:42,840
- In the age of 18 in Turkey we have the university exam. To enter the university.

46
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:48,410
One exam. If you pass you go to university if you don’t pass you have to wait one year.

47
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,760
It is generally high stress for everybody.

48
00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:08,160
- That time started. You have taken before a kind of medicine to take the examinations,

49
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:15,100
to make your mind clear…?
- No, no medicine before that.

50
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,410
- I hope you have discussed everything because I will put some difficult questions.

51
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,150
- Yes go ahead.

52
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,660
- Have you used marijuana before? 
- No.

53
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,670
No cigarette at all. I have not touched cigarettes at all.

54
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,840
- No marijuana, no drugs.

55
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,510
- Just alcohol. Social drinker. Once a month.

56
00:06:49,770 --> 00:07:04,840
- Alcohol affects her easily. If she drinks 2 glasses of wine, she relaxes very easily. Highly relaxed.

57
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:15,260
- You can ask everything… He knows everything.

58
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:38,760
-  I believe. Now what I want to know is… the life up to 18 you had any serious disease

59
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:52,380
or infectious disease or epidemic…? It’s written here. Medical background.

60
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,780
Surgery?
- After that.

61
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:12,280
- Appendix. When the appendix was operated?
- 32.

62
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,350
- When she was 32.

63
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:22,930
- No serious diseases, just smallpox, mumps.

64
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:28,350
- You had smallpox?
- Yes, in the childhood.

65
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:33,350
- As a child? No chickenpox?

66
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:49,200
- Chickenpox sorry! Mumps. Long period of bronchitis.

67
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:56,690
- What were you doing for bronchitis?
- Medicines.

68
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,440
- What kind of medicines you were doing for bronchitis?

69
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,290
- Syrup.

70
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:15,190
- The first bronchitis came with fever? You remember that fever? You never had fever?

71
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:25,440
- No I had. In my childhood. I remember the cold things here and here.

72
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,280
- What age?

73
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:39,610
- Before 17 but I don’t remember. Maybe 7 or 10… In elementary school.

74
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:55,280
- And after this bronchitis then you remained with a kind of a chronic bronchitis?

75
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:03,950
- Stopped in the childhood. No bronchitis. Nothing.

76
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:20,380
- And your menses came at what age?
- 12. It’s regular.

77
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:31,280
- And premenstrual syndrome?
- Very bad. Only psychologically.

78
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:38,440
- But you are irritated, you are depressed, you are anxious, you are angry? All of these.

79
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:50,190
- Yes. Character changes almost 70% with the period. I am a different one.

80
00:10:50,290 --> 00:11:01,430
- Different? A bad person?
- Anxious and depressed.

81
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:14,290
- Weeping, crying very easily. 
- Highly sensitive and can cry easily.

82
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,180
- But not dysmenorrhea, no pains at all.

83
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,780
- Menses last for how long?
- 5-6 days.

84
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,190
- With a lot of blood?
- Not a lot.

85
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:42,530
- Which is the day with the most blood?
- 2nd, 3rd.

86
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:49,030
- The blood is clear, bright blood?
- No. Dark.

87
00:11:49,130 --> 00:12:02,100
- Dark and with some clots?
- Yes. Not black but dark, brownish.

88
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:15,540
- And it is not stringy?
- No.

89
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:34,590
- Can I say something? Before the age of 17 my psychological period is difficult.

90
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:48,030
Not for the physiological one but the psychological because my parents were fighting.

91
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:55,440
Every night my…

92
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,940
- Let me explain this because this is a thing we have discussed.

93
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:15,440
During the age of 5 and 6 she witnessed her mother cheating on her father with another man.

94
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,690
At the age of 5.

95
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:38,040
- I saw and I didn’t tell anyone but she didn’t understand I saw her and also…

96
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:50,280
- She also was talking with a new man, and as a child at the age of 5 she did not understand

97
00:13:50,380 --> 00:14:03,030
therefore in front of her they were kissing and she didn’t take her as a person.

98
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,030
She thought she wouldn’t understand.

99
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:11,850
- Her mother thought she was too young.
- Exactly.

100
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:21,960
And this continued 20 years with different men. It started from the age of 5 until the age of 25.

101
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,860
Nobody told her not to say to her father anything but she decided herself

102
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:36,200
not to tell to her father anything and after a while at the age of 20s

103
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:54,940
her mother took one of her lovers and introduced to her like a friend, like a normal thing.

104
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:03,940
And this time at the age of 25 she said to her mother…

105
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,450
- Not to hear, not to see, not to get any news about this part.

106
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,730
Told my mum not to tell me anything anymore.

107
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:22,970
- But 20 years between 5 and 25 she lived with this kind of pressure.

108
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:28,530
Knowing everything, hiding from her father, hiding from everybody

109
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:38,790
but a part of time she was a friend of her mother like sisters but when the time changed,

110
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:43,280
when she grew up, at the age of 25, said “This is too much for me.

111
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,290
I don’t anything to hear about anything, just don’t tell me anything”

112
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:55,880
but she knew her mother was continuing because of her mobiles…

113
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:04,380
But 20 years there was high pressure. This is what we think.

114
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:12,390
Now if we look behind this is what we think, this is one of the serious psychological things.

115
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:26,320
- Let me understand. When this bad psychological state

116
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,920
which you had since childhood at what time became unbearable?

117
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:49,400
At what age? 17, 18, 20 after 20?
- After 20. 24 maybe. Stopped the relationship.

118
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:57,100
- Gradually you became worse and worse… Claustrophobic.

119
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:08,680
- After earthquake. 1999.

120
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:23,410
- 25. Because at the age of 25 it is the same year, maybe with one year difference,

121
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,260
there was an earthquake in Turkey.

122
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:38,510
She was at the age of 25 after the earthquake her fears about death and losing her mind increased.

123
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:50,020
- Losing my mind started with earthquake. Just this fear.

124
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,340
- Anxiety after fright.

125
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:07,740
- This is the only one fear of my fears, that starts with earthquake exactly.

126
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:23,760
I know the time. I see the people like creatures. I see world like this…

127
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:42,080
- You saw the world  becoming very small.
- And the sky comes on her.

128
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:51,830
- Cannot open my eyes because I see the things not that before…

129
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:59,730
I can’t understand what is this… did not recognize.

130
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:09,730
I took the medicine Xanax 4 times daily at that time.

131
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,710
- At the earthquake.

132
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:18,230
- I went to the psychiatrist and said I can take this.

133
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:24,480
- You have taken several remedies. How many?
- 4.

134
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:32,340
- Which remedies? You have not written here.
- First one is lach.

135
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:48,650
- Then?
- Stram. Arg-n. Hyosc. Med.

136
00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:09,880
- One dose. The jealousy is also very high. Number three it’s in the paper.

137
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,880
- With all your lovers you were jealous?
- Yes.

138
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,680
- You were imagining things or you were jealous with a reason?

139
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,930
- No.

140
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:26,680
- He looks another woman.
- No. Imagining.

141
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:34,680
My imagination runs a lot. I imagine a lot. I’m not speaking.

142
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,420
- You were thinking it was very easy to cheat on you.

143
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,030
- Yes.

144
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:57,530
- She can see or she can assume every chance I can cheat on her.

145
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:05,150
Yes, because again I think when a person at the age between 5 and 25 is growing up

146
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:12,410
in this kind of family environment is very sensitive cause

147
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:18,910
probably she experienced many different ways of cheating in her childhood,

148
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:28,270
therefore she is imagining, she is assuming everything that can happen.

149
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:35,620
For example if I go abroad for a work trip, job, business trip for 2 days..

150
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,620
- She has to call you 20 times...

151
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:45,330
- No! I’m just thinking and press myself not to tell.

152
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:52,360
- She tries not to call me but those 2 days she cannot sleep.

153
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:02,080
- Just thinking things. But not to tell him…

154
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:08,080
- What you are experiencing.
- Yes. After he comes, yes, I say.

155
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,510
- But now I know. After the journey I know what is coming after.

156
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:28,410
- Arrhythmia and tachycardia. You have arrhythmia.
- Yes, sometimes.

157
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,330
- Missing beats.

158
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:45,870
- Yes paroxysmal. I saw the cardiologist, perhaps it is atrial tachycardia.

159
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,950
- And the cardiologist is worried about your heart?
- No.

160
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:03,760
- He says…
- No. It’s psychological.

161
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:16,060
- They couldn’t find any physical or biological substances. But it goes really high.

162
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:32,760
- She became more quarrelsome, premenstrual… more jealous,

163
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:46,000
more fragile that her social life is affected, she has migraine attacks during this period.

164
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,500
The premenstrual period, you get headaches?
- Yes, headaches. Not all the time.

165
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,330
- Where?
- Here.

166
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,930
- On the left side.
- Yes.

167
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:24,500
- Fragile, very sensitive, weeps very easily for personal matters, can be childish,

168
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:32,200
has very high perception. You are intuitive? What do you mean perception?

169
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:37,840
- I can see everything, I can hear everything, I see, hear…

170
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:48,590
- Your hearing is very sensitive or your eyes, you can see well. Your five senses are increased.

171
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:54,690
- Yes. Also sixth sense increased.

172
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,340
- That means you perceive, you are intuitive.

173
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:21,840
- Yes. She is like a radar. She is very sensitive to the high volume voice,

174
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:30,940
even when you are talking normally can be destructive for her. High voice is destructive.

175
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:57,840
- Do you have a good appetite?
- So and so.

176
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,840
- Thirst?
- Yes, it’s normal.

177
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,350
- For cold water?
- Yes.

178
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,350
- Very cold?
- Yes I can drink it.

179
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:11,420
- She likes cold water. She can’t drink normal water.

180
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:22,350
Winter and summer from the refrigerator. Even in the winter. And she loves salt.

181
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,670
- That means you take the salt before you taste?

182
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,520
- Yes. Always.

183
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:58,210
- As for appetite, we are very similar. She cannot eat hot, spicy food, pepper… Zero tolerance.

184
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:05,040
- How about fish?
- Yes. Some sort of fish.

185
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:12,140
- What about oysters?
- Yes, she likes.

186
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:19,280
- What about meat?
- So and so. Normal.

187
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,970
- Sweets?
- From time to time she likes a lot.

188
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:38,380
- In premenstrual periods I have high appetite.
- And high desire for sweets.

189
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,280
- You like ice cream?
- Not much.

190
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,740
- You are not afraid of thunderstorms?
- No.

191
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,450
- She is afraid of almost everything but thunderstorms.

192
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:57,800
- I can see I can be with…

193
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:05,770
- And you are not afraid of ghosts or supernatural things?

194
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,520
- Maybe I am afraid but…

195
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:21,530
- Didn’t think about it before. She cannot eat sour food. Zero tolerance.

196
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:27,130
Vinegar she doesn’t like. No tolerance.

197
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:37,540
- What about at your sleep? You sleep right through the night?

198
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,280
Do you wake up during the night?
- No.

199
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,440
- You sleep right through. And in the morning you wake up refreshed?

200
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,700
- Sometimes.

201
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,370
- Most of the times?
- Good.

202
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,780
- Also if she needs to wake up in the middle of the night, like three o’clock the telephone calls

203
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,530
and she needs to go to birth, because she is a doctor, she wakes up fresh and very quick.

204
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:22,610
Not sleepy, just fresh. And she is not a type of a person that she sticks in the bed.

205
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:27,360
You know some people, they just like bed, but when she gets up, she gets up.

206
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:33,460
She is not like sleepy. She gets up really quickly.

207
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,540
- Fruits? You like?
- Yes.

208
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,790
- Which fruits? All kinds of fruits?
- Yes, can be.

209
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:51,270
- Oranges?
- Yes, we eat oranges.

210
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,860
- Bananas?
- Yes.

211
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:00,110
- Do you grind your teeth in sleep?
- I don’t know.

212
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,610
- You never heard?
- I never heard.

213
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,460
- You sleep very deeply.

214
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:11,830
- I sleep very deeply in certain hours... When I sleep, I sleep deep.

215
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,080
But when I wake up, I wake up.

216
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:22,700
- When the meat has some fat you will take it?

217
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:33,540
- Yes I can take it. Lamb chops I can.

218
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:42,360
- You are affected mostly by heat or by cold?

219
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:47,740
Do you feel the cold very much or you feel the heat very much if you are bothered…

220
00:30:49,840 --> 00:31:01,340
- Both actually, I don’t like very hot places and I don’t like the sun too much.

221
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:16,230
I don’t like cold places but when I’ m at home when it is cold I don’t like to wear…

222
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:27,320
- She turns the heater on. 
- The home should be like 24-26 degrees.

223
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:34,260
- What age did you put this mark?
- 24.

224
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:49,240
- What was the idea that your friend told you “do it”?

225
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,990
Or you decided?
- Yes.

226
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:55,990
- What is this?
- Butterfly.

227
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:07,750
- There are 2 tattoos there. The first one under this one is a dragon, under this.

228
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,490
And I don’t like it.

229
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:13,250
- And you covered it with the butterfly.

230
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:20,560
- This is the filema written free, it is my name Ozgul, in Turkish.

231
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:26,470
- And dragonfly is her Chinese horoscope sign.

232
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:36,070
- This is the dragonfly and this tattoo was like first and her name was written there, free.

233
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,260
And one year later she changed it with the butterfly.

234
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:58,660
- You never expected I will ask this question.
- We learn.

235
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,260
- Of course.

236
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:13,160
- In sleep do you have any salivation?

237
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:16,410
Saliva in the pillow?
- No.

238
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:22,410
- Any perspiration around that area?
- During sleep, no.

239
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:30,240
- Do you have any problem with the stool? Do you have a bowel motion every day

240
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,320
or you are constipated?

241
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:44,070
- Sometimes I’m constipated, when we travel sometimes and also I’m shy about doing this thing,

242
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:53,500
when he is at home, I cannot. If he goes away I can freely, yes.

243
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,760
- Very interesting.

244
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:11,080
- And also one thing we wrote down here… she likes to control everything.

245
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:19,670
- Everything, every one. Every event, every person should be controlled.

246
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,820
- Every person?

247
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:31,570
- Yes, she wants to. She wants to know everything, what’s happening, how happens.

248
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:34,080
- Yes I’ m curious.

249
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:47,580
- High level of curiosity. Especially I think this is related to jealousy in relationship.

250
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:56,330
She is not jealous for example about cars, about money, about material things.

251
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:02,580
For example she doesn’t want an airplane, a new car, but…

252
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,740
- But she wants to know where you are.

253
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:16,850
- All jealousy is on person nothing about material things or job or money.

254
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:31,790
- Are you self-confident? About your job?

255
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:44,650
- Until an age I was very self-confident about myself.

256
00:35:44,750 --> 00:36:04,070
Until the age of 25 I was like “Wow! What am I?” after that something went downwards.

257
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:09,930
Maybe the earthquake, maybe the relationship…

258
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:15,920
- Your first relationship with a man was at what age?

259
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,010
- 17.

260
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,740
- Full relationship?
- Yes.

261
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,850
- You enjoyed it or it was not a good experience?
- Yes, I enjoyed it.

262
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:35,510
- And you had a cystitis after that contact if you remember?

263
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,250
- No. I don’t remember that.

264
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:43,070
- But you have frequent cystitis.
- Yes.

265
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:51,100
- When did it start? The age of 20?
- No, maybe 30.

266
00:36:55,110 --> 00:37:07,600
- The cystitis is with pain or discomfort?
- Discomfort.

267
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Like, I can sit all the day. If no job I can sit there and warm things here and wait.

268
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:49,830
- And this can come by itself, the crisis of cystitis?

269
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:55,500
- It starts near menstruation, approaching menstruation.

270
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,920
- Cold bathing affects?
- No.

271
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:09,830
But maybe my feet are always cold; summer, winter, always.

272
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:18,580
- But cystitis comes…
- Often with stressful conditions.

273
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:26,680
It will come. I think of something bad, psychologically in deep and it will come.

274
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,260
- Stress increases.

275
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:43,170
- Can I add something? I got pregnant. In the past.

276
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:55,000
- But now you take precautions.
- Yes, protection.

277
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:03,080
- You have never had free sex by chance…?

278
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:19,420
- No I have intrauterine device. When I was pregnant I was very nauseous

279
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:33,410
that I didn’t see a patient in my job period time. I thought I could jump from the window.

280
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:40,320
It was very bad nausea, no medicine could control me.

281
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:51,650
- The thing is she cannot control anything she cannot return back makes her anxious,

282
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,490
makes her nervous. For example she cannot get in the boat

283
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,990
because she thinks this is not under control.

284
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:03,780
Because the boats in the sea she cannot come back if she want it.

285
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,570
She cannot get on the plane because she is afraid she has no control.

286
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:12,080
If she changes her mind she cannot get out of the plane, she cannot get out of the boat.

287
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:17,320
Pregnancy more or less the same is like one-way ticket.

288
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:22,900
If she changes her mind after 4 months, she cannot get rid of it.

289
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:31,260
Anything that is not controlled by her makes her terribly nervous.

290
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:36,510
One or two things we may like to add if you are ok.

291
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:58,710
- Nail biting. Also perspiration in the genitalia, after bath it perspires a lot.

292
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:28,310
- Perspiration is offensive?
- Not smelly… high sexuality.

293
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,970
- How high?
- High. As much as we can.

294
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:45,470
- Every day?
- Yes, couple of times a day.

295
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:49,710
- Do you have an orgasm? 
- Yes.

296
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:56,560
- You know what is an orgasm?
- Yes, she is a doctor.

297
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,450
- Many times women do not know what an orgasm is.

298
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:07,040
They don’t have final satisfaction and they need constant stimulation.

299
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:16,730
- I did masturbate when I was at the age of 4-5.

300
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:25,370
- She did her first masturbation at the age of 5.

301
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:31,720
- I remember doing it very frequently.

302
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:40,910
- With your hands? Or you were pushing…?

303
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:49,270
- With my hands after 18 but before like crossing the legs.

304
00:42:53,260 --> 00:43:02,630
- One more thing. After our experience we have some notes.

305
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:10,870
For example if she walks down the steps she cannot walk with 2 legs.

306
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:17,560
She always needs to put the left leg on the front and slowly.

307
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:19,460
- Like you will fall.

308
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:37,460
- Yes, but with speed, I put my left leg 2-3 steps down, always left.

309
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:45,490
- Normally I go left- right-left. She does it left- left- left.

310
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:56,250
- You will have to get through my secretary, you will have to get my e-mail,

311
00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:04,970
so you’ ll have to write a report, stop coffee, stop all medication

312
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:11,460
and then you write a report in 2 months.

313
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,040
- After finishing the remedy.

314
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:19,800
- Yes and for her also. So I can know how to continue.

315
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,240
- Perfect.

316
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:26,350
- What’s the remedy?
- What’s your remedy? I don’t know.

317
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:34,900
- If I tell you now the class…

318
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:57,480
Now this is an easy case, so therefore I will let you study it

319
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:15,320
and in the afternoon you will give me your decision in a little piece of paper.

320
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:26,760
And I will do the analysis and see, who is a good student..

321
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:38,330
No with a name, we don’t disclose names here. We are learning.

322
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,980
I learned a lot today with this case and yesterday,

323
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:53,330
every day if you do this kind of homeopathy you will learn.

324
00:45:55,090 --> 00:46:04,830
Because this is a big issue with this case, not so easy. We will see.

325
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:14,980
Did you like the case?
- Yes.

326
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,320
- Was it interesting?
- Yes.

327
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:46,910
- Why it was interesting? When the patient is open and communicates

328
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:55,400
then there is a reciprocal energy that’s going back and out.

329
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:00,400
That does not make you exhausted.

330
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:06,810
But if the person is closed and does not allow expression

331
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:24,090
and you battle to get the information to help that person… it is very difficult, very tiring.

332
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:33,820
With these two very nice people, on a certain level

333
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:49,340
that means they are quite healthy though with all these fears…

334
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,990
This case seems easy but it is difficult.

335
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:52,650
Who wrote plat.? Who wrote ambra grisea? Who wrote acon? Who wrote phos? Who wrote staph?

336
00:48:52,750 --> 00:49:13,250
Who wrote nat-m? Who wrote hyos? In between. I see the problem.

337
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:23,990
I thought 80% would write the same remedy but I was wrong. It was equal.

338
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:26,910
Different people wrote different things.

339
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:46,910
I will have a problem because this case appears to be quite clear. It is a clear case.

340
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:18,090
Here you have a baby who is sexually very active,

341
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:25,580
so with this idea I understand some of you prescribed plat.

342
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:37,840
Now let’s see whether the plat continued to be right through the case or what has happened.

343
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:55,230
Between 6-21 year there are some changes and she becomes more and more anxious,

344
00:50:55,330 --> 00:51:04,340
more and more phobic, claustrophobic especially.

345
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:26,740
There is a symptom which I thought you would have taken notice

346
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:33,490
of much more than you did and that symptom it was if you understood,

347
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:44,840
that she could not have a stool unless she is alone in the house. Even her husband is going away.

348
00:51:44,940 --> 00:52:05,000
That is a symptom of ambr-g, so definitely there is plat, there is the possibility of ambr-g,

349
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:21,000
shall we give plat or ambr-g? Or phos? She had some symptoms of phos, not complete phos.

350
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:30,650
because her main problem at the moment is the fears.

351
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:37,250
Fear of death, fear of being closed in a place, panic attacks.

352
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:49,400
But she says when I ask her “When these panic attacks started really?”

353
00:52:49,500 --> 00:53:05,740
she said “It was the day I was in the earthquake”. So during this time we must consider

354
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:19,320
that something new overwhelmed the organism and created a new state of mind.

355
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:26,830
She says: “I was almost crazy, I didn’t know where I was.”

356
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:32,840
A big change in her mental state due to this fright.

357
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:43,940
So ailments from fright should be considered as a symptom you have to take into consideration.

358
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:51,940
So ailments from fright, do you have some symptoms?

359
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:25,400
Ailments from fright; we have several remedies on very high level.

360
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:40,490
Forth level, which is; acon, op and stram. So the fear is in such intensity you cannot ignore it.

361
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:47,830
Not only the fear is strong but it has created a new state of health.

362
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:56,520
Therefore you have to consider it as something acute that happened

363
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,840
and established a new state of health.

364
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:09,930
You should not go away from these remedies here.

365
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:27,660
The next thing you ask is which of these remedies have fear of narrow places?

366
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:35,260
Going into panic in narrow places? There are two out of them.

367
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:53,260
Mostly two, acon and stram, not op. Op is gone.

368
00:55:55,020 --> 00:56:04,510
So your choice should have been between these two remedies.

369
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:18,910
Now, what is another element which is very strong in her mental state? Which is the symptom.

370
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:38,270
Fear of death. Acon is in the 3rd degree, stram is in the 1st.

371
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:46,910
Stram does not have actually real fear of death.

372
00:56:47,010 --> 00:57:00,170
The remedies that have very strong fear of death are ars, plat, acon should be on the 4th degree

373
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:05,010
together with ars and plat. Make a note.

374
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:16,420
So between stram and acon fear of narrow places, panic attacks,

375
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:26,680
you know that acon has tremendous panic attacks that cannot be controlled.

376
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:34,170
They get into panic attacks that there is no control, even if somebody is next to them

377
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:44,350
the moment that the panic starts, it doesn’t matter. She just wants to fly away from the situation.

378
00:57:46,540 --> 00:58:02,520
It’s a remedy that creates tremendous panic attacks. Show me the explanation for acon…

379
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:29,270
Acon is the first of course. It has fear of airplane, very strong. You see that in the 4th degree.

380
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:42,170
Ailments from fright, fear on tunnels, before menses aggravates, fear of the dark,

381
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:53,910
fear of death, biting nails, desire for water, palpitations, weeping mood,

382
00:58:54,010 --> 00:59:00,260
fear of insanity, hearing acute.

383
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:08,860
Clairvoyance, irregular pulse, headache during menses.

384
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:14,830
Acon therefore covers most of her syptoms.

385
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:22,170
So we were lead to acon because of the beginning stage

386
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:35,020
but then we found out acon is supported very well by her symptomatology.

387
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:48,410
I will tell you another secret today, concerning hi and low potencies.

388
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:16,630
She is in group… In what group would you place her? Group 1, 2 frequent acutes? No. Group 3.

389
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:23,380
So she is in group 3 because we consider this a mental case

390
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:35,650
where the immune system has been severely suppressed and oppressed, cannot have an acute.

391
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:53,150
When she had an acute she was much back in her life. So therefore this is group C.

392
01:00:55,160 --> 01:01:19,740
In this group I really mean I will give acon 50M. She is amazed. You don’t understand, yes.

393
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:30,890
I give 50M , I like your reaction, you have to react,

394
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:46,070
“he tells us this now he tells us that, what’s going on…” What we said this is an uppermost layer

395
01:01:46,830 --> 01:02:00,480
which I consider as an acute. I’m not prescribing there for plat which is much deeper.

396
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:09,920
If will go to her childhood we may find plat. Those of you who prescribed plat…

397
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:17,680
Plat, if it is given now it will change the case, simply. Will not help.

398
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:23,560
Will change the symptoms will appear, this is less… that is more…

399
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:30,400
this is changed but not real change.

400
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:37,640
So you have to unravel the case by giving the first remedy

401
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:45,640
which is the remedy for panic attacks which fits very well.

402
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:52,500
But that remedy is not going to touch the underlying pathology.

403
01:02:54,490 --> 01:03:05,730
The underlying pathology is quite deep. Why this deep pathology has happened?

404
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:19,330
First, because the hormonal system of the child is overbalanced.

405
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:35,900
The estrogens etc. are in tremendous excess, she could not control it she had to masturbate,

406
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:46,230
she had to release the excessive sexual energy that was coming from the imbalance.

407
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:56,260
If you go now at this stage and try to touch that point, it’s too deep

408
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:08,330
and the acon will not allow you to do anything. First get rid of my fear,

409
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:14,070
of that tremendous shock which I had.

410
01:04:15,830 --> 01:04:25,760
And if you get out the shock then we may be able to see underneath.

411
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:40,330
What are we going to see underneath? Nat-m. Maybe nat-m maybe something else. What else?

412
01:04:41,580 --> 01:05:03,580
What do we expect to see underneath? Staph. I’m not sure.

413
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:13,480
There is a remedy most probably that will come. I’m not sure.

414
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:27,660
But most probably the remedy that comes second to help her will be ambr-g.

415
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:39,170
Show me now in the line of the repertorization. I will explain to you a little.

416
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:48,820
Ambr-g is the second remedy. Now how many symptoms she has?

417
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:56,920
Ambr-g has aversion to presence (of strangers) cannot have a stool, desire for salt,

418
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:06,610
palpitation in the heart, fear of insanity, perspiration in inguinal region.

419
01:06:06,710 --> 01:06:17,000
You see therefore you have a remedy which contains two keynotes of this case.

420
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:22,760
One is that she cannot have a stool in the presence of anybody,

421
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:33,100
the second is perspiration in the inguinal region. Very interesting.

422
01:06:40,840 --> 01:07:00,830
You see fear to have a stool which is connected with some kind of sexual activity is withheld,

423
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:09,430
cannot be seen, does not want to be seen with ambr-g.

424
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:22,470
We are theorizing now but anyhow I can tell you how a child,

425
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:36,960
who is so much aware of her sexuality withholds later on in life an act

426
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:51,830
which is connected somewhat with the sexual function. How is it connected?

427
01:07:55,070 --> 01:08:13,060
Do you understand my English? You did not hear it quite well. I can see it in your eyes, ok.

428
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:16,810
Be careful what you think…

429
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:32,460
Well, I said that the fact that she cannot have a stool in front of anybody, even her husband,

430
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:45,210
it is a sign most probably that she is withholding an action

431
01:08:45,310 --> 01:09:02,210
which is similar or near to kind of sexual act because she was aware of her sexuality

432
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:09,810
and she was also aware of what happens because of the sexuality.

433
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:16,650
So the combination, you remember you don’t follow now.

434
01:09:17,390 --> 01:09:40,540
The combination of not being able to let loose because I do something

435
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:53,400
and I connect it in my little mind with what I saw in my mother.

436
01:09:56,140 --> 01:10:02,380
She understood everything, what was going on, she was watching, she knew everything,

437
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:10,370
she is doing sex, I know sex etc. and you are doing something with another man

438
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:13,130
and she knows everything.

439
01:10:13,230 --> 01:10:21,380
And that combination between the intensity of her sexuality and at the same time seeing,

440
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:30,380
realizing what sexuality can lead a person to do, she knew, my mother is doing something wrong.

441
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:37,890
That most probably brought about a new state of health.

442
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:52,380
So if we had this child as a patient at the age of 7-8 we would say, sexuality is excessive, plat.

443
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:57,980
And most probably it would be balanced.

444
01:10:58,230 --> 01:11:02,910
But now the child was left without treatment

445
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:14,460
and the fact that she knows all this secret about the sexual things which are happening,

446
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:27,060
most probably she is withholding. It’s “no, I don’t want to be seen”.

447
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:51,810
Most probably the second remedy will be ambr-g. and possibly the third remedy will be plat.

448
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:14,520
- …

449
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:23,880
- Yes it is very interesting that ambr-g has such strong symptom.

450
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:39,060
This symptom for ambr-g is a strong keynote. Then hyos, you will see hyos, show me hyos.

451
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:55,510
Hyos is the third remedy you will see… how many symptoms? 12.

452
01:12:55,610 --> 01:13:12,900
Ambr-g has only 6 covering but has 2 keynotes of the case. And the system says “be careful”.

453
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:34,230
Hyos has 12. Now see phos. 15 symptoms. Yet you give phos. Nothing.

454
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:49,390
- So how does this system tell you to “be careful with ambr-g”?

455
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:59,390
- Because it contains two keynotes of the case. If you look at ambr-g it contains 2 keynotes.

456
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:08,850
One; cannot have a stool, the other is the peculiar perspiration in the inguinal region.

457
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:12,000
No other remedy has that.

458
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,470
- But how does.. you said the system tells you to…

459
01:14:15,570 --> 01:14:25,220
- Just because it shows you that in spite of the fact that it has only 6 symptoms out of 20,

460
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:31,980
still you have to be careful about that. Because it comes quite high.

461
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:40,220
It could have been first even. So if you see, then you have to decide of course

462
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:51,150
and then you go to the M.M. you see, it fits or it doesn’t fit and you give it or you don’t give it.

463
01:14:54,400 --> 01:15:04,400
Bringing up in your attention remedies who are not having all the symptoms.

464
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:18,050
- During the earthquake she told us that she had a delusion that things are going smaller and smaller.

465
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:22,050
- And came over her.

466
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:27,800
- And this is a symptom of plat. How can you explain it?

467
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:35,340
- No, no it is not a symptom of plat. It is different.

468
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:44,590
What she says is the whole world became small and came upon her and overwhelmed her,

469
01:15:44,690 --> 01:16:00,500
so it’s not a matter of looking something as smaller than what really is. But plat is underneath.

470
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:07,740
- What about the fear of pregnancy?

471
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:20,880
- Something also that I have to explain and to say is that after acon

472
01:16:20,980 --> 01:16:31,150
the symptoms of acon will be reduced very much and some other fears may remain.

473
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:37,630
Fear of death maybe remain, but not as panic attacks.

474
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:45,910
She may still have fear of death; she may still have fear of bearing a child.

475
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:58,150
- I have a question about the levels of health

476
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:03,900
because the frequent cystitis she has every 2 months, I thought it was group C.

477
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:16,570
- That’s a good question, yes. So what do you say? I’m in a difficult state now.

478
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:36,910
When I say acute, I mean something, an infection that has high fever.

479
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:47,560
In those levels, group 3, there is hectic fever or no fever at all, some infection is there

480
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:55,410
but the organism does not have the strength to get rid of it.

481
01:17:55,900 --> 01:18:07,660
After acon she may develop frequent cystitis with fever and then we have to treat.
