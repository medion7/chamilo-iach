1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:16,270
He was born a normal child and he developed autism after when he was a year and a half.

2
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:23,010
He was immunized and shortly after that he became severely autistic.

3
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,760
However, even before that there were certain…

4
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,860
- What were the vaccinations?
- MMR.

5
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:40,260
- That’s all. Previously he had other vaccinations?

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:47,500
- A few. Not all. Because we were postponing everything. I don’t like vaccinations.

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,550
- Why you were postponing, you were afraid?

8
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:57,640
- Well I don’t like vaccinations at all but I couldn’t find a way to get rid of it

9
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:05,970
because I knew in Canada it’s not a law but I couldn’t find a way to evade this.

10
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,140
Everybody was telling there is a paper but I couldn’t find how to get the paper.

11
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:22,490
So… when he was at the age of 3. He didn’t have after that any… so I was postponing…

12
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,630
- So that means he had some at the age of 6 months?

13
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,130
- Yes some.

14
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,890
- Can you give me an idea? What exactly happened with the vaccinations?

15
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,550
- He only had one reaction…

16
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:44,900
- When it was the first vaccination and what was the vaccination?

17
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,970
- I think he was 2 months old but I don’t know what, I have it at home.

18
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:59,720
- Usually in Canada 2 and a half they do a diphtheria vaccination.

19
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,220
- For tetanus?

20
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:12,960
- Tetanus and diphtheria. That’s what they do 2 and a half.

21
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,710
- That was 2 months. Then again?

22
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:23,470
- I don’t remember. I have a paper but I don’t have it with me.

23
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:27,640
- But he didn’t react to them really.

24
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,880
- There was a preparation on the organism by these vaccinations.

25
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:39,660
And the 3rd time came the vaccination and the organism broke down.

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,110
It does not break down like that. The last vaccination what was it?

27
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,970
- MMR.

28
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,640
- And it was an anamnesis? It was given before this and repeated?

29
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,990
- No. It was the first time that he got it.

30
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,150
- And it was one and a half year old.
- Yes.

31
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,910
At that time also I stopped breast feeding him so, his was breast fed until 18 months.

32
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:24,140
He got rubella and 2 months after that he got his first big fever treated with antibiotics.

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,890
- You gave him antibiotics.
- She. She is the doctor.

34
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,250
- Is she a doctor?
- No, the doctor gave it.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,640
And then we went to Serbia because we are originally from Serbia

36
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:47,730
and my husband’s mother died and then we went back to Canada.

37
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:54,920
The kid got again throat infection, again treated with double antibiotics.

38
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:03,550
After that I noticed something, he was lost.

39
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:14,300
- So there was a vaccination. Then after the vaccination there were several times tonsillitis.

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,880
2 times or 3 times?
- 3 times.

41
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:23,120
First before Serbia and then after Serbia. In between 6 months.

42
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:31,610
- Three times tonsillitis and the last time you said he needed double vaccination?

43
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,600
- Double antibiotics.

44
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,460
- Because the fever would not go down?
- Yes.

45
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:52,450
- Also the trauma, she mentioned to me that when she stopped breast feeding he became very sad.

46
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,440
- She?
- No, the child.

47
00:04:55,540 --> 00:05:01,190
- He never reacted to it and it surprised me because I went to a friend 2 days,

48
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,430
I came back and he never – he loved breast feeding- and he never reacted.

49
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,720
And I felt terrible because we were sort of talking to each other,

50
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,940
I was asking him “Are you ready to cut off”.

51
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:24,250
So we cut it off and then he just didn’t react to it.

52
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,500
And I found that very strange, I felt I had betrayed my child

53
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,930
because he didn’t react to something that he really liked, he never asked about it.

54
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,290
So he suppressed his reaction.

55
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:54,150
- When you cut the breast feeding there was the vaccination.

56
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,840
And after 3 days you stopped? Or after 3 months you stopped breast feeding?

57
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,590
- Before. He was 1 year old when she stopped breast feeding him…

58
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,680
- No, a year and a half.

59
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,010
- He was a year and a half when you stopped breast feeding him.

60
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,980
- Exactly.

61
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,930
- Then he was vaccinated. How long after the cut off?

62
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,530
- Maybe a few days, a week or two weeks the most.

63
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,930
- And then the tonsillitis, when it came?

64
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:36,170
- So this was July 15th, tonsillitis in the beginning of November, that’s 4 months.

65
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:43,090
- 4 months later he developed severe tonsillitis.

66
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,590
Very high fever?
- Yes.

67
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:50,850
- Very high, 40C-41,5C.
- Ok.

68
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:56,850
Given antibiotics for how long, one week?
- Yes.

69
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,340
- Then you went to Serbia.

70
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,830
- Yes, it was emotional a very big thing, he really liked the grandma,

71
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,080
he was playing with her on her bed. She died from cancer

72
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,840
so the day that she went to the hospital he was crying. He knew she was going to die.

73
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,590
He was crying when she left.

74
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,850
- By the time that you went to Serbia he was already 2 years old.

75
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:24,260
- Not really, it was December when we went…

76
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,840
- 22 months.
- Yes.

77
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,510
- Has he started talking already?

78
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:42,020
- No he was late. Late talking. After that he started diminishing.

79
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,010
He started talking before that…

80
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,090
- You told me at 9 months he talked.
- Yes.

81
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:59,350
- Ok, when he was one and a half year old, when you cut breast feeding,

82
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:04,350
you were communicating by words with him?
- Yes.

83
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,090
- He was saying “yes”, “no”?
- Yes.

84
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,680
- He could understand what you were asking?
- Yes.

85
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:18,430
I would say to him “Bring the bottle” and he would go to other room and bring the bottle.

86
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,930
At the age of 4 my son couldn’t do that anymore. He had words.

87
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,280
We were reading a book, the cow says “moo” and he knew all that.

88
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,930
- You must tell that to the medical authorities.
- I know.

89
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,920
- They don’t want to listen. There were a few problems before with him

90
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:51,670
because he started teething very early. At 4 months he got his first teeth.

91
00:08:51,770 --> 00:09:03,420
And then his teeth at the age of 2 crumbled. In that period they were also getting bad.

92
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:10,730
- And the teeth fell off at the age of 2?
- No, crumbled. Like lots of cavities.

93
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,270
Especially the fore front that he got at 4 months.

94
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:25,560
So when he was one year old all his teeth were out. He had all teeth at one year.

95
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,920
- Ok, then?

96
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:40,900
- When I first saw him in the beginning of 2008 he was not communicating with anybody.

97
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,360
He was just running around in circles, making noise

98
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:54,550
and she said “I cannot communicate with my son. I cannot get through.” And she was crying.

99
00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:03,640
- He was by that time 4 years old.
- No, 3 years old.

100
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,150
- And you started giving…?

101
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,360
- No, first I didn’t know what to do, just running around.

102
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:22,710
I repertotized her, I gave her staph and she is just one remedy per se.

103
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:27,200
- You gave to the mother?
- Yes.

104
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,860
I do that with babies too, I give them the mother remedy first.

105
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,370
He also had staph symptoms with the teeth. They were all covered with yellow stuff.

106
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:46,720
- She was not breast feeding.
- I know. May be the right thing to do.

107
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,680
He reacted to staph, he started sleeping through the night, so after

108
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:58,180
that I thought about some more. I gave him carc.

109
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:04,190
So he was doing very well on carc and half a year later I gave him tub.

110
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:12,140
He had lot of allergies, severe. And he is grinding his teeth,

111
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,110
he is very restless at night and sweaty…

112
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,110
- But he has no teeth, how he was grinding his teeth?

113
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:23,450
- No, they were there, just crumbled.

114
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:30,290
- No, when she said all his teeth were out she meant at one he had all his teeth.

115
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,900
- Coming out not fall off.

116
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:39,050
- They were there just crumbled. He still grinds his teeth sometimes.

117
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,730
- I would like to say about allergies. I think he was a month and a half old.

118
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:52,140
From my husband’s side his younger brother had eczema when he was a little.

119
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:59,870
Extreme eczema as a result of food allergies but they never tested him.

120
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:05,610
So he developed first a serious eczema at a month and half,

121
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:09,200
my mother in law gave him a little bit of chocolate…

122
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,710
- At the age of 1 and a half he developed eczema?

123
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,570
- Month and a half.

124
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,380
- All over the body?
- Yes.

125
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,120
- And what you gave?

126
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:34,860
- Of course they prescribed cortisone and well I knew that cortisone is of course bad

127
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:40,630
so we did put some times, not all the time and then I was testing him through me

128
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,130
because he was breast feeding.

129
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:49,120
I would test him through me for the allergies meaning I would exclude milk for a week

130
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:57,620
and then watch my child. So by he was 5 and a half months

131
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,460
I had a list by testing him and he didn’t need any more... like nothing.

132
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,920
He didn’t need remedies. So that’s what we did.

133
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,950
- But how do you know that it was not suppressed by the cream already?

134
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:17,460
- Because it was never coming out. Because if I eat something it goes out. It was like really bad.

135
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,470
- Again?
- Yes, again and again it comes out.

136
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,460
- Yes, but after the final going away of the eczema,

137
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:33,460
did it come out a month later if he ate something allergic?

138
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,710
- I didn’t eat anything.

139
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:41,200
- But sometimes you may have accidentally eaten something.

140
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:49,070
- Definitely that it comes out. For example he was also allergic not only in food but perfumes.

141
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:54,120
If a lady comes with a perfume and touches him he gets eczema.

142
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:03,200
If the detergent is really strong and he scrubs on the detergent he gets eczema.

143
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:10,210
But that’s not very bad because you can wash it and it goes away.

144
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:18,070
The problem is when he gets the food inside and to the inhaling of the perfumes.

145
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,130
- And eczema came many times through when I started treating him.

146
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:30,130
His eczema was so bad as if he had 3rd degree burns.

147
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:33,040
- During your treatment the eczema came back?

148
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:41,820
- Yes. He had fevers like when I first gave him carc and tub and he had not very often,

149
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,300
every 3 months or so, extreme fevers. Like 40C and more.

150
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,140
- With tonsillitis.
- No. Mostly cough.

151
00:14:54,570 --> 00:15:06,560
Tonsillitis never came back. But between the fever or after the fever he often got eczema too.

152
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:15,290
And fevers were very long lasting and often after the fever he would also get better mentally.

153
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:24,060
He also developed infection in his mouth a few times. I gave him merc, bell,

154
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,520
puls he reacted very well and his fevers… He stopped drinking,

155
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,970
he became extremely clingy to his mother.

156
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,970
- He was very attached to me.

157
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:49,120
- His father is a severe man, is very detached?

158
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,870
- He is a lyc but he is a very nice guy. He is very nice

159
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,470
- You like him?
- Yes, very good parents.

160
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,750
- No, he is not detached.

161
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,240
He likes his son but he just didn’t know at the beginning,

162
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:14,930
before lyc how to play much with his son. Now it’s different.

163
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:32,830
- He always had this this cough as he would get in the acute, there is a lot of mucus.

164
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:40,590
But last year, exactly before the day I came here he started having severe dyspnea.

165
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,330
First time, last year, a year ago.

166
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:49,830
And ended up in the hospital, so eventually and this is what is…

167
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,080
- They gave him inhalations?

168
00:16:52,180 --> 00:17:00,770
- Yes. Right here, you see, mentally he is so much better every time after most of the remedies.

169
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,740
He would get so much better.

170
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,730
- That’s the only one that we have given him some times.

171
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,560
- He had one dose at that time of the cortisone…

172
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,230
- It contained cortisone?
- No, that one doesn’t.

173
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,070
The only one that doesn’t contain.

174
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:25,310
By that time he ended up in the hospital last year they gave him one dose of cortisone

175
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:32,340
to swallow, not to inhale. And plus cortisone liquid and it changed his behavior

176
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,310
but Helen gave him a remedy.

177
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:40,060
- After the cortisone did you notice any change in his behavior?

178
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:47,560
- He was like hyper! You couldn’t stop him. Not any more though.

179
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,560
- The most important thing I see here.

180
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:57,060
As he gets better and better mentally, his asthma gets worse.

181
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:06,480
Antimonium worked for almost a year, last year.

182
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:12,940
Though there is a little bit of rattling still there left. Then it stopped working.

183
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:20,200
Then the picture started changing more often like in May he was an ars,

184
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,690
because he developed very burning discharge

185
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:28,190
and some other symptoms for 3 weeks ars worked perfectly then it stopped.

186
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,930
Before that phos worked probably for almost a year.

187
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:41,940
Phos had a tremendous impact on him, mentally and emotionally.

188
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:52,780
But since last year asthma episodes started getting worse.

189
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,440
So now they have to use inhalers every time there is an episode of asthma

190
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:07,690
because he cannot breathe and so I started using these remedies more often.

191
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:13,190
Right now he is on antimonium which worked about 3 weeks ago,

192
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,930
so now he is on antimonium 200CH and 1M once a day.

193
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:23,690
- Is he coughing?
- No, but you can hear him wheezing.

194
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,210
- Sometimes. 
- Now he is really good.

195
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:36,430
But what we noticed when he started getting remedies often, like every day, a certain amount,

196
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:46,020
he got better. He is better mentally. But the remedies are shifting from 2 weeks to…

197
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,300
- Antimonium did stop working last year, totally.

198
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:58,140
And now it works again. And also tried puls last time. It did not work at all.

199
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:06,190
And he doesn’t have high fevers any more. He does not have these high fever episodes anymore.

200
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:13,790
Last month he had 37,5C.
- 38,5C.

201
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:23,180
- Mentally we’ll see him…
- He still has this…

202
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,170
- Can he respond easily to the questions?

203
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:34,420
- He may not appear especially when he is anxious but he understands everything,

204
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,920
he knows everything.

205
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:43,160
When we were in Athens last week they went one way from the hotel to wherever they go

206
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:47,000
then they wanted to take another route.

207
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,250
He had never been there before and said “No we go the exact same route”.

208
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:57,250
He knows everything and he is extremely sensitive to… not even criticism.

209
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:02,820
He is very afraid his mom is very angry at him.

210
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:08,090
So if she just raises her voice just like that he is so scared

211
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,780
“Why are you angry at me? What’s going on?” he wants to please her all the time.

212
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,530
- He says it or he looks like…

213
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,040
- No, he says “What’s wrong mom? You’re ok?”

214
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,280
- He needs approval.

215
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,520
At school when they say “Well, work and we will tell mom you had a good day at school”.

216
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,190
That is a motivator, the approval of mother.

217
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:35,800
- All the time.
- All the time. Of both parents.

218
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:42,050
- Overboard, you mean really all the time makes you tired

219
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,350
and y “Oh, you’re so good, you have done so well”…

220
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:49,370
- Yes, you have to tell him all the time that.

221
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:57,360
- If his father is strict with him he doesn’t get scared or upset but if his mom is…

222
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,960
- With mom it is worse.

223
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:14,090
- The approval he needs from you only or from his teachers…?

224
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,850
- From everybody but mom is the highest.

225
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:24,090
- However sometimes he gets into the periods when he is very upset at her.

226
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:29,920
She leaves for work without telling him then she comes back. He goes into his room,

227
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,090
closes the door and doesn’t want to talk to her. And she has to beg him for forgiveness.

228
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:41,600
- I have to tell him “I’m home, I’m sorry. Let it go.” Apologize.

229
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:49,670
- And another thing he does to punish them both if they don’t let him swim for the entire day,

230
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:57,860
he is not happy with his parents he soils his pants.

231
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,860
- As a punishment to us.

232
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:07,010
Yesterday we didn’t go swimming because it was so cold and he loves beach and water

233
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:12,360
and he would punish us by soiling his pants. Makes his statement.

234
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:18,010
- So he holds a grudge against somebody.

235
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:24,760
If you are not nice to him. There was a cousin that wasn’t nice to him.

236
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:32,300
9 months he wouldn’t see her. If she is in the room he behaves as if she doesn’t exist.

237
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:45,090
It’s not as extreme anymore but he holds a grudge a lot if somebody is pushing him away

238
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:48,940
or pushes him down, offends him.

239
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:53,440
- And a few times he had very close friends.

240
00:23:53,540 --> 00:24:00,130
They left and he suffered so much, I gave him ign a couple of times.

241
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:05,750
He became very sad and depressed.

242
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:11,160
- But it’s understandable because he doesn’t have many friends.

243
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:16,670
People don’t connect easily to him and when he has people who have patience,

244
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:22,400
because he is very smart and he can give a lot but he just cannot communicate as much,

245
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:31,760
then of course he gets upset if people go away or they don’t pay attention to him.

246
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:38,150
- He gets stuck on one food often and he eats one thing for a long time.

247
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,900
- He wants to eat only one food?

248
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,410
- No. He wants to eat spicy salsa or spaghetti.

249
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,660
- Everyday spaghetti?

250
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,410
- Not every day but he is like narrow-minded with food.

251
00:24:53,510 --> 00:25:01,160
He wants 3-4 things. He can eat maybe 50 but he wants now 5 things only.

252
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:07,410
So I always have to push into new stuff sort of “which you want? What you want?”

253
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,510
- You have another child?
- No.

254
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:12,990
- She is afraid to have another.
- You’ve had enough with one.

255
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:19,000
- It’s not enough. I’m scared for him, for me, it’s our struggle.

256
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,240
- One is ok but why don’t you have another child?

257
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:28,170
- No, she is afraid that he is going to be autistic and that’s what I say, it won’t, right?

258
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:34,330
- They told you that the other child may be…?
- No.

259
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,320
- There is no such a chance.

260
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:46,070
- You see? I’m trying to persuade her to have.
- You are healthy, your husband is healthy.

261
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:56,490
He was born healthy. He was made sick with the vaccinations and antibiotics.

262
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,340
That’s very clear.

263
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:10,240
So everyone who will be hammered by all these introduction with the chemicals

264
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:16,600
into the body will break down. There’s no problem…

265
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:23,480
- Can I tell you about his eating maybe?
- His eating habits.

266
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:30,150
- Maybe he doesn’t drink water at all. He drinks juice, orange juice...

267
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:35,680
- Aversion to water.
- Yes. And he doesn’t crave bread.

268
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,660
Now here because he didn’t have much and craved a little bit of bread

269
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,420
but at home he doesn’t want bread.

270
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:57,920
- Doesn’t like sweets. I didn’t like when I was a kid but he really…at all… nothing.

271
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,420
- 3 times.

272
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:09,750
- This is very unusual in Canada not to like sweets for the kids.

273
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:16,020
- His father likes sweets.
- Always. A lot.

274
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,460
- Is there any other peculiarity about his…

275
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:29,360
- Well, he doesn’t like to try new food…I put tomatoes

276
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,360
because he likes everything of tomatoes… Like salsa. But not the fresh.

277
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,240
Everything made from tomatoes he eats but not the fresh tomato.

278
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:44,970
It’s just the way some things are made.

279
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:56,550
- His feet always sweat and are smelly sometimes.

280
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,780
- Offensive?
- Yes.

281
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:06,530
It’s offensive but they are often wet. Whether he has fever or not.

282
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:11,030
I actually remember giving him sil at one point during the fevers.

283
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:16,030
- Salt?
- He like salt.

284
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:25,760
- That means he adds salt.
-  No. He doesn’t add on his own.

285
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:32,010
If I put on cucumbers lots of salt he likes it he licks it. He likes salty.

286
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:36,020
But he doesn’t ask for things yet.

287
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,260
- Meat he eats?
- Meat, yes.

288
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,520
- Sausages?
- Not anymore.

289
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:48,020
He used to like sausages but not anymore. No daily. Just meat.

290
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,180
- When the meat has some fat in it he likes it?

291
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,270
- I think he is ok.

292
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,280
- He’s not picky at that.

293
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:07,180
- Likes cold food. I warm it up, I put it and he waits.

294
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,030
- That’s another reason I gave him sil.

295
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,850
- What do you say?
- He’s very anxious.

296
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:21,840
- Well sometimes he’s scripting from the movies that he likes and he picks up the sentences

297
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:29,350
and he’s like repeating them.  But his understanding now is way more…

298
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:35,830
Now in this situation he knows he is being observed. And he’s like anxious.

299
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,350
- He’s hiding. He’s observing other people.

300
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:43,350
- When it is safe at home he can communicate way more.

301
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,340
- He articulates properly.

302
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,090
- He speaks and reads and writes and does presentation at school

303
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,750
but he’s just very nervous now.

304
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:06,500
- Plays by himself. You know autistic children cannot play with themselves.

305
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,100
He can say with himself and be creative. Plays and uses his imagination.

306
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:14,600
Plays with other kids too.

307
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,250
- Eggs he eats?
- No.

308
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,510
- He’s allergic to eggs.

309
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:25,170
- Allergic but you think he likes them? You don’t know.

310
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:36,550
- After tub he started eating cheese.
- …

311
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,940
- Dairy allergy was cured by tub.

312
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,420
- Something peculiar. He likes to open holes.

313
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:56,530
When there is a hole he puts and he makes it big so he tears it.

314
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,790
- He touches his genitals often too.

315
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:08,260
- That started maybe 2 years ago. Off and on. Sometimes more, sometimes less.

316
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,860
But it’s still there.

317
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:16,500
- Also he likes the sensation on the skin from something soft.

318
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:21,590
He will take a blanket and put it in his pants or shirt…

319
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:30,270
- Or squeezes. He like rough games…

320
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:36,270
- In the summer he likes to walk undressed?
- No.

321
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,840
- When he goes to the toilet he goes by himself?

322
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:48,240
- Yes he can go. Sometimes we go together but yes he goes by himself more and more.

323
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:51,160
- Does he play with the stool?

324
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:56,510
- No he doesn’t. I didn’t see him play. Never.

325
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:09,410
- I don’t think he likes actually mud. I like to paint. He doesn’t like to paint.

326
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,760
He doesn’t like to get dirty.

327
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,910
- He will ask her to wash his hands.

328
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:23,150
He used to play a lot in the sand and then he would just wash his hands. He doesn’t like them dirty.

329
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:28,510
- The sensation of sand calms him down.

330
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:38,740
- Has he shown any aggressiveness towards some other children?

331
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:47,740
- No, never. He likes to have people, to console them if they are crying, to say “it’s ok”.

332
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,490
Big empathy. So he likes to put fingers in his mouth.

333
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,230
- He puts his fingers.

334
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:01,100
- Yes, not all the time but occasionally.

335
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:15,650
- He loves music and dance. Water, fishing, beach. Loves water, sea, ocean.

336
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:19,650
- You mean the sea water or in the swimming pool.

337
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,490
- Anything.

338
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,800
- Is he sleeping by himself?
- No.

339
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:44,050
He sleeps beside us. On the side. He was sleeping in another room when he was 1 year old.

340
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:49,300
We put him in another room because he was breast feeding all the night. I couldn’t sleep at all.

341
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,560
- Teeth grinding?

342
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:58,310
- No, he was breast feeding in the night and then in the first year

343
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:07,230
we put him in a nursery in another room and he was there for almost 1 year.

344
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:17,240
And then Helen told us that maybe he needs to be with us and then we put him back to our bed.

345
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:23,220
But he was not waking up all night.

346
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:30,580
- He was ever afraid of the dark? You had to leave a light on?

347
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:36,720
- At that time I don’t know. I think he didn’t like it definitely being alone in a room.

348
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:42,470
But we always put a light on, there was always a little light.

349
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:46,310
- A small one.
- It wasn’t dark completely.

350
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:57,170
- You are now working, yourself?
- Part time.

351
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,070
- What kind of work?

352
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:09,480
- I’m teaching at the college, interior design. Like inside architecture.

353
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,880
- You studied architecture.

354
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,280
- And she is a painter too, she is an artist.

355
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,400
- You like to paint.

356
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:23,050
- She just said that he wakes alone when he wakes up in the morning and it’s dark, it’s fine.

357
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,390
No problem

358
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:35,150
- He likes gardening with mama, flowers…

359
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,550
- Have you ever given him a lemon to see how he reacts if he eats the lemon,

360
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,960
desires the lemon?
- No.

361
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:51,060
- It’s hard to test new food on him because he doesn’t like to try.

362
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,460
- Oranges?

363
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:59,890
- He loves oranges, yes. And orange juice. He drinks orange juice like water.

364
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:01,380
- Fresh orange juice?

365
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,310
- Well, no we don’t make it, we buy it.

366
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:18,060
- You don’t have fresh oranges in Canada?
- He eats fresh oranges.

367
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,620
- Fruits? Other fruits he likes?

368
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,450
- When he was 2 years old he ate everything. Green… everything.

369
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:34,540
I was making everything for him because he was allergic.

370
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:44,310
So after that he started the picking. Now he eats lots of cucumbers. Me too.

371
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:51,940
Oranges and bananas, sometimes apple, but he can eat all the fruit.

372
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,160
He was eating before, he just doesn’t want to eat them now.

373
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:02,430
Watermelon, oranges and sometimes banana.

374
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:09,200
- He accidentally hit my leg with his leg just slightly.

375
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,970
But he thought he hurt me so he wanted to kiss my leg.

376
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:20,480
And I saw that he was going to kiss my dirty shoe and I said “No, don’t!”

377
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:27,710
and he got scared of my reaction. Closed his ears and crawled under the bed.

378
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:39,300
So you cannot talk even a little bit loud to him. When she is upset or cries, he is very upset.

379
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:44,970
- Sensitivity to sound but it was really bad at one point last year actually,

380
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:49,550
when you left for Greece and after carc.

381
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,450
- He got much better after carc.

382
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:59,300
- He was much better after that. Now it is just high pitch noise.

383
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:08,800
- I don’t think he is scared I think it just hurts him; he has sensitivity to it. I’m not sure.

384
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:15,840
- In autism it’s common that they get overwhelmed with everything.

385
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:22,450
With him it’s mostly with sound. He wants harmony around him that’s for sure.

386
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:32,820
He doesn’t want any problems, anybody being hurt, anybody being angry or sad.

387
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:41,200
- He doesn’t like his food to be changed but he loves to travel.

388
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:46,040
So he loves the change in a big but not in a small level.

389
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:53,130
It’s like he needs a little of around him to keep him calm to keep him out of anxiety.

390
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:58,700
But we told him about Greece and about airplane and bus and boat.

391
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,400
And he was so excited, he wanted to go. He enjoyed the whole trip.

392
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,700
But when we got in Athens he asked for orange juice, his orange juice.

393
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,410
I told him “No orange juice.” He said water is ok.

394
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:19,140
He wants his little meals to be the way he likes it.

395
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,370
But he likes to travel, he likes to see new places and people.

396
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,980
So he has that adventurous side of him.

397
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:37,120
He likes running. As auto stimulation, in a room sometimes he goes like back and forth,

398
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,620
not as much. Before it was in circles.

399
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:47,740
- As a stimulation or to calm down?
- That one yes, to calm down.

400
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,080
- He is riding a bicycle.

401
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:58,340
- But if he runs too much he starts having some asthma symptoms.

402
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,240
- Ok?
- Ok.

403
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,550
- Thank you.

404
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:33,830
Ok, first of all I must say that the improvement from the original state is quite impressive

405
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:45,350
and most probably is due to the 3 remedies out of those you gave, the carc,

406
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,610
the tub and the ant-t.

407
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:02,690
The question is what I see at this moment, what is the most probable picture.

408
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:16,430
It’s not a clear picture. There are several possibilities like caust, hyos, pall.

409
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:26,140
There is also a possibility, asar is a possibility but I don’t know how it will develop.

410
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:35,270
Now, what is the way to come down to the most probable remedy at the moment?

411
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:47,570
Which is an interesting feature of the boy from what we observed.

412
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:58,780
He has some strong symptoms of caust. But what impressed you?

413
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,250
Looking at the child what impressed you?  Yes?

414
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:15,970
- I noticed that he was very restless. Obviously he was anxious at the beginning when he came in.

415
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,140
He wanted to hide when he came into the room.

416
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:24,140
But then he started peeping out from behind to see what was going on.

417
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,650
And afterwards when he was more comfortable, he was more outgoing

418
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,980
and he was performing his dinosaurs, trying to spy you out.

419
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,890
So he came over quite open as far as he could, concerning his condition.

420
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:44,640
Communicative, but he always went to the safe base of the father or the mother in order to hide.

421
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,980
That’s the external only.

422
00:42:53,240 --> 00:43:03,730
- It’s very interesting for me to see how much usually the mother,

423
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:14,900
almost never the father is identified with the children of that type.

424
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:26,720
The mother tries to understand and to explain and they need to explain why the boy is running.

425
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:36,130
Because there is a logical explanation that the boy will not do something beyond logic.

426
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:41,880
And they need that and they identify themselves so much.

427
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,590
- He was singing all the time.

428
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,750
- Who, the boy?
- The boy.

429
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,400
- The voice of the mother?

430
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:55,560
- No, nobody noticed that during all the interview he was singing.

431
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,150
All the interview he was like this.

432
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:08,920
- Yes. Is this correct Helen?

433
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:19,600
- I think he was kind of whimpering. He was whimpering into his mother.

434
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,830
- He was singing or making noise?

435
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:29,270
- He moans a lot when he is sick. His asthma or cough or whatever.

436
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:35,680
And he moans in sleep and he moans when he is sick.

437
00:44:52,940 --> 00:45:14,590
- What is the moaning, lamenting? You can use it. Put it twice.

438
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:27,250
- If something happens like after one really bad asthma episode his mother said “Ok,

439
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,480
you’re safe now”.

440
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:37,240
And he cried and cried. He gets into pieces and cry for a very long time.

441
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,730
- His mother says “You’re ok”,

442
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:45,980
- I think it was after this trip to the hospital. Cause he couldn’t breathe at all.

443
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:56,880
He gets very bad. So she said “You’re ok now, you’re safe now.”

444
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,880
And he started crying.

445
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:05,150
And he does that from time to time if something happens he will cry and cry for a long time.

446
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:19,720
[…] He wasn’t affectionate when I first saw him. He became like that later on.

447
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,040
This is when I prescribed phos.

448
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:32,650
So when I saw him being affectionate with such a difference that was a year and a half ago.

449
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,160
- How he was?

450
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,370
- I suddenly saw an affectionate child. He wasn’t like that at all at first.

451
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:42,360
He was only in himself just like a little animal.

452
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,870
- There is a big improvement there is no question.

453
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:49,860
- But when I saw him being so affectionate I prescribed phos

454
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,040
and he got much better with phos too.

455
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:59,730
And phos worked on his asthma and for a long time and then stopped.

456
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:16,070
- For me watching him the most impressive is the antics, what he does with the grimaces,

457
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,530
he is making antics, with play and all that.

458
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:43,720
This is what in our repertories seen as playing antics. Put this. Show me the remedies.

459
00:47:45,460 --> 00:48:02,990
Hyos is the only capital and bell. But this is a characteristic of hyos actually, quite strongly.

460
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:18,060
What you saw is what we know hyos is doing. And grimaces also another expression.

461
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:24,230
Playing antics means he is performing.

462
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:43,080
Ok hyos is there as one so therefore show me the…

463
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:57,950
Hyos seems to be the indicated remedy especially why?

464
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:02,280
Because he says lately he is touching his genitalia.

465
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:13,020
That was confirmed by the mother quite a lot. So if we see the symptoms covered by hyos;

466
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:20,770
handles genitalia, grimaces, aversion to water also.

467
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:24,520
It’s interesting that hyos has aversion to water.

468
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:35,770
And grinding teeth during sleep, moaning, perspiration rattling, sensitive to noise,

469
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:46,280
asthmatic respiration and desire to hide also with playing antics. Desire to hide was combined.

470
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:56,770
From this remedy missing the fact that he has aversion to sweets so strong,

471
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:09,800
which I would like to have, the oranges desire, the aggravation from eggs, foot offensive,

472
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:29,520
caries, discolored. What I would to have aversion to sweets that comes from the mother also.

473
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,600
It’s almost a hereditary thing the aversion to sweets.

474
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:41,840
So it’s quite deep, maybe later on I will go to caust with the affection

475
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:45,590
and the sympathetic element will remain

476
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:54,950
but I think hyos is going to help further the development of the child.

477
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:09,110
After that the aversion to sweets will remain.

478
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:16,830
The sensitivity to others and the sympathy will remain most probably

479
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:34,470
and I don’t know what effect will be with his allergies. He has an allergic asthma.

480
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:46,610
It’s quiet severe, I don’t know how much hyos will control this or you will need the next remedy.

481
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:57,260
Most probably will make the asthmatic condition better but he would need another remedy definitely.

482
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:05,800
And most probably he will need caust as the next remedy.

483
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:16,010
But at this moment where the shyness, you see no shyness at all he is not shy, he can perform,

484
00:52:16,110 --> 00:52:20,250
he can do whatever he likes. He doesn’t care what you think.

485
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:26,010
That kind with playing the antics and the grimaces and all that

486
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:35,270
and the touching of the genitalia plus the other symptoms brings us to the idea of hyos

487
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:50,220
and what is the potency? You see the child was damaged by vaccination and antibiotics,

488
00:52:50,320 --> 00:53:02,770
the combination actually. And that is why you were able to bring up such improvement.

489
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:15,520
Children who are born straight away autistic are very difficult to improve.

490
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:22,410
But it they’re damaged through antibiotic or vaccination

491
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:30,910
or the combination it’s much easier to have some good effect.

492
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:43,180
I believe this child can be quite improved and maybe at the age of 15-16

493
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,590
he will be almost normal.

494
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:52,410
- They didn’t see him when he was not anxious. There is a tremendous difference.

495
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:56,180
Then he was a little animal, now he is a human being.

496
00:53:57,210 --> 00:54:05,080
- It’s amazing what homeopathy can do in such cases where no other treatment

497
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:11,760
as far as I know can have such an effect.

498
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:18,160
- I wanted to ask if he had a very big desire for oranges…

499
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,420
- Yes, med is also a possibility.

500
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,920
- Also the mother said when they didn’t allow him yesterday to go to the sea

501
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:31,490
because it was cold. He punished them because he really wanted to go.

502
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:45,000
- Also another thing with hyos is, I forgot, this stool. To have stool is a hyos symptom.

503
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:51,380
- But he didn’t say about stool if I understood well. He said that he makes…

504
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:57,820
- It’s an explanation of the mother. This is just nonsense.

505
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:04,330
A normal child would punish by doing that… It has to be a symptom.

506
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:06,370
Either there is another explanation.

507
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:14,040
He wants to punish, he has stool… Of course the fact that he allows a 7 year old

508
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:18,080
to have a stool it’s a symptom.

509
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,580
- But did she say stool or soil?
- Soil.

510
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:27,510
- She said soil. 
- It’s the same. Stool.

511
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:32,190
- Is it? I didn’t understand that.

512
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:42,590
- I like this explanation. The mothers explain away everything.

513
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:47,330
“He does this because of this, he does the other because of that”.

514
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:51,840
In fact you have to see the whole picture.

515
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:59,930
It’s a child that plays antics, that touches his genitalia, he has stool,

516
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:07,760
not controlling his stool and then becomes a picture.

517
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:18,690
She thinks he does it under certain psychological pressure. Whatever the pressure might be.

518
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,510
- Hyos had a strong fear of water.

519
00:56:27,530 --> 00:56:34,080
- Fear of water? No, he said aversion to water. Does not want to drink.

520
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:43,960
- He loves to play with water that the mother said and hyos has strong fear of water.

521
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:49,990
- Also a lot of other remedies have fear for water.

522
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:59,100
The fact that a symptom is missing from a remedy it doesn’t mean anything.

523
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:02,590
- It’s not missing. It’s just the other way round. Someone can have fear,

524
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:04,590
someone is loving the water.

525
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:11,800
- Yes, but what’s the problem. There is no problem. That’s natural to like the water.

526
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:20,470
He just simply does not have fear of water he has aversion to water.

527
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:24,470
- But it is also his sycotic background that he loves the sea…

528
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:32,570
- Yes correct. Most probably later on he will need some med.

529
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:38,570
I didn’t want to embarrass the couple asking whether the father…

530
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:45,570
You asked? Denied. You don’t think.

531
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,490
- No I just said the sycotic background is from the mother who is staph all the way.

532
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:57,680
Staph treated her depression, her neck pain, throat, everything.

533
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,650
She was a kind of a child.

534
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:06,170
She might have contributed to his problems because she was really an abused child.

535
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:11,560
At the age of 13 she would clean the whole house and prepare food for her parents.

536
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:17,010
And mother would come and say “Why didn’t you clean this? Why didn’t you do that?”

537
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:23,510
So at the time he got sick there was a very very difficult conflict.

538
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:27,100
- You belong to the feminist movement.

539
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:37,170
- The potency you can start with 200CH.

540
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:46,360
You give every day 200CH for a few days, see the reaction and then if he’s better

541
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:51,420
and then worse, then you may repeat as long as long keeps on playing the antics

542
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,860
doing all this kind of performance.

543
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:02,650
When that keynote is gone most probably you have to search for the next remedy

544
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:18,750
which most probably I think it can be caust, can be med, can be pall, can be asar.

545
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:37,000
High fever. Because he has high fever we consider him to be treatable, curable.

546
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:46,450
Just because his immune system has the possibility of developing a high fever. He’s curable.

547
00:59:47,500 --> 01:00:09,310
Level 5 or 6 you can say.  The fact that cortisone interfered during this that was bad.

548
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:21,410
But you immediately saw the reaction the boy was chaotic immediately. Can go to level 7 quite easily.

549
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,650
- Why do you consider pall?

550
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:42,560
- Because he needs so much approval from others. That is a characteristic of pall.

551
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:56,910
And if that remains. Of course it’s just an idea. The most probably is caust, med.

552
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:11,060
- For this little boy he had his teeth at 4th month and he was talking at 9 months

553
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:16,520
so he was really early. You understand?

554
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:20,570
- He was talking quite early. At 9th month.

555
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:33,150
- And had his teeth at 4th month. Do you consider this is a factor of sensitivity?

556
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:45,550
You know what I mean? He’s early in his development, maybe also in the brain system,

557
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:50,090
so maybe he can be touched much more than any other.

558
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:57,570
Because a lot of children have antibiotics and vaccination and they don’t have anything.

559
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:04,300
- That’s correct. What you are saying most probably has a relevance that means

560
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:14,880
because the organism was fast in developing he had some certain extra sensitivities

561
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:20,050
and because of the interference of the vaccination

562
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:25,650
and the antibiotics brought the whole organism down.

563
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:34,000
- From your experience can you please guide us in what case we should go with X potencies?

564
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:39,510
In what cases we should go with centesimal…

565
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:48,550
There is a lot we read in the books who prescribe X potency multiple times.

566
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:55,460
So far until now I have not received any final standpoint from where we should go on X,

567
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:59,300
or should go centesimal…

568
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:08,380
- When you want to go low we may go to X. 12X, 8X, 9X.

569
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:22,550
If you want to go very low you can go to quintecimal potencies which are very light.

570
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:37,540
1 to 50.000. These are very light remedies and you can repeat them always. Like Patel. LM potencies.

571
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:52,220
But in my experience I don’t have to use LM potencies so…

572
01:03:52,320 --> 01:04:00,800
If wanted to go low I go to 6X. Very low. 6X is the lowest.

573
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:12,280
- In that particular case if we go to 1M then to 10M then to 50M then to CM.

574
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:16,280
Still the same remedy is indicated…then?

575
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:27,490
- MM. Million. Tell some pharmacy to make you one million.

576
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:32,200
- So my question is I know a case of…

577
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:41,460
- Actually the old times the used to give these remedies. It’s not a joke. But what they did.

578
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:52,290
They put a jet of water and then they had the potency and the jet of water

579
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:59,510
went into washing out all the time and they had calculated

580
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:09,270
that if they let it for instance for 3 hours the water that goes in and out

581
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:20,850
within 3 hours it’s 1 million times. Still, they say it worked. I don’t know.

582
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:27,740
- After CM… I know a case of motor neuron disease it is a case of caust

583
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:32,940
I started with 200CH I raised the power. Now it is on CM.

584
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:38,630
I give him CM whenever he has some exacerbation of the problem.

585
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:43,020
Otherwise I stick to the placebo. Now I am stuck up.

586
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:49,120
Indications are the same but I don’t have a higher potency. So what is your opinion on that?

587
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:57,120
- Take the CM and potentize it a few times. Just to make it a little bit stronger.

588
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:03,440
And if that doesn’t work then you can start all over going back

589
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:07,540
and start with repeating 12X frequently.

590
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:17,310
- So in that case Erik has taught us that high potencies antidote low potencies.

591
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:24,780
So suppose, if a patient comes to us and we have given him CM potency

592
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:31,510
and if he comes after 6 months or one year should we start with CM or we can time from any time?

593
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:36,860
- You can start normally from the last potency.

594
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,870
- He has already taken CM but he comes after 1 year.

595
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:46,460
- After 1 year you give again the last potency. That was CM.

596
01:06:50,200 --> 01:07:03,830
Also concerning his question that this child has not fear of water

597
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:11,080
therefore you will not give hyos. This is not correct, why?

598
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:20,840
Because in 100 cases of hyos perhaps the fear of water will be in 2.

599
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:32,940
All the 98 cases they have no fear of water. 98% do not have fear of water.

600
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:47,830
- Once again I have a doubt here because I see that you don’t take into consideration

601
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:56,790
a symptom that was very clear… Because hyos doesn’t have these 2 symptoms.

602
01:07:56,890 --> 01:08:01,660
- You are speaking a little bit fast for me. I did not take into consideration that…

603
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:12,410
- 2 symptoms; ailments from antibiotics and vaccination. Hyos doesn’t have them.

604
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:14,580
- So what should I have given?

605
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:24,990
- Stram because stram has both of them. Stram has all the rest; the antics, the grimaces...

606
01:08:25,090 --> 01:08:33,180
- Stram is much more aggressive. We are talking about aggressiveness.

607
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:46,760
He will hit, he will provoke, shout, he will see nightmares. It’s another picture.

608
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:51,250
And fear of the dark, strong.

609
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,490
Ok, thank you.
