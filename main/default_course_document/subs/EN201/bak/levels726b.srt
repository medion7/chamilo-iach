1
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,940
- Engaged?

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:23,020
- Yes. Girlfriend for 16 years, engaged for 3 years.

3
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,260
- But you know each other for 16 years?
- Yes.

4
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,490
- You have been together for 16 years and 3 years ago you are engaged finally

5
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,580
and in another 15 years you will marry…
- Maybe

6
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:52,450
- It’s a good arrangement. We must be taught by him. How he does it.

7
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:08,200
So this is a case of sleeplessness for 20 years and he got coff,

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:19,430
he had received quite a lot of remedies of course and he got coff

9
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:29,430
and this is the second follow up now?
- First follow up.

10
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,580
- You had I think the first follow up after a few days?

11
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
- Yes.

12
00:01:48,760 --> 00:02:05,500
- You took Coff 10M 2 times.
- One time in the beginning.

13
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,820
- One time but you took again coff in middle of October

14
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:23,840
because the sleeplessness started coming back and you took 50M in the end of November…

15
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,570
- And all of these again because you told me so.

16
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,820
- Because from 10M you had no effect.

17
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:41,180
So after coff 50M slept better for 1 month but sleeplessness came back again.

18
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:48,900
Have had 3 colds since he began with coff with high fever?

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,160
- One time high fever.

20
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,340
- And what did you take?
- Nothing.

21
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,590
- Still pain and stiffness in the knee and pain in the wrist.

22
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,860
Then who told you to take phos?
- You.

23
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,480
- Because fears are still there, had some epistaxis,

24
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,720
sleeplessness is still there but not as before.

25
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,570
- That’s my own words.

26
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:42,470
- And then on the 14th of March you took lyc.

27
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,480
I gave you lyc?
- Yes.

28
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,970
- What did you write to me?
- I had some stress that influenced me.

29
00:03:50,070 --> 00:04:02,070
I was falsely accused for something. Someone accused me for something that I didn’t do.

30
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,810
- Somebody accused you, made you mad but you did not attack him?

31
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:12,410
- No, I did not do what I was accused for.

32
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:19,810
This is big for me. I’m too kind I see the best thing in all people.

33
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,080
I lose because of this.

34
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:30,320
- No effect from phos, had some stress that influenced me,

35
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:38,220
you had some accusation from some friend or…?
- Yes.

36
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,510
- Friend?
- Yes.

37
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,010
- What was the accusation, can you say or you don’t want to say?

38
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,520
- No, I don’t want to say.

39
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,030
- Ok. But you were innocent, you haven’t done anything?

40
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,900
- Yes.

41
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,520
- I felt anger with myself and some anxiety.

42
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,930
- Yes anger with myself because I keep getting in trouble because I’m too kind.

43
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,010
I lost 100.000 euros when I was building my house

44
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,020
because I trusted the persons who built my house because I’m too kind.

45
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:20,020
- I see. So, present symptoms; sleeplessness still there but not…

46
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:27,610
- This is completely back. It was one month ago when I wrote this.

47
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:35,460
- That means you cannot sleep the whole night?
- It takes several hours before I sleep.

48
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:45,600
- “Still very sensitive to noise especially when I am about to fall asleep

49
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,460
and a sudden noise comes then it almost impossible to sleep.”

50
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,540
Have been constipated lately?
- No.

51
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:06,360
- “Also if someone, dog or girlfriend is breathing loudly next to me.”

52
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,360
You sleep with the dog or the girlfriend?

53
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,350
- Or both. I’m very sensitive to noise.

54
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:22,700
- You mean your dog is sleeping in your bed?
- Yes. I love animals.

55
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:35,080
- “Brain is still active but not as before. Sleep is deeper.”

56
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,090
So if you sleep for some hours that is deep sleep?

57
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,680
- Yes.

58
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,420
- You cannot still wake up if there is some noise?

59
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,510
- Yes, I still wake up but maybe not as easy as before.

60
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:59,440
- “Knee is more painful and stiff, worse when having knee erect, standing,

61
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:11,430
walking slowly and having the knee bent.” Lumbar pain you have worse standing,

62
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:24,160
walking slowly, lying on back for long. You sleep on your back or on the side?

63
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,420
- On the back. When I am asleep it is on the back,

64
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,110
when I’m going to sleep I turn all the time.

65
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,590
- Do you have nightmares?
- Sometimes.

66
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:47,580
- When you have a nightmare you always wake up lying on your back or you cannot sleep?

67
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,440
- Always lying on back I think.

68
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,090
- You became more hot or more cold?

69
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,090
- After lyc I think I also put the feet out of the covers for a while

70
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:13,430
but not anymore. I have the feet under the cover here in Alonissos, so it’s not outside.

71
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,940
- Pain in the left side of the neck under the scapula

72
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:30,580
but under the left side of the neck is here and the scapula is very down.

73
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,510
- No, left side of the back.

74
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:51,350
- Wrist is worse since a couple of weeks. Ganglion is bigger and more pain.

75
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,830
- But that is going up and down.

76
00:08:52,930 --> 00:09:00,340
But it has been much better than before I received coff and the other remedies.

77
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,240
- The anxiety and anger with my self is almost gone.

78
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:17,600
- It almost went away directly after lyc. I also feel more confidence.

79
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,010
- The fears are still there. What are the fears?

80
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,090
- Fears… snakes.

81
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,080
- Fear of being alone?

82
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,830
- Yes, I don’t like that because of the things that happened to me before.

83
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,420
- So you want to have somebody?
- It can be the dog.

84
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:50,520
- Or anybody… but has to be in the house.
- Yes, only in the night.

85
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:13,820
- “Lately felt some pain in heart region, cold and draft aggravates,

86
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,330
desires are the same, chocolates and sweets and spices.”

87
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:29,600
- Chocolate is underlined four. At least. I love chocolate.

88
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,750
- How much you can take?
- Very much.

89
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,500
- One block of chocolate?

90
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,600
- No problem. I can take several times a day. One big block.

91
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:53,360
If I start to eat I can’t stop but I do not do it often because it’s not so good.

92
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:09,830
- How is your energy in general?
- It is good.

93
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:16,070
- How is your emotional in general? You feel happy, you feel depressed?

94
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,170
- I feel good.

95
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,660
- And you would like to sleep more. How many hours you sleep now?

96
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,900
- It depends but sometimes now… When we were going to Alonissos I slept 2 hours,

97
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:39,410
I went to bed maybe at 23.00 and felt asleep maybe at 1.30, so I slept 2 hours

98
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,160
but it’s ok, I can function anyway.

99
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,160
- You can function even with 2 hours of sleep?

100
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,410
- Yes but I don’t want to have this problem

101
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:53,010
because when I’m lying there and turning it’s disturbing.

102
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:04,500
- So you become restless in bed actually.
- Yes, kind of restless.

103
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:15,960
- Your reaction to weather, how is it now? Normal?

104
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,900
Are you bothered by heat here very much or cold?

105
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,330
- What bothers me from heat is perspiration. I don’t like to perspire.

106
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:33,670
But I can function with heat, no problem. I don’t like cold weather.

107
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,320
- Sun you like? Can you sit under the sun here?
- Yes.

108
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,670
- You take it easy.
- Yes.

109
00:12:51,920 --> 00:13:05,180
I also have a new symptom that’s pain in this side. That has been more lately. After lyc.

110
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,940
- Pain on the left temple.

111
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,930
- What else?

112
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,820
- It can be worse sometimes when I’m turning my head to the left.

113
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,910
- It can be worse the pain?

114
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:44,740
- Yes, but not always, sometimes. And also I have sneezing from drafts. Not now.

115
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,860
- It’s a new symptom or you had it in the past?

116
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,580
- I’m sensitive to draft but I cannot tell if it’s a new symptom.

117
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,990
- Would you say you have anxiety about your health?

118
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,830
- No.

119
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,180
- You eat meat?

120
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:20,260
- No, only chicken and fish and no fat. I don’t like fat. Aversion to fat.

121
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:31,260
- But you like chicken and you like fish.
- Fish not so much. Chicken I like it.

122
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,430
- Salt? How much?

123
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:48,650
- I like salt. I would like to do it but I think before I eat.

124
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,900
- You control yourself not to put extra.

125
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,160
- I could put very much salt. When I eat French fries

126
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,250
and pop-corn I put a lot of salt.

127
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:21,750
A new symptom also is that I was sitting in the sun for 2 hours this week

128
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:28,330
and I was too red, I never became so red. So I burned myself.

129
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:43,590
I never do it like this easily, I’ve never been so red on my legs.

130
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:54,220
- Do you think that you are an open person, you can talk about yourself easily?

131
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:01,400
- Yes, I have no problem talking about myself but I sometimes I can be a little shy

132
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:09,010
because I cannot find the right words but if I can find the right words, I can talk very much.

133
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,310
- Are you able to cry easily or you cannot cry?

134
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:34,570
- I can cry but mostly when I’m alone. But it depends I think.

135
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:40,320
Much easier now than a couple of years ago maybe now I can cry in front of others

136
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,080
but I prefer to be alone.

137
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:49,820
- Would you like somebody to say “Come on” if you cry, come to console you,

138
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:57,070
you will like it or it will make you irritated?

139
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:02,650
- I think it will make me irritated but I’m not sure if I will like it.

140
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,750
Maybe I will like it.

141
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:21,860
- Here you go to the sea to take a bath. You can stay under the sun?

142
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,370
- Yes.

143
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,550
- You can tolerate the sun?
- Yes.

144
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,200
This is the first time that I go swimming,

145
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:36,700
before I was lying under the sun for some hours maybe but now I’m swimming,

146
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,290
I didn’t do that before a couple of years when I was here.

147
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:50,690
- Before you used to lie under the sun for hours and you would not go to the sea;

148
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,270
now you go to the sea…

149
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,580
- Yes, but now it was warmer this year.

150
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:05,520
- And now you go to the sea straight away and you stay more in the sea than outside.

151
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,700
- No.

152
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,670
- Still you stay outside under the sun?
- Yes.

153
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:16,410
- But you are not sunburned. 
- Maybe not so easily.

154
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,770
- You sit under the shade?
- No.

155
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,070
- You had pain in the knee. It’s more painful and stiff.

156
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:56,070
- Yes the pain in the knee and the stiffness came after the coff.

157
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,000
I felt some stiffness and some small pain after coff maybe 2 weeks after

158
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:08,000
and then I was training with the boxing bag and then the day after there was pain.

159
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,240
- The pain started and is still there?
- Yes.

160
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:21,490
- In the left knee… Do you know if you had gonorrhea?

161
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,420
- No, never.

162
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,830
- Do you feel easily insulted if somebody says something…?

163
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:35,440
- No problem.

164
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,340
- You get angry very easily?

165
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,920
- No, I don’t think so, only with my girlfriend.

166
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:57,280
- And then you hit her?
- No. She knows the buttons to push.

167
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:30,840
- If you don’t feel well and somebody comes to console you, do you like it?

168
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:39,350
You don’t know or you know?
- I like attention.

169
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,330
But I don’t know if I like it.

170
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:50,360
- By the time you are really in a bad mood if somebody comes and says “come on…”

171
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,610
- If I’m in a bad mood I don’t think I like it but if I am sad maybe

172
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,710
then I would like it.

173
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,870
- How much salt you use?
- A lot.

174
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,120
- How much is “a lot”?

175
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:14,010
- Very much but I don’t use it because I think about my health.

176
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:22,190
- But your instinct is to take the salt and put it before you even tasting it?

177
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:27,040
- Only in pop-corn and in French fries, then I do it always.

178
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,120
- Still desire chocolate.
- Very much.

179
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:17,270
- You like consolation? If somebody comes and say “come on” when you are angry

180
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,520
or when you are...
- I’m not sure.

181
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,630
- You are not sure.

182
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:42,090
- If you were free to use salt would you use as much as you like?

183
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,110
- I think so.

184
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,360
- How much would you use? Can you give an idea? I mean…

185
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,600
- I would eat salt directly. I would salt my food.

186
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,850
- All your food?
- Maybe.

187
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,590
- Whatever it might be.
- Maybe.

188
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:10,360
Not on the sandwiches but hot food. Spices I would also…

189
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:16,600
- Do you like if you are in a bad mood somebody to come and console you?

190
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,110
To say “come on, don’t worry”

191
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:23,200
- No, I don’t think I do when I’m angry, maybe when I’m sad.

192
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,260
- Not when you are angry.

193
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,360
- Maybe that would irritate me more.

194
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,440
- What you wrote desires are the same; chocolate and sweets.

195
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:56,060
You forgot to put the salt?
- I forgot. I love salt.

196
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:08,680
Also cookies I can eat a lot. I cannot stop to eat when I’m started,

197
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,030
I take several cookies in my mouth at the same time.

198
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,850
- You have a good appetite?
- Yes.

199
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,850
- Did you put on weight since last time?

200
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:28,210
- I also have some bloatedness. After eating and drinking.

201
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:45,590
- When you are sad, when you are angry if somebody comes to console you,

202
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,840
you will accept it or say “leave me alone”? You like rather to be alone.

203
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,190
- When I’m irritated I think I want to be alone.

204
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:13,010
- At this moment, you feel that you are more open than previous years?

205
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,000
- I think so.

206
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:24,590
- Or you rather go to yourself and brood in case something happens.

207
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:32,940
- No I’m more open. I don’t have a problem to talk to people about my problems.

208
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:57,510
The guilt feeling I had before is also completely gone.

209
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:36,070
- Also you had written you had pain in your heart, in the muscles rather you had reported.

210
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:40,820
How is that?
- It comes now and then.

211
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:49,810
It’s not a big pain. But before, many years ago I had this pain.

212
00:26:49,910 --> 00:27:00,320
I think it was between ribs and I could only take small breath maybe for a whole weekend.

213
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,990
I was like that Friday-Saturday-Sunday.

214
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:06,920
- Do you remember what age you were?

215
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,640
- Maybe the last time I had it was a couple of years ago but not so severe,

216
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,910
it was more severe when I was younger.

217
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:22,980
When I was 7-8 I fell from the roof and I landed with my hand here

218
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,000
and I think it started after that.

219
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,820
But the pain in the chest that I have now it’s not the same,

220
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:44,320
it comes sometimes when I breathe. I don’t know if it’s a kind of stitching pain,

221
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,420
it’s a vague pain. But it’s not often.

222
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:07,090
- You are open with your girlfriend? You will tell everything to her?

223
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,750
- Yes.

224
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:18,250
- Your parents? You are talking with them?
- Yes, maybe not everything.

225
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:39,330
- If the food is oily or there is fat in the food you will like it you will take it?

226
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:48,440
- I don’t like fat in the meat but I can take fat food at sauces.

227
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:56,990
But not fat on the meat, I would never eat. Not slimy food.

228
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:08,000
Or if there is some cartilage on the chicken I would stick it out.

229
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,240
- Ok. Alright.

230
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:57,220
- Who knows the remedy? I want to see hands. Strange.

231
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:20,590
Some you know the remedy and you are afraid to make a mistake. The remedy is clear.

232
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:37,560
Dimitri, which is the remedy? Elia, which is…? Yes! Why are you afraid to talk?

233
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:53,640
It’s a nat-m case. After coff, which took away the extreme intensity in the nervous system,

234
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,160
then the nat-m is manifesting.

235
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:10,980
Desire for salt, aversion fat, he has all the symptoms of nat-m, what is the problem?

236
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,240
Consolation, I did not ask…

237
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,140
What else?

238
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,890
I asked about salt, I asked about fat, I said if I ask for consolation

239
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:55,490
and go to the class and next ok… everybody will know the remedy.

240
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:12,720
You see what made you vacillate or not be sure,

241
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,560
you know what it is? That he said he likes the sun.

242
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:25,060
That made you suspicious, maybe your idea is not correct

243
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:38,410
but if an organism has so many keynotes of a remedy and does not have the usual,

244
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:49,180
worse sun, worse from exposal to the sun, then no problem.

245
00:32:50,400 --> 00:33:19,990
Because the… karma of this fly it was ended. She has sacrificed herself.

246
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:34,790
The other day it was a Japanese girl sitting there and when she saw me do it

247
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:54,720
she went like this. What was her remedy? Killing a fly.

248
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:06,310
What? Aethusa? No, I’m just joking. You cannot give a remedy

249
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:11,130
because somebody is reacting in this way.

250
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:19,650
It shows a kind of super sensitivity which is not natural.

251
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:35,100
So, sleeplessness from grief also is typical of nat-m,

252
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,100
people who have gone through lots of grief, they cannot sleep.

253
00:34:48,250 --> 00:35:01,440
And what are the symptoms of nat-m? Difficulty falling asleep…

254
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:18,370
Med is the first on the symptoms. Why we prefer nat-m? Because instead of med,

255
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:24,190
nat-m has some of his keynotes symptoms.

256
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:37,220
Nat-m is the remedy which has to be given in high potency.

257
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:49,700
Let me see, desires salt, aversion fat, desires chocolate, cold aggravates,

258
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,020
you see cold aggravates? Nat-m is there.

259
00:35:53,730 --> 00:36:03,450
Drafts of air aggravate, sleeplessness from activity of thoughts.

260
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:13,090
You see nat-m has one of the heaviest sleeplessness we have in the M.M.

261
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:26,420
They can go through the whole night without sleep, especially where there is grief

262
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,040
and because of grief there is sleeplessness.

263
00:36:31,610 --> 00:37:02,140
This is a case of nat-m. So nat-m here, he had some more… Spices, aversion slimy also…

264
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:13,690
and you could see he does not like consolation.

265
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:37,030
So, nat-m what potency? He is strong you can give any potency you like, no problem.

266
00:37:37,130 --> 00:38:03,800
His organism is very strong. Potency, Dimitri? 50M. I agree. Starts with 10M.

267
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:18,600
So, 10M , you just take one dose and maybe there is an aggravation.

268
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:30,990
Do not be bothered, wait and call within 2-3 months.

269
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:35,630
You have to wait before you give a report, ok?

270
00:38:43,190 --> 00:39:05,840
Who thought of nat-m now? Everyone should think of nat-m in this case, it is very clear.

271
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,180
What confused you was the fact that he was lying in the sun.

272
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:19,180
No, it did not confuse some but some others were confused because…

273
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:43,450
Yes, sir? Say it again. Trusting? No it makes him healthy on this level.

274
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:52,630
He doesn’t have to have all the symptoms of nat-m from A-Z. Yes?

275
00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:09,760
What level? The level you are until you have some… but you had already a high fever.

276
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,770
– One year before this last one.

277
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:32,090
– You are high level in health, don’t bother. If you don’t damage yourself with other things,

278
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:37,190
which are bad habits, you can live.

279
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:45,420
You have to reduce the chocolate a little bit but you see,

280
00:40:45,520 --> 00:41:02,670
he is also careful about his diet. That is characteristic of nat-m. They will not eat.

281
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:09,260
They will need salt but they will resist. They need chocolate,

282
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:31,170
they want to resist as much as they can. And they try to eat more healthy food.

283
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:40,440
Nat-m can up to the point of being hypochondriac.

284
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:57,760
It can go as far as… He is not that far but he is careful with diet,

285
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:03,360
with what he is doing at this moment.
