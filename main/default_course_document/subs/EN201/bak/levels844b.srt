1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,910
Ok, we can start.

2
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:34,990
I have seen one year ago and the main problems were peripheral neuropathy,

3
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:47,550
eczema on hands, abscesses on the teeth, pain in right hypochondria,

4
00:00:52,060 --> 00:01:08,560
phobias and anxieties and the remedy that was prescribed was Bac 200CH.

5
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:29,910
Is this the last report? 
–Yes.

6
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,810
– The overall reaction was an aggravation without amelioration.

7
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:45,560
“I had an aggravation with my headaches, impaired hearing from mental exertion,

8
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:53,560
developed other few new symptoms like faintness and vertigo from heat,

9
00:01:53,660 --> 00:02:14,850
restless mind full of thoughts, I was not able to rest and to do something constantly,

10
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:23,360
waking early with busy mind, pain in stomach after eating.

11
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,080
There was no change in my main complaints

12
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,090
so I wrote a report describing my original set of symptoms

13
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,410
before I started being treated with homeopathy. I thought it might be good idea”.

14
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:50,420
So you wrote to me…
- Basically this.

15
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,020
What it is stated here. I wrote you the same list of symptoms.

16
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,160
– Original symptoms 10 years ago;

17
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:12,160
low grade fever most of the day, the worst time was always 4-8, offensive urine,

18
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:22,170
great weariness, flushes of heat in head especially after coffee or heavy food,

19
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:31,170
perspiration on scalp after the slightest exertion or in sleep, falling of hair,

20
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,020
indigestion and nausea after having fatty food.

21
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:43,030
Wounds healing slowly, muscles regenerates slowly after exertion.

22
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:56,770
Before Bac you have taken several remedies.

23
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:25,510
Ars, Psor, Phos, Cham, Lyc, Syph, Sulph and some others.

24
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:33,170
How many others?
– Quite a few I don’t remember.

25
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,600
At least 20 more. French homeopathy before…

26
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:52,420
- Then you wrote the report.
– You gave me Lyc.

27
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,770
– I gave Lyc what potency?
– 200CH.

28
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,920
–But you had Lyc in the past.
– Yes, I did.

29
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,170
– So  what happened with Lyc?

30
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:14,470
– There was again an aggravation and then back to the original state, no amelioration,

31
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:22,820
but some new symptoms appeared and some of mine previous symptoms got more intense.

32
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:26,650
– So you wrote another email.

33
00:05:37,320 --> 00:06:10,710
– Basically I got Lyc at the end of October and then I wrote a report after Lyc.

34
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:17,650
I think it was 3 months later. I waited for 3 months after Lyc.

35
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:28,990
And then I wrote another report about the reaction to Lyc.

36
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,970
– You don’t have the email to read?

37
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:53,630
– I’m sorry but the information is pretty much the same. I wrote to you I think in February.

38
00:06:53,730 --> 00:07:05,650
– February 18th so most probably…
- No February 18th it was later on.

39
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,630
– “There are some news that my state is progressing. I took another dose of arg-n”.

40
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,880
– This was after prescription of arg-n.

41
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:19,490
– The arg-n, I prescribed…?
– Yes, you prescribed.

42
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:28,390
After the Lyc. Because some symptoms of this remedy emerged.

43
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:35,640
– This is what I’m trying to find. Where are the symptoms.

44
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,490
– The symptoms are here.

45
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:51,640
–“ Eructations after eating, ticks, restlessness of extremities,

46
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,950
have to do something constantly, superstitiousness.

47
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:09,630
So I took another dose of arg-n 9CH in the morning”. So you took just one dose?

48
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:15,890
– You prescribed twice a day 9CH for one month.

49
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:20,630
I took only one dose and I got a reaction after one dose.

50
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:30,220
– “After one 9CH according to what I have seen in my throat it looks like tonsillitis.

51
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:39,230
My left tonsil is more painful on swallowing, whereas my right tonsil is more coated with pus.

52
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:47,710
The left one is also coated but less. The pain is worse on swallowing.

53
00:08:47,810 --> 00:09:01,560
Also feel pain in the right hypochondria. The highest fever since yesterday it was 38,5C”.

54
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,060
Before you had low fever.

55
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:17,900
– Well for 10 years, I had almost no fevers.

56
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:24,050
– But before 10 years you had constantly, low fever, hectic fever.

57
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:30,980
–The original very syndrome was 37.1-37.2C.

58
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,210
– So that was the first time that you developed after many years?

59
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:42,460
– Not actually I developed such a fever after some remedies for example Psor

60
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:55,230
but only for a few days but not the tonsillitis. The tonsillitis I didn’t have for 10 years.

61
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:03,890
– You mentioned “My problems started 10 years ago with mononucleosis

62
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:10,240
which was misdiagnosed as tonsillitis and treated with antibiotics”.

63
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:19,290
So actually this was the manifestation of the old condition of mononucleosis.

64
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,470
– It seemed to me the same.

65
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:29,550
– “ Since then I have not had tonsillitis symptoms until now.

66
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:36,630
For all these 10 years I have still felt a pain in the left tonsil.”.

67
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,130
That’s all.
–Yes.

68
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:53,060
– And then I responded, what did I say?
– I think you said to take a dose of Lach.

69
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:06,210
It must have been 18th February because it started the night before.

70
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:14,260
I got the fever at 9 at night.

71
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,380
– I did not tell you to check your blood?

72
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,990
– Yes, you did but two days later.

73
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:39,140
– So I said take Lach 30CH one dose. And you took.

74
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:45,230
And what happened?
– Nothing.  It did not help.

75
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:52,840
And then I think it was on the left side and then it got worse from warm, didn’t help.

76
00:11:52,940 --> 00:12:00,330
Then I wrote to you another email it just got worse and worse. The pain was worse.

77
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:07,190
I was more exhausted. I really didn’t know what to do

78
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:20,380
because for 2 days or something you were not responding so I took myself Merc.

79
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:32,130
And in between you contacted me and prescribed Nit-ac. And that helped very quickly.

80
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:48,680
– And what happened with nit-ac?
– It helped. Very well, very quickly. Good reaction.

81
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:58,590
– And the infection, how long it lasted?

82
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:21,010
– For 3 or 4 days it was very strong. I took the nit-ac…

83
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:26,110
- What potency?
– 30CH several doses.

84
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,180
– You repeated the dose once every day or as needed?

85
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:41,500
– You said to take it every few hours, every 2-3 hours.

86
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:52,760
Then I managed accordingly to this thing along with intervals.

87
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,750
I took less often  because I was feeling better and I stopped completely.

88
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:04,210
–And eventually became better and better. 
– Yes very quickly.

89
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,060
It only took about a week…

90
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,120
- But it was quite dramatic as I remember.
– Yes, it was.

91
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,860
– You were quite in a bad state. There was tremendous pain.

92
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:32,350
You called me actually on the telephone. And you said you were totally exhausted.

93
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:37,880
Why don’t you say? I can’t remember all of this.

94
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:48,040
– So it seemed the same infection like this one 10-11 years ago when it all started.

95
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:57,630
– The mononucleosis you had 10 years ago. It seemed the whole syndrome was coming back.

96
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:10,800
And the main point was that the pain was really excruciating and constant.

97
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,190
- You mean why did you prescribe… 
- The tonsils…

98
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:21,040
- Only on swallowing.

99
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,820
-By the moment you called me it was terrible I thought you will die in a few days…

100
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,670
- Yes it was terrible but only on swallowing.

101
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:47,670
The tonsils were swollen… like tonsillitis but quite progressed.

102
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:59,320
– I had a problem with you because it seemed that you were suffering a lot and…

103
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:07,320
- Yes but don’t forget that I am anxious. I might be exaggerating.

104
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,590
– Until I gave you the Nit-ac.
– Yes.

105
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:26,240
– Then I realized what it was happening but the last time you took nit-ac was 2 or 3 months ago?

106
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:37,330
– At that time, in February. It was only for the acute. Then I didn’t take anything.

107
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,240
I just repeated arg-n…

108
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:48,220
- You repeated. How many times?
– Once. You told me to repeat.

109
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,650
– I told you to repeat it when?
– One month ago.

110
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,490
– Because, why? What did you have?

111
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,840
– Because I wrote you that chronic state is the same…

112
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:10,850
- The pain in the tonsils…?
– No, the chronic syndrome, the neuropathy.

113
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:18,060
– The neuropathy, the tingling.
– Yes. It is more numbness.

114
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:26,350
Like wearing glass or something. But after the infection it was over.

115
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:34,850
At that time and even later on I started having aggravation in the chronic complaints,

116
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,700
after the infectious.

117
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,520
– After the infection the chronic complaints started coming back?

118
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:51,290
Or they were there all the time?
– No.

119
00:17:51,390 --> 00:18:01,200
My main complaint is the numbness and the weakness, the neuromuscular complaints.

120
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,420
Then I took the infection, you treated the infection with nit-ac

121
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:15,470
but before the infection came up after arg-n.

122
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,220
– The infection came after arg-n.
– Yes.

123
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,300
After the infection was over then my chronic complaints started aggravating.

124
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:37,530
– But your general state was the same as before or now it was better.

125
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,780
– You mean after the infection?
– After the infection.

126
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:49,890
– First there was an aggravation and then slowly some improvement in some areas.

127
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:59,390
– So in the report you say ”complaints after mental exertion significantly better.

128
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:08,970
And I feel more mental power. I am able to work more, I do not get tired so easily.

129
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:19,610
Ticks are still there but are better. I have had them there since childhood.”

130
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:32,870
Which you call ticks?
– I try to hide, to control but I make things.

131
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:41,450
Some movements with the eyes, some compelling movements.

132
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:46,700
– This you remember started after the mononucleosis.

133
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,820
– No. I had it as a child. For quite long.

134
00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:06,360
– If you remember in the childhood you had a severe acute that you were treated for?

135
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:13,890
– I don’t know. I had several times tonsillitis with high fevers.

136
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,810
Even at the age of 18, I had high fevers still.

137
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:36,300
– “My physical energy is slightly better about 10%.” Why you say 10% only?

138
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,780
Because as you said before you started working and you could take the work.

139
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:58,640
– Mental work. The improvement is in physical energy 10%.

140
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,030
But mental energy got much better more than 10%.

141
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:15,130
– How much?
– 30-40% like that. Maybe 50%. I am not sure.

142
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:31,280
– “Pain in stomach and hypochondria is less frequent. I have not put on weight so far“.

143
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:38,030
You stayed at the same weight?
– I’m underweight. I can’t put on weight.

144
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,710
– How many kilos are you know? 30?
– No, 50.

145
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:58,730
– You look 30! You’re 50 kilos. 
“I have not put on weight.

146
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:09,140
My main complaints are better about 10%.” Are you sure 10%?

147
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:20,500
Today you feel any improvement which continues slowly or you feel it stopped?

148
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:31,890
Be very careful because I may make a mistake here and everything will come back.

149
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:37,150
–Are we talking about now, today or the months before?

150
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:41,640
When I wrote this report it was about a month ago or two months ago.

151
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:47,980
– That’s why I ask because there is a month interval between you wrote this report and now.

152
00:22:48,080 --> 00:23:00,340
– So you’re asking now, how I feel now.
– Yes, now.

153
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:14,640
– It is better in some respect. When I touch something the sensation it is more or less the same.

154
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:22,430
But it is better in a sense that it does not aggravate so easily.

155
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,830
– If you do something, does not aggravate.

156
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,830
– So easily. It takes more time until it aggravates.

157
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:36,070
– So you can do more things without being aggravated.

158
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:41,920
When you say “I’m aggravated after exertion” what do you mean?

159
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:51,250
– These complaints are aggravated mainly by writing, typing on a computer, playing my guitar.

160
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,760
Mainly these 2 things.

161
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:16,160
– Now you can play the guitar for how long the most? 1 hour? 2 hours? 3 hours?

162
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,340
– Yes, maybe 2 hours.

163
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:35,830
– Before how long could you play the guitar? 20 minutes?

164
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:43,060
–No. One and a half hour.

165
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:51,300
– And now you can play it for 2 hours. So that means… how much percent is this?

166
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:58,530
Do you know?
– It is really hard to say.

167
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:07,130
–Like 10%, 20%, 25%, 35%?
– I would say 10-15%.

168
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:19,380
– Actually what you say is more than 20%. It’s 25%. But it doesn’t matter, really.

169
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,940
I just want to understand.

170
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:30,690
“The numbness gets worse after the exertion but now it takes more time before it aggravates.

171
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:39,950
However I have not had a full sense of touch in my fingers for about 10 years

172
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:51,870
and still do not have full touch. I feel like wearing rubber gloves all the time.

173
00:25:52,870 --> 00:26:00,350
It is a fact that I have been working on a computer a lot recently

174
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:07,600
which aggravated the problem the most.” Why? Because of tiredness?

175
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:13,100
How long you work on the computer?
– Quite a lot recently?

176
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,950
– 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours? 
– Something like that. With breaks.

177
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:32,690
– “My eczema got worse even when it is not winter now.”

178
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:44,270
– Now it’s gone at the moment but a about a month ago it was not bad at all,

179
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:54,460
but usually I have in winter only. But after the arg-n I have it also in spring.

180
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:12,850
But I have some information, if you like I can give you notes of the actual “now” state.

181
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:20,020
Because one month ago my mental state got worse again.

182
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:33,270
I was more tired, I couldn’t work again and I had this pain after mental exertion in my head.

183
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,270
– You had a pain on the vertex, on the top of your head.

184
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,360
– In the left side.

185
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,440
– In point?
– Yes.

186
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:51,020
– You had a point headache after exertion.
– Yes last year when you were taking my case.

187
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,760
– How is that now?
– It’s much better.

188
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,620
– Better or gone?

189
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:12,190
– I sometimes feel it when I  work very much but only…. It is gone.

190
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:19,950
– Can you tell me this pain with which remedy went away?

191
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:32,870
– It went away after arg-n.

192
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:10,270
– So when I asked you to do a blood test then you sent me of the 23rd February

193
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:24,450
and you said that the blood test sedimentation rate was 30 in the first hour or you don’t know?

194
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:35,530
They say 30 just  one number. They don’t say 30 first hour, 30 second hour…

195
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,620
The monocytes were 10.

196
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:51,020
They also made an Epstein- Barr virus antibodies test and a throat swab.

197
00:29:51,120 --> 00:30:00,540
“Results of these should be available on Monday”. What were the results of the swab?

198
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:21,870
– There was no bacterial infection. The Epstein- Barr test showed… not the acute infection.

199
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:34,460
I had it already before. 5 years ago or something.

200
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:47,450
– But it was compared to 5 years ago? The numbers where the same or you don’t remember?

201
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,200
– I didn’t have a chance to see.

202
00:30:52,950 --> 00:31:12,370
But the doctor said that definitely I must have encountered this infection at some point in my life.

203
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:23,020
It is very probable, she said. The monocytes ten. I was already feeling better.

204
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,510
They took my blood at the point I took when nit-ac had acted, I was already feeling better.

205
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,520
– When I asked you to take it immediately you said “I’m too sick I cannot…”

206
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,010
– No.

207
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,870
– This this what you told me over the telephone.

208
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:45,350
– The problem was that I came to the doctor the day where she was there only in the afternoon

209
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:51,950
and the laboratory did not perform in the afternoon, so I had to come next day morning.

210
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:59,860
So we had one day delay. In between I didn’t want to wait of course then I took nit-ac…

211
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:09,650
- But you did the test immediately after I told you to have a test? No, I don’t believe.

212
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,660
I remember you delayed quite a lot.

213
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,650
– At the first point I think I didn’t understand.

214
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:28,150
– You symptoms were as- a symptomatology syndrome -

215
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:34,640
were for me equal to mononucleosis at the time.

216
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:40,080
That’s why I asked, but you seemed no to be able to go.

217
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:46,820
I don’t remember for what reason you told me “I cannot go now”. You found some reason..

218
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Maybe you were exhausted… And then finally you went. But it was already gone the syndrome.

219
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:06,910
– The monocytes were 8-9 or something like this for all these 10 years.

220
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,320
– The monocytes were high all these years.

221
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:27,000
– But in my country it is normal to have 8-9 monocytes.

222
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:34,870
– The interesting is you said that nobody performed any blood test

223
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:41,320
when you had the original tonsillitis. They did not suspect that…

224
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,650
- No, that’s way they gave me antibiotics.

225
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,740
– They gave you antibiotics and brought about all this.

226
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,080
– Most probably.

227
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,500
– And I did not know you had mononucleosis. You never told me.

228
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:07,830
– Last year you said it to me. I described and you said that most probably you had that.

229
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:17,070
– Then you had complaints, some pains in the thighs. Do you remember?

230
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:22,320
And then I asked you the pain in the thighs are not mentioned. What happened?

231
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:29,070
– Oh yes this was during the acute. I had pain in the thigh during…

232
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:37,760
- But disappeared?
– Yes it was just during the tonsillitis.

233
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:58,400
– The cervical glands… how long it took to get away?

234
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,250
– A few days, 3-5 days.

235
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:12,990
– “Swelling on tonsils slowly reducing… I have a lot more energy than 2 days ago.

236
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:22,910
But I am still a bit weak. There is still general malaise but I feel better resting.

237
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:30,640
I feel more the pain and pressure in the right hypochondria now.

238
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:36,980
Since yesterday I also feel a bit nauseous now and then.

239
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:43,230
Two symptoms were present during the original infection 10 years ago.

240
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:56,490
My general impression is that it is exactly the same infection as I had 10 years ago.

241
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,810
I looked in my medical documentation

242
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:11,860
and found out that monocytes were slightly higher 12% in blood test

243
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,700
performed 2 years after the infection.

244
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,950
During the original infection no blood test was performed."

245
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:55,350
So let me now understand your present situation.

246
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:09,420
What do you feel now has to be improved mostly? The tingling?

247
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,760
– Yes the numbness.

248
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,440
– This is the main.
– Numbness, weakness.

249
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:25,590
– Your appetite is good?
– It’s good, normal.

250
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:30,590
– You eat like a normal person? Like me?
– No, not at all.

251
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:42,620
– You eat less?
– Not less but I cannot tolerate some food.

252
00:37:44,100 --> 00:38:03,570
– Which food?
–Fatty food, fried, some raw onions, spicy things.

253
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:12,090
– Have you ever examined your gallbladder?
– Yes.

254
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:17,250
– And it is ok?
– Ok. But I have pain here… but it is ok.

255
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:29,080
– I say it is not ok.
– But it is better after the arg-n.

256
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:46,150
– Better after arg-n. It’s functioning not well. And it is giving you this pain with spasms.

257
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,260
– But the pain is not very intense.

258
00:38:50,640 --> 00:39:05,260
But if I eat very often fatty food, after several days I will get nausea and sense of discomfort

259
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,840
and pain on both sides.

260
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:10,530
– Do you eat eggs?
– Yes.

261
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:15,080
– You like eggs?
– Normal. I can eat them.

262
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:22,750
– Do you eat them really or forget it?
– No I eat them.

263
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,670
– Every day one egg?
– No every day, it’s a lot.

264
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:29,520
Twice a week or something like that.

265
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:34,080
–If you eat egg there is a problem in the gallbladder?

266
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:41,830
– No. I have this tension of flatulence after eggs.

267
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:47,330
–After egg? Have you noticed this?
– Yes.

268
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:56,580
– After onions you have also flatulence or discomfort in the stomach?

269
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,470
What is that bothers you?

270
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:08,590
– It is not that after one onion I will have the pain but onion is one of the things

271
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:15,760
which I know I should not eat because if eat it for several days then I get this pain.

272
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,000
– If you eat it repeatedly.
– Yes.

273
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,740
– The onion… you like?
– Yes.

274
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,340
– The garlic?
– I like.

275
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:35,500
– But the onion if you eat it repeatedly will give you a pain or will give you distention?

276
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,430
– The pain, no distention.

277
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:44,680
– What else will give you distention or pain?

278
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:56,180
– I’m not sure but I think pastry gives me flatulence, sweet cakes.

279
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:20,680
I didn’t notice anything else but in general before arg-n I had a lot of gas, this is now better.

280
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:31,350
I have also very frequent eructations. That’s why you prescribed. Now it’s better.

281
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,850
It’s almost gone after arg-n.

282
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:49,430
– The urination has a smell?
–No it was many years ago. When it all started.

283
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:54,260
– Your urine was offensive.
– Yes.

284
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:04,740
– What kind of offensiveness? Do you know the urine of the horse? Have you ever smelled.

285
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,380
–No.

286
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:12,580
– Anyhow it was a heavy smell.

287
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,930
– It was strong, I don’t know if it was heavy but it was strong.

288
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:28,170
It was like sometimes I had a feeling that what I eat the smell is similar to what I eat.

289
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:59,660
I think quite often it was like some grains and especially like buckwheat if you know how it smells.

290
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:09,410
Sometimes it appears also now but it is no that heavy.

291
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:27,400
– So the tingling is the most and then some food which still disturb you…

292
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:40,550
Do you drink water a lot? You’re thirsty?
– Yes.

293
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:54,080
Before arg-n for many years I have drunk about 4 liters a day. I take big glass…

294
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:03,470
- Cold?
– Not very cold, normal. But I drink a lot.

295
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:10,570
But after this arg-n I drink quite less. The thirst is less.

296
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:24,990
– The tingling you feel it in the whole or in the fingers?

297
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:35,730
– The most is in the tips of the fingers but it starts on the wrists both hands. Both whole hands.

298
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:41,080
– Both hands but mostly on the tips or the whole?

299
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:48,670
– I think it depends, it changes. Fingertips are most.

300
00:44:51,910 --> 00:45:01,510
It is not tingling. It is numbness. Like a rubber.

301
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:17,760
Sometimes I feel burning and sometimes it is just different. But it is also sometimes here.

302
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:28,000
– Right or left more?
– I think it started on the left.

303
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:36,060
– But when it started on the left? You remember?

304
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:44,810
– When I had this mononucleosis 10 years ago then I started homeopathy treatment

305
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:49,660
and during the homeopathic treatment after some time it started.

306
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:54,790
– Did you receive phos during that time?

307
00:45:54,890 --> 00:46:00,260
– I don’t know. The homeopath had not told me. I don’t know.

308
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,320
But I had phos quite recently.

309
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:08,660
– After you took it yourself or somebody gave it to you?

310
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,560
– I can’t remember. Yes, somebody prescribed.

311
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,660
– I see that you have taken phos.

312
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,980
When you urinate have you noticed the urine to be fogged?

313
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,830
– It is not.

314
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:34,840
– Did you ever have any warts?
–Yes. All fingers. Here.

315
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,750
– You have a lot?
– Not now.

316
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:45,500
– You had. And how they disappeared.
– After some remedies. Ars.

317
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:55,250
– When did you take ars?
– 3 years ago.

318
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:07,080
– You perspire now?
– No very much.

319
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:11,670
– Your perspiration has a smell?
– No.

320
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:21,470
I perspire on the scalp very much before I started any homeopathy treatment.

321
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:22,470
– Before?

322
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:29,570
– Before I took any remedies I was perspiring very much on the scalp.

323
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:39,580
– In scalp or on the top?
– The whole hair.

324
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:53,900
– Before nit-ac or before arg-n?
– No 10 years ago.

325
00:47:55,910 --> 00:48:00,050
– You perspired a lot.
– Yes after slightest exertion.

326
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:05,150
– Not now?
– Not now anymore.

327
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:16,550
– Do you desire something to eat? Do you have special desire?

328
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:24,150
– I like cheese, tomato sauce.

329
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:30,870
– Not tomato?
– I can eat but the sauce…

330
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:45,110
- You mean ketchup?
– Not very much. The real sauce.

331
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:49,200
– Not tomatoes?

332
00:48:49,300 --> 00:49:02,380
– No I like tomato but not as much as the sauce. But I don’t like sauce in general.

333
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:12,380
– In childhood you had fear of the dark. How is that fear now?

334
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:24,050
– Well sometimes if I am alone in the dark I don’t feel comfortable but it is not a fear.

335
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:43,110
–Fear of ghosts?
– As a child. Now not so much.

336
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:47,960
– UFOs you are afraid of?
– Not now. As a child.

337
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:57,210
– Fear of dogs?
– As child now not anymore.

338
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,200
– Your mother is alive?
– Yes.

339
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,900
– You are still clinging to your mother?

340
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:19,710
– No. But as a child I was very much connected to her.

341
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:26,110
– Felt very bad in the summer camp longing for parents.

342
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,960
– Yes.

343
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,620
– Very sensitive to my parents quarreling, it was very dramatic.

344
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,960
Listening in the next room and waiting until they stop.

345
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:49,970
How much salt do you need? Normal? You put extra salt in your food?

346
00:50:50,960 --> 00:51:05,190
– I don’t put salt before I taste. I always taste first. I like a little bit more.

347
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:16,440
I don’t know what’s normal but compared to my girlfriend I take more.

348
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:19,340
– Sweets?
– Yes.

349
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:28,190
– More than salt?
– The same. I like sweets.

350
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:42,940
– You were never infected with venereal diseases?
- No.

351
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:52,430
- How is your psychological state now? How would you describe it?

352
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:21,510
– For some years I have been quite… not relaxed… tense.

353
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:34,440
I am quite anxious about myself, about my health.

354
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,860
–About your parents?
–No.

355
00:52:50,360 --> 00:53:02,250
– You say also in your childhood you were compelled to harm yourself

356
00:53:02,350 --> 00:53:09,520
putting wire into the plugs.
– Yes I had such impulses.

357
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:19,170
– “I did not do it. Got frightened, what a silly idea I had.

358
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:27,170
One day I felt into the glass table and injured myself and a piece of glass dug into my back,

359
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:35,640
ended up in the hospital. Important it was the reason why it happened. I was compelled to do it.

360
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,100
To fall into the glass.”

361
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:47,330
– Not fall. I was walking on it, as a child. But I knew that the glass was thin and it could break.

362
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:52,430
– It broke and you fell down?
– I knew it can break…

363
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:01,580
- “ I used to stand on this table several times before.

364
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:09,080
When I got back from the hospital I was very happy that I was at home with my parents.

365
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:17,850
That evening I got a fever without any other symptom. And next day it was gone”.

366
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:25,100
Fever from fear.
– I know I was happy…

367
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:36,340
- “ I had otitis a few times, tonsillitis… hay fever…

368
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:43,930
In 10 years I remember having strange fear of death before going to sleep.” You still have it now?

369
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:52,260
–  No it was a kind of panic attack.

370
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,650
– Do you eat fruits?
– Yes.

371
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:00,660
– You like fruits?
– Yes.

372
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:08,090
–Tell me again the things that bother you. Onions?

373
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:13,820
– It is not only onions. It’s many things. But I can tell you…

374
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,320
– It’s the fatty things. This is the first.
– Yes.

375
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:22,170
– The second is…? The onions? Or you cannot say?

376
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:29,810
– I can’t say exactly. I can just say that if I’m on diet

377
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:34,810
which is supposed to be for patients with liver, gallbladder…

378
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:39,510
- Good food.
–Yes. Then I’m ok.

379
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,020
But some other foods… I have problems.

380
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,740
– But cheese you can eat as much? How much? Half a kilo?

381
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,240
– I never eat it much because I am afraid of…

382
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:05,820
- When you desire such of that you may eat…

383
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:14,510
- No I can’t have it 3 times a day. 3 times a day is too much. It’s not so strong.

384
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:27,900
– You have a girlfriend. Are you in love with her?
– Yes.

385
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,750
– You have strong feelings?
– Yes.

386
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,580
– Ok, good.

387
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:08,500
This case is an example of what I am going through every day

388
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:14,100
with hundreds of people I have undertaken.

389
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:32,400
He forgot his very low key but he said that “I’m dying” and I was so anxious I had to telephone him

390
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,250
because I could not get in touch.

391
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:44,070
I said “How are you? Are you still alive?” he said yes. I have a double problem;

392
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:51,070
the one is that I don’t have the patient when there is a follow up,

393
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:55,080
I do not have the patient to talk.

394
00:57:55,180 --> 00:58:06,380
So whatever the patient is writing to me I respond. And this is not good many times.

395
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,880
But I try to do my best.

396
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:29,390
But this case has been complicated because of wrong treating mononucleosis.

397
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:36,060
Mononucleosis treated with antibiotics, it can destroy the organism.

398
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:46,930
And needs very good homeopathic treatment afterwards to replace the damage.

399
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:54,890
What happened with him the treatment was given it was totally wrong

400
00:58:54,990 --> 00:59:10,650
and aggravated the whole situation. So it became very complicated case.

401
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:27,230
But still this is an example case that if you do the correct way

402
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:38,550
that means giving one remedy observing the reaction and the going according to the symptoms

403
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:47,970
there is a time when the organism even if it appears that your remedy is wrong

404
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:55,630
the reaction the organism is giving if the remedy is close enough in a case

405
00:59:55,730 --> 01:00:00,960
which is complicated you cannot see the remedy if the remedy is close enough

406
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:06,310
eventually it will push the organism towards the right direction

407
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:12,110
and eventually you can see more clearly the remedy.

408
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:20,350
He was in a terrible state the moment I realized this is a nit-ac situation.

409
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:25,550
I believe the next day he says “I was much better”.

410
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:36,430
Where he could not eat at all he was totally exhausted the pain it was terrifying,

411
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:53,310
“what shall I do? I am not going to be alive.” And I am going through the same problem with him.

412
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:20,550
I believe that the effect on the nervous system it was created most probably he was given phos.

413
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:26,960
In the beginning after the mononucleosis.

414
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:35,340
I wanted to tell you something also about the yesterday case

415
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:43,320
when you did not agree and you said most of you this is a phos case. You remember?

416
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:54,930
So I have to tell you to be careful because if you don’t have symptoms strong for phos

417
01:01:55,030 --> 01:02:07,280
and there is a kind of let us say a small ulcer and you give phos which is wrong it will bleed.

418
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:18,350
So if you give phos to this case yesterday with the several ulcers in the stomach lining

419
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:28,120
the next thing you get is bleeding and maybe strong bleeding and has to go to the hospital.

420
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:43,410
In such a case I would be very careful to have absolutely strong confirmatory symptoms.

421
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:58,100
Thirst. The thirst for cold water if the stomach is involved is necessary for you to prescribe phos.

422
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:12,790
The organism wants to control the bleeding and how controls the bleeding?

423
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:23,140
By taking in cold water so the arterioles are contracting, are not loose so it can break out

424
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,000
and then bleed.

425
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:30,620
Once you see that the organism needs the cold

426
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:36,060
because I don’t know what they do now in bleeding in the stomach

427
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:45,810
but the old time they used to put cold even outside in the stomach.

428
01:03:47,430 --> 01:04:01,150
Ice. And cold… whatever they drink. Not hot. So if the person says “I have a stomach ulcer.

429
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:07,670
And I like warm water” forget it. Don’t give phos.

430
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:22,400
I didn’t want to scare you yesterday but I thought I have to tell you. Just to be careful.

431
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:27,260
Because you will find the person is in the hospital.

432
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:44,750
We have several possibilities. One, no remedy. That’s the best. Second. Repeat nit-ac.

433
01:04:44,850 --> 01:05:08,560
Third possibility. Give another remedy. So which one you prefer? The logical thing in such case,

434
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:18,430
the best thing of course is to wait because he received a dose of 30CH, 2 months ago the last…

435
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:36,840
For the acute it doesn’t matter. The beautiful thing in his case is that he got back all the syndrome

436
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:41,990
that he went through 10 years ago.

437
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:52,090
That is very important showing that his health has improved tremendously.

438
01:05:54,590 --> 01:06:03,600
So that is very important and it is best not touch the case.

439
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:37,140
Unless -which is the law- you have a clear picture of the remedy.

440
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:47,260
Then you can be justified, go ahead and prescribe it.

441
01:06:48,920 --> 01:07:01,240
You saw the struggle I went through in this case, trying to find out which was the next remedy.

442
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:06,840
The computer did not help, I had 2 computers, we compared,

443
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:13,790
we tried to find out what this computer what the other computer I did not like anything…

444
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:18,680
It was showing both of them phos.

445
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:27,660
There is a possibility that later on he may need some phos but not now.

446
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:44,880
Now what is the remedy… Since he is here he has the opportunity he cannot come very easy.

447
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:52,990
Can you fly easy to Greece? No. So I have to give him a possibility.

448
01:07:53,740 --> 01:08:02,280
So let us see, first I will show you the case analysis. Show me the symptoms.

449
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:22,550
Anxiety about health underlined 2 times, ticks, stomach fat, nausea after fat,

450
01:08:22,650 --> 01:08:33,230
pain right hypochondria, numbness in the hand on writing, numbness on fingertips,

451
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:55,640
weakness upper limbs, eruptions in winter, put 3 times, fat aggravated, onions aggravates,

452
01:08:59,730 --> 01:09:08,730
desires onions and if you ask for analysis see now what happens.

453
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:28,740
The analysis shows Lyc first, chel second, phos third, podo, nit-ac, ars, thuja, lept, nux-v.

454
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:48,750
Now change, go back to symptoms and change numbness hand on writing and put it 3 times

455
01:09:53,210 --> 01:10:07,130
and also fingertips 3 times. Eruptions in winter 3 times. And show me.

456
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,740
Phos, zinc. Zinc has come up why? Explain zinc.

457
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:36,110
Zinc has some strong symptoms on the numbness and ticks and weakness in upper limbs,

458
01:10:36,210 --> 01:10:58,310
is missing quite a lot. Ok then? Lyc, forget it. Rhus-t. Go down. Chel. Only 4.

459
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:10,800
The chel is interesting because he has the right hypochondria problem

460
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:21,820
which is the gallbladder in his case and also desire for cheese that was the first he said “I want”.

461
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:29,370
Also the numbness in the fingertips and weakness in the upper limbs.

462
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:38,210
So actually Chel covers his pathology the most.

463
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:50,130
Because chel is a specific remedy of course for gallbladder with a specific desire for cheese.

464
01:11:55,800 --> 01:12:01,370
Actually his pathology now is something

465
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:31,750
which is due to lack of absorption of some microelements

466
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:52,970
which nourish the nervous system and that is forbidden by the gallbladder function.

467
01:12:53,510 --> 01:13:05,890
The gallbladder function does not give the proper enzymes to have a better digestion and absorption.

468
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,380
Matter of fact.

469
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:30,620
I ask him if this pain is really extending somewhere and he it extends to the left

470
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:40,430
but sometimes deep inside appears extents to the back, not only around,

471
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:54,210
he says right behind to the back which again is in support of chel and gallbladder function.

472
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:12,300
So therefore what we may decide is to wait for six months

473
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:22,610
and if the gallbladder problem becomes really bothering and strong

474
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:28,610
then he may try with one dose of chel 30CH.

475
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:38,620
Also do not get the idea that homeopathy cannot do damage.

476
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:46,210
Homeopathy can also suppress a situation.

477
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,910
Do not think it’s so innocent.

478
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:10,800
- […] And he mentioned I think when he was answering your question

479
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:16,880
“My primary problem is still unresolved” and one of the primary problems he says

480
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:22,230
that he had it since childhood and that was ticks.

481
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:30,550
He also says all the investigation does not point anything significantly wrong with gallbladder.

482
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:37,540
So I am not able to understand why we are not looking at the primary problem

483
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:42,100
which is coming from the childhood as the gallbladder problem

484
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:51,230
is probably sluggish liver coming on the point he has lived life for so long

485
01:15:51,330 --> 01:15:58,710
and digested a lot of toxins and he is not still on a diseased liver or a diseased gallbladder.

486
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:03,220
– No, it’s not complete. What I should look for?

487
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:07,740
– I don’t know. That’s why I’m here. I should learn from you.

488
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:17,340
–I did not understand your question you see that’s why I said what I should look.

489
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,720
I will give you an answer.

490
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:37,970
I do never imagine or project things, I take the facts and I base always the prescription on facts.

491
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:45,870
Because you can project in any patient anything you like, actually.

492
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:56,420
He’s this, he’s that, he has been this, he has been that but his actual symptoms

493
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:03,380
are pointing to certain remedies. You have to go by this.

494
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:16,730
When the time will come when the traumataic experience from childhood will come up

495
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:32,910
that means his subconscious whatever has kept inside has been freed to react

496
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:43,470
you will see another picture altogether which that picture may be ign picture, staph picture,

497
01:17:45,070 --> 01:17:48,410
nat-m whatever.

498
01:17:48,910 --> 01:17:58,720
So this traumatic experience in childhood will be nullified

499
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:08,750
but it the right time with the right remedy and with the right symptoms. You cannot force it.

500
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,390
- Are the ticks still present at the moment?

501
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:32,770
I seem to remember from the interview that you said “you try to hide them successfully”

502
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:39,960
but there are still there? Still now? The ticks, all this central nervous disturbance?

503
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,960
– Are still yes.

504
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:48,950
– So my question will be why don’t we put this as well strong in the…

505
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:55,150
- It’s not the time for the ticks. The ticks belong to earlier

506
01:18:55,250 --> 01:19:00,450
even beyond the problem of the gallbladder.

507
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:09,360
If we fix this then the reason of having the ticks may appear.

508
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:23,920
I am not sure we can actually eliminate that level so deep. I am not sure but we will try. But not now.

509
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:29,800
Ok, good night.

510
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:51,990
What I wanted to make clear is that with the example of the case we saw yesterday,

511
01:19:52,090 --> 01:20:09,760
the follow-up; what we have seen; we prescribed first bac, aggravation, no amelioration.

512
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:20,350
Second remedy lyc, aggravation, no amelioration.

513
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:34,160
Third remedy… he’s aggravated and he sends me a report and in the report

514
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:46,090
I realize there are some changes which are interesting and then I said ok,

515
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:51,830
I see he is very sensitive and he is in a very precarious state,

516
01:20:51,930 --> 01:21:04,980
I say very careful take arg-n 9CH once a day or three times a day I can’t remember

517
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:20,590
and with one dose he takes there is a big aggravation and brings out a syndrome

518
01:21:20,690 --> 01:21:26,850
that was there 10 years ago suppressed by antibiotics.

519
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:46,750
We know that when an old state of health comes back that was suppressed

520
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:52,680
that is the best thing can happen to your patient.

521
01:21:54,850 --> 01:22:01,670
That means the organism goes back 10 years ago

522
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:12,100
and finds itself in the same immunological state in which he was 10 years ago.

523
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:21,430
But due to antibiotics and to the suppression his whole health was really damaged.

524
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:31,160
After the suppression 10 years ago he starts taking homeopathic remedy.

525
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:36,050
After a while he starts with neuropathy.

526
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:44,080
What is due to the suppression by the antibiotics

527
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:52,100
and how much the wrong homeopathic treatment has helped?

528
01:22:55,610 --> 01:23:02,990
Comes here to me after 10 years of 20-30 remedies maybe 100 remedies

529
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:15,850
usually they don’t say all the remedies and he comes and says “Help me. Solve the case."

530
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:24,600
Is it possible to find a remedy straightaway that will cure the whole case?

531
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:35,700
Wait I want to make you aware because it’s very important to understand this

532
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:40,210
and you can appreciate what to do.

533
01:23:44,370 --> 01:24:00,440
So what you know after the reaction of the remedy that this remedy arg-n has done a lot good for him

534
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:10,440
but now he is in an even worse state than before. Because he has a high fever, he’s destroyed,

535
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:20,300
he feels that he cannot eat, he cannot sleep the whole night, he’s painful etc.

536
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:29,350
He sent me the case and now I remember I sent him a wrong remedy

537
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:39,200
which we did not mention yesterday Hep, no? Lach.

538
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:59,860
Becomes even worse and then I spoke with him and realize that the remedy is nit-ac.

539
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:10,260
He takes now the nit-ac which is the treatment for the acute that has developed.

540
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:18,770
So on the chronic condition it was arg-n which helped.

541
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:31,770
Developed an acute which has to be treated homeopathically now. I was arguing with him.

542
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:39,800
He said “I don’t know if it is…whether it is just tonsillitis…”

543
01:25:53,480 --> 01:26:05,560
He gets the nit-ac and within 3-5 hours the pain starts reducing,

544
01:26:05,660 --> 01:26:14,610
the fever goes down and the next he’s much better and a few days later much better.

545
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:37,420
Now what we have done, we have treated, we have brought back the organism to the age 23.

546
01:26:45,610 --> 01:26:54,090
He has some numbness still.

547
01:26:55,850 --> 01:27:07,650
And he has ticks which have started long time ago when he was a child since 6 years old

548
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:14,930
when he was receiving all these stresses because of the mother and father conflict.

549
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:28,590
Actually the problem that we have here is whether in order to help him further

550
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:38,520
to reach the level of health at 6 years old when he developed the ticks

551
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:49,150
because his organism could not tolerate the grief looking at his parents.

552
01:27:49,250 --> 01:28:03,080
Before do we need to repeat arg-n for instance? Do we have enough symptoms at this moment,

553
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:09,420
2 months after nit-ac, do we have a clear picture?

554
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:29,320
Or do we have in order to progress with the case to repeat nit-ac or to give another remedy

555
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:33,480
that will complete the action of nit-ac

556
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:45,150
and then let the organism progress with the symptomatology of the ticks

557
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:48,020
and the nervous condition?

558
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:57,420
In order to have a new picture that we can treat which can go deeper.

559
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:11,220
So with homeopathy this is something which amazes me, always.

560
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:22,420
The laws and order that there is in the organism if you stimulate properly the organism.

561
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:34,750
There is an order that we know with information we have that this order should be like this

562
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:43,320
and if you know that then only you can tackle such cases.

563
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:56,310
If you don’t know the theory quite in depth forget evaluating what has happened to your patient.

564
01:29:56,410 --> 01:30:07,820
You will give one remedy, then another… no real, deep changes in the organism.

565
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:26,260
On this occasion I will remind you of the case of the Turk. Now see the order in his organism.

566
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:32,640
He is a healthy person but with hereditary weakness he gets stress.

567
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:36,890
Then his stomach starts paining.

568
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:47,850
What kind of pain? Looks like gastritis, too much acidity and therefore some burning.

569
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:58,760
But why is not a simple gastritis and when they examined him they find 8 little ulcers?

570
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:14,270
I call it that is a Barrett syndrome according to my understanding.

571
01:31:14,370 --> 01:31:20,510
Much more serious condition than just a simple gastritis.

572
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:28,560
He wants to get some relief and he gets some blockers

573
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:44,840
and you don’t allow the stomach to release and the organism needs another release.

574
01:31:45,320 --> 01:31:57,160
And then he starts discharge from the nose and then you choose a remedy

575
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:00,650
that stops the discharge from the nose

576
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:08,160
and you think that the discharge from the nose has stopped, I have done a good job.

577
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:10,300
You’ve done a bad job.

578
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:20,990
You just gave a local remedy that stopped the detonation of the organism.

579
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:31,220
And then it keeps on giving anti-acids, treat it 3-5 years anti-acids, the organism is pressurized

580
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:46,650
and has to find another outlet. And most probably starts with the hernia and then the neurinoma.

581
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:55,630
You prescribe a remedy, what you should expect?

582
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:04,710
The normal thing that you should expect is that one of the first things

583
01:33:04,810 --> 01:33:10,490
that will be released is the last that has appeared.

584
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:19,190
So he will start sleeping much better and his back… Not the stomach immediately.

585
01:33:19,290 --> 01:33:31,120
The stomach it’s deep, it’s an ulcer. Is a problem which is much deeper but the hernia

586
01:33:31,220 --> 01:33:44,140
which I believe is small still is touching the nerve but a little bit just…

587
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:58,670
The remedy will act will take back the hernia by 1mm or less and there is going to be a release.

588
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:09,630
Eventually the cure should go.

589
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:18,780
When he will say “I had an aggravation” the aggravation may not be here,

590
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:26,610
may be in the stomach from your remedy so by the time he has an aggravation in the stomach

591
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:38,160
this will be released because now the stomach is free to let out what the organism needs to let out.

592
01:34:50,550 --> 01:34:58,610
I wanted to make clear of what is going on with these examples.

593
01:34:58,710 --> 01:35:01,490
When you prescribe an homeopathic remedy.

594
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:16,040
The idea is when you give a remedy and you have an aggravation, you say stop the aggravation.

595
01:35:17,070 --> 01:35:30,530
Just observe what is manifesting the organism now as a new picture and prescribe accordingly.

596
01:35:30,630 --> 01:35:33,040
And if you do that and of course you know Materia Medica

597
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:40,030
and of course I am helped with the computer.

598
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:53,450
Nobody believes that I have everything in my mind. You believe it I can see it. It’s wrong.

599
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:57,130
It is not possible.

600
01:35:58,890 --> 01:36:04,360
You have to look on the repertory, I have to look in the Materia Medica all the time to confirm

601
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:10,200
that I am not making a mistake. Of course I am wrote Crotalus cascavella

602
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:17,960
because I knew the picture and the picture was this woman, it was very characteristic,

603
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:27,860
I had seen it before and I had perceived it but then I wanted to see the repertorization

604
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:33,230
and I said “My god” cascavella was coming second remedy.

605
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:37,730
Now I feel more calm, more secure.

606
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:46,730
About arg-n.

607
01:36:54,880 --> 01:37:01,940
- Although he was in a lower level of health you prescribed a high potency. Can you tell us why?

608
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:05,040
- I did not really. I gave 200CH really.

609
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:13,610
- I’d like to ask a question related to the case.

610
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:24,430
Let’s say we reach a point where we are back to age 6 and we get rid of the ticks

611
01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:28,790
which developed when he was 6.

612
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:52,600
And in 2 years time for some reasons he takes antibiotics because the doctor prescribed

613
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:58,520
or he takes antibiotics…
- The ticks will be back.

614
01:38:01,630 --> 01:38:06,780
If we had not reached that state

615
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:15,430
and if he takes now antibiotics the damage is not going to be very big

616
01:38:15,530 --> 01:38:26,440
but definitely he is going to bring more depression, more anxiety, bring it down all his immune system.

617
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:33,040
Not only with antibiotics. With the wrong medicines.

618
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:37,290
I want to give you an example.

619
01:38:38,030 --> 01:38:53,630
I was treating for 4 years a very rich American man who was told that he should go to dialysis

620
01:38:53,730 --> 01:39:01,040
because of his creatinine, it was high, his kidneys were breaking down.

621
01:39:02,030 --> 01:39:07,940
Anemia was very severe, the K was very high, it was a bad state.

622
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:14,280
I started treating and I treated him for 4 years.

623
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:22,700
I went to America, because of him I went 2 time, just to see him physically.

624
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:25,190
I treated him for 4 years.

625
01:39:25,290 --> 01:39:34,940
Creatinine went down not completely gone, anemia was better, he was better…

626
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:43,190
Through telephoning me for 4 years almost once a day. Once a day he would give me a report.

627
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:53,770
I had enough. He felt secure. “I had a pimple here”. I said “Ok, forget it”.

628
01:39:53,870 --> 01:40:00,500
But he would keep me for almost half an hour every time. It was unbelievable.

629
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:14,120
I said to my secretary “Write him a letter and tell him, for every call he would have to pay 500$”.

630
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:30,290
I never heard from him anymore. He did not telephone. I said thank God.

631
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:37,610
He thought because he knew exactly when he was telling me these symptoms

632
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:40,620
the remedy I prescribed was that.

633
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:54,250
He thought “now I know myself what I have to take”. I knew what was going to happen but I said ok.

634
01:40:54,350 --> 01:41:10,700
After 6 months I received a call. “I’m in a terrible state. I have this, I have that.

635
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:23,540
My creatinine level has risen, my anemia is worse. Please save me. Money is not an issue.”

636
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:31,510
Now money was not an issue. I said “Now the issue is me.

637
01:41:31,610 --> 01:41:36,690
In your place I’ve taken up another patient.

638
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:45,570
I cannot continue. So you go to another homepaths.

639
01:41:45,670 --> 01:41:50,560
There are some homeopaths in New York.”

640
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:57,920
And in another 3 months he was in dialysis.

641
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:08,000
For 4 years you have been told to be immediately in the dialysis, for 4 years I was keeping him

642
01:42:08,100 --> 01:42:15,240
and they thought by taking all kinds of remedies… the whole thing came back…

643
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:21,740
he did not take any antibiotics, just took a lot homeopathic remedies,

644
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:27,840
wrong remedies at the wrong time and the whole thing collapsed.

645
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:44,340
What I tell you is not a theory, it’s really an experience which I have for the last 52 years.

646
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:55,970
- Can I say something? Let’s say he ruins and then start treating him again.

647
01:42:56,070 --> 01:43:00,250
Will he develop the tonsillitis that he had?

648
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:10,910
-No. Tonsillitis is cured now. It won’t come back…

649
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:17,660
Not that he may not get an acute but the kind of tonsillitis…

650
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:28,490
this was not a tonsillitis this was an abscess in the tonsils, so severe.

651
01:43:28,590 --> 01:43:38,670
Maybe infectious mononucleosis is a quite serious condition.

652
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:48,030
People may also leave this world and go for the next world if it is not treated properly.

653
01:43:48,130 --> 01:43:52,070
So it’s a serious condition. This condition, it will not come.

654
01:43:52,170 --> 01:43:57,660
Because he has been treated now homeopathically and the organism got rid of that.

655
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,680
It will not suppress this time.

656
01:44:00,780 --> 01:44:02,260
- Antibiotics will not suppress him?

657
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:11,660
-No antibiotics will not unless he has an acute, he has an influenza and he takes antibiotics

658
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:14,660
because of the influenza.

659
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:22,500
His organism will go down but will never come back again with mononucleosis.

660
01:44:22,990 --> 01:44:25,730
-The main complaint belongs to the nervous system

661
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:29,480
but you said right now we treat a problem of the gallbladder

662
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:35,150
which prevents him from absorbing certain elements which support the nervous system.

663
01:44:35,250 --> 01:44:41,320
- Yes it appears. But I told him to wait 6 moths. Because in 6 months, if you wait,

664
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:44,560
you may have a totally different picture

665
01:44:45,910 --> 01:44:55,330
unless there is a crisis with the gallbladder he can use the chel.

666
01:44:55,430 --> 01:45:01,280
Otherwise he has to wait for at least 6 months.

667
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:08,900
You will be surprised by the differences you will see in 6 months because of nit-ac.

668
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:20,790
-My question was if in this case you will agree to recommend him taking some supplements

669
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:25,970
for the nervous system or if this will interfere with the case…

670
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:30,050
- I don’t do it. I’ll tell you the reason.

671
01:45:30,150 --> 01:45:35,200
Because if I had given a supplement and then he comes back and gives me some symptoms

672
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:40,450
I don’t know if these symptoms are real or because of the supplement.

673
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:46,210
That means the picture is disturbed due to the supplements.

674
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:49,950
So when I’m treating Idon’t want to give supplements.

675
01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:55,650
Later on if the treatment is quite ok, he wants to take some supplements

676
01:45:55,750 --> 01:46:02,730
there is no problem but a sensitive organism if you give supplements will change the picture.

677
01:46:03,310 --> 01:46:08,710
-In this case he understands the process but with somebody who does not understand

678
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:13,390
and is very worried about this I will have the tendency to give something.

679
01:46:13,490 --> 01:46:15,810
-Bad luck.

680
01:46:18,250 --> 01:46:27,200
The American man just because he was stingy he had bad luck.

681
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:31,710
He was terrified with the idea of going to the dialysis.

682
01:46:31,810 --> 01:46:40,790
When I first met him, he said “I am going to the dialysis”, he was paralyzed with fear

683
01:46:40,890 --> 01:46:47,800
and he ended up because he thought “No, I don’t need George”.
