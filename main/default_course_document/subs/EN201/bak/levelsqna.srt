1
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:27,710
So in this session you have the opportunity to ask any question you like. Anything.

2
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:37,380
So I would like to hear your first… What would you like to know? You can ask anything,

3
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:54,180
if I’m married or not married… Ok take this and the other also and yes…

4
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:05,720
You distribute it to the people. 2 to 3 questions only. Just remember this.

5
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,980
- Only 3.

6
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,170
- Because later on you will remember “I have another one”.

7
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,440
- Ok. Great.

8
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:18,610
- Be careful. So first. Just one, then we will go around and then you have again.

9
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,120
- Sure.

10
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,200
- Ask the most important.

11
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:34,520
- As in the case of nat-m which you have given 50M.

12
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,010
He has muscle pains and joint pains.

13
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:45,540
In our country one of the very important common reasons is B12 deficiency.

14
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,020
So my question is; you said that we cannot allow supplement

15
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,770
because it changes the symptom picture, remedy picture.

16
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,600
- Yes.

17
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,780
- So in our country almost 60% of the people are vegetarian and nutritionally deficient.

18
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,350
As you said we really have a lot of poverty in our country.

19
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:21,430
What should be done? Either giving a remedy and nutrition supplementation

20
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:28,930
or what should be done to avoid that because just to give vitamin B solves the problem.

21
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,440
But again we’ll have B12 deficiency. So we need to prescribe.

22
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,970
But what should be done in order to do all these things?

23
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:50,870
- There are 2 things. One is to give supplements and the other is to give the homeopathic remedy.

24
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,370
Together it’s not good to do it at the same time.

25
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:06,030
So what you do is; you take the case, prescribe the remedy, see that your remedy was correct.

26
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:11,510
That means there was an initial aggravation, then an amelioration.

27
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:22,270
And then the person stays more or less well but still he feels tired.

28
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:30,010
Then you can think of supplement. But first you have to see the reaction of your remedy.

29
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:39,520
Otherwise you will not be able to know “Did I give the correct remedy? Or I gave the wrong remedy?”

30
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:47,470
So therefore you can do supplements but afterwards and after you have seen

31
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,680
what your remedy can do.

32
00:03:51,780 --> 00:04:00,270
What happens many times is that the correct remedy will make the organism

33
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:08,680
absorb the microelements and vitamins that needs much easier.

34
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,040
And that’s why it’s rejuvenated the organism.

35
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:27,170
So, if you don’t know what to do in a case, you’d better choose the supplements,

36
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,180
give all the supplements.

37
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,270
And if supplements do something and strengthen the organism

38
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,760
then maybe we’ll have a better picture.

39
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:48,030
But if you do it together you will never know what you have done. This is the right thing.

40
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,860
Of course the right thing is done very few times in life.

41
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,770
But I have to tell you what the right thing is. Ok?

42
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,930
So if you can do it or you cannot do it it’s up to you. You choose.

43
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:24,390
But I have seen that people who are deficient of a particular… of calcium or phosphorus

44
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:32,000
or calcarea phosphorica, you can see in the laboratory examinations their deficiencies.

45
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:44,260
You give the right remedy and the deficiencies start balancing without supplements.

46
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,520
But now, if you don’t find the remedy what will you do? You’ll give supplements.

47
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,870
You’ll also give the remedy, you’ll do it together but... I’ll tell you the secret.

48
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:07,270
The secret is; insist in trying to find the correct remedy. You give wrong remedy.

49
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:17,360
Ok. You observe. The organism will give you a response to your wrong remedy.

50
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:26,040
But if you wait long enough the response will go towards the right direction.

51
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:32,010
Take for instance the case to which I prescribed bac in the beginning.

52
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:38,070
He was crying “I’m aggravated!” No, you were not crying.

53
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,290
He says “Your remedy did nothing. It just aggravated me”

54
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:52,020
He just wrote it in a very polite way.

55
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,450
“Your remedy just aggravated me. Done nothing.”

56
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,600
Now you know you have given a remedy which is close.

57
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,100
That means it has aggravated, it has touched him.

58
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,330
And now what is the new picture? This is the new picture.

59
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:27,610
And then the next remedy I gave him was lyc. And “Dear George, your remedy it’s…

60
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:33,110
I’m worse actually. Thank you.”

61
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:44,860
But in the meantime he has described what was going on in his organism.

62
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:58,110
I knew he is very sensitive and then I perceive within his symptoms the idea of arg-n.

63
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:04,060
And I say ok, take a few doses, low potency.

64
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:13,500
He takes one dose of arg-n and then he writes “It’s a catastrophe!”

65
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:25,200
he says “I got worse and now on top of it I have tonsillitis with high fever and what shall I do?”

66
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:38,430
And then I’m anxious and I say what can I do? Hep, I think. No? Lach.

67
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:54,790
My mind stuck in hep. Take lach. “I’m terrible. I have pain, I have fever, I’m exhausted,

68
00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:01,250
I can hardly work. I stopped working. I’m lying in bed, I cannot do anything etc.”

69
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,940
I should have said ok, take antibiotics”.

70
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:21,260
But I know if I tell him “Take antibiotics” his organism is finished, destroyed.

71
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:29,170
So I battled that certain moment. I have never telephoned a patient in my life.

72
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:35,590
So I call him because he was “I’m dying!” I thought “Oh! My God!”

73
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:42,340
You see if you know some pathology; there is a tonsillitis

74
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:49,140
which is called “Ludwig tonsillitis” [Ludwig angina] Do you know this? No.

75
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,880
This is a tonsillitis that leads you to death. You can die.

76
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:59,730
Many people have died from this kind of tonsillitis.

77
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:14,550
Tonsillitis but so severe that nothing can stop it. So if you know what is going on

78
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,060
and I knew that…

79
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:24,060
And I don’t know what’s going on because I can’t remember now, he had a mononucleosis?

80
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,790
I can’t remember. And then I think again and I say “Check it out.

81
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:38,390
Tell me if this is mononucleosis.” He says “I cannot get up and go to check it.”

82
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:49,870
I said “Ok, take nit-ac.” He takes nit-ac, he says “Within a few hours the fever dropped

83
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:56,540
and then I started recovering” and 2 days later he goes to have the checkup.

84
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:08,290
It’s very late now. The laboratory tests will be changed totally after 2-3 days.

85
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:22,050
So, what I could do? This is one example which you have in front of you that’s why I mentioned it.

86
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:29,550
You can imagine I have been through hundreds and hundreds and thousands of such cases in my life.

87
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:40,050
And I had to face the situation. Sometimes here in the class there were people with heart attacks.

88
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:44,300
I had to face the situation. What can I do?

89
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:54,040
In America when I was teaching in Esalen, in that weird place. Do you know Esalen in California?

90
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,790
Who know Esalen in California? Only one knows Esalen.

91
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:10,070
It’s the worst, the most weird w-e-i-r-d… I don’t know he is an English person,

92
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,210
he can tell me how to pronounce it.

93
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:23,550
Hundred people have come from all over the world and we had intense teaching.

94
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:34,030
We started 8 o’clock until 6 o’clock in the evening and people were under big stress.

95
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:43,290
So, one student got a brain stroke, he was going like this.

96
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:55,390
The class got very excited “What will we do?” I said “Out! Everybody!”

97
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:02,780
Otherwise the noise cannot allow you to see and to think properly.

98
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,200
And there was one that was pulling out Bach remedies that remedy and I said “Wait”

99
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:24,940
So I observed and I saw a few signs of gels I said “Give me a dose of gels 200CH” I put gels 200CH.

100
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:36,540
I waited for half an hour. He started coming back and I said to the class “Ok, come now.”

101
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:43,550
He stayed in the class and continued the lectures.

102
00:13:48,140 --> 00:14:01,040
The energy was so great. Once you lose your mind you cannot think.

103
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:12,810
But again I’m talking about… this was 32 years ago.

104
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:23,380
I had quite a lot of experience by that time but not as much as I have now of course.

105
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:37,970
And I was lucky I think. And helped by the higher forces… whatever.

106
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,790
That all this never happened an accident.

107
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,650
But the main thing is, first of all I have studied very much.

108
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:57,890
The second is that I never compromised.

109
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:07,290
Sometimes I speak Greek in order to find the Greek word while the English word is this.

110
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,620
I remember the Greek word. I never compromise.

111
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:19,030
If I don’t know what to do; maybe it’s acon, maybe it’s lach, maybe it’s gels,

112
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:27,870
maybe ars, bring all of them. Give it to them. One of them will act. You hope.

113
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:34,200
It may act but it may not. And then I confuse the case.

114
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:42,540
Once the case is confused try to find the remedy… Especially in such severe situation.

115
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:54,200
The way you learn, the best way is to see a real case. To see a case of crotalus cascavella.

116
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,790
Then you’ll never forget it.

117
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:08,440
I was lucky because I was able to see these pictures again and again

118
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,050
because I did not mix the remedies.

119
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,530
If every time I have given 2 remedies, never mind 3 or 4. 2.

120
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:25,050
How could I know this picture belongs to this and not to that remedy? Finish.

121
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:37,380
All the information is gone. So, next question.

122
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:44,720
- Can I ask a question?
- Who is speaking?

123
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:52,460
- Brigitte. There is a lot of information in the literature about remedies

124
00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:02,440
and it’s so outstanding but how you suggest we would take onboard new information?

125
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,260
I mean there are for example provings happening all the time around the world,

126
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:15,860
new information accumulating. How you suggest we use this information?

127
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:26,370
- I’ll tell you something about the new proving. First I must tell you that

128
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:37,200
when I started homeopathy it was 1960. I came back to Greece in ’67.

129
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:45,250
During all these 7 seven years I was in different schools trying to learn

130
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:49,010
but I was studying very much.

131
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,840
There were no new provings.

132
00:17:52,940 --> 00:18:01,230
There was Kent’s Repertory when I returned to Greece and I started treating people.

133
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,650
Using the Kent’s Repertory, Kent’s Materia Medica and Boericke Materia Medica

134
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:17,320
and Materia Medica Pura and few other books. The success I had was unbelievable.

135
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,310
It was created a whole movement in a few years.

136
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:27,820
Medical doctors started coming to learn saying “What is this?”

137
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:34,490
In no time I had a center with several medical doctors who were working with me.

138
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:40,490
Only with this information. I did not need any new provings.

139
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:46,500
Do we need new provings? The answer is yes.

140
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:54,760
But with one condition; as long as this proving has been done properly.

141
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:19,820
What do I mean? In order to create symptoms on a prover you have to give in quantity enough

142
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:36,670
as to create a kind of a poisoning of the prover. You have to give enough material doses.

143
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:52,020
And if I give to the whole class… I have a remedy and I give in material doses to every one of you.

144
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:59,280
Every day you take 5mg of this substance.

145
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:07,290
Eventually the most sensitive of you to this substance will come and give me some symptoms.

146
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,770
You will say “I woke up with headache.”

147
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:16,850
Another one says “I had also headache” 2 or 3 coming first up

148
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:23,440
because they are the most sensitive to this substance. Then you continue the proving

149
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:35,530
and after a month or a certain period you stop the experiment and then you collect the symptoms.

150
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:44,690
But then the symptoms are real symptoms, not imaginary symptoms.

151
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,690
Then you continue the experiment in this way.

152
00:20:49,790 --> 00:21:02,790
Who was the most sensitive of the group who developed first the symptoms? 3,4 out of 100.

153
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:12,180
You take these 4 and then you give a high potency in order to see what a high potency

154
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:18,790
in a sensitive person to that drug can do. And then you record it.

155
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:33,790
And then you collect this information which cannot be more than a few hundred symptoms the most.

156
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,040
Not thousands.

157
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:48,600
And then you apply this; if you have seen that in most of the provers

158
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,350
there was pain developing on the right hypochondria.

159
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:00,020
That means it affected the gallbladder in its function.

160
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:06,340
So, when you have a problem with the gallbladder and other remedies

161
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:18,890
do not fit you may now try this new remedy. What has happened really is a different story.

162
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:26,250
With people who supposed to prove new remedies.

163
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:36,100
There are some who say “You don’t have to do a proving.” What to do?

164
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:44,500
“Just imagine it. Imagine what this remedy can do.”

165
00:22:44,600 --> 00:23:00,260
I say “Oh! My God! If I give you and I say “Tell me what the remedy pall will do. Imagine.”

166
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:13,940
Each one will think pall is a kind of precious metal and so the men must feel very precious…

167
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,100
Nonsense.

168
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:24,500
So this kind of proving… If somebody tells me here are the provings,

169
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:34,090
out of imagination of course I say “This is rubbish and disgrace for science.”

170
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,680
Totally out.

171
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:55,030
We come to more serious people where they give one dose of 30CH to 10-15 people

172
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:14,360
and then collect symptoms of that dose and create a book. And the book is called… this remedy.

173
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,680
It’s a whole book with thousands of symptoms.

174
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:34,240
I say “Wait a moment.” I give many times a wrong remedy and if it is a wrong potency

175
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:43,240
the patient comes back and tells me “I’m the same” and I try to find something and I find nothing.

176
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:53,840
In your proving you gave 1 dose and you created 30.000 symptoms.

177
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:01,480
So I investigate. I said “I want to know how this happens” And I found a girl,

178
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:09,240
a doctor actually who was in the group. She says “I will tell you how this happens.

179
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,890
Because we are in a group in a hotel.

180
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:20,190
We take the remedy and when we come out of the hotel and we start discussing.

181
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:25,490
“How are you?
– I think I have a pain on the right.

182
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:30,320
– Oh!
- I think also.

183
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:35,100
–What about dizziness?
– Oh, yes!”

184
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:49,990
And one between another they exchange ideas of what is happening with the remedy they took.

185
00:25:50,090 --> 00:26:03,850
In the end of course there is a lot of stories of what happened with 1 dose of hydrogen 30CH.

186
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:18,490
I still want to investigate because I don’t believe anything from the beginning,

187
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:25,320
never mind what you tell me. But I will listen and I will investigate.

188
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:34,430
So an Italian group comes and they say “We want to make a proving.

189
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:42,410
We are a group of Italian medical doctors. Would you be the head of the…

190
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:50,650
Give us a remedy?” I said yes. I asked these men with the hydrogen.

191
00:26:50,750 --> 00:27:02,920
“Can you give me the hydrogen 30CH; I need it for my use.”

192
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:09,760
So without telling them anything I said “This is the remedy. You try”

193
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:14,000
they tried the experiment every day they took this

194
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:24,270
and after a month they came to the conclusion nothing has happened. Nobody has really anything.

195
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:37,640
“What was the remedy you gave us?” They demanded they said “You must tell us”

196
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:50,340
I said “Hydrogen” They said “What? Hydrogen is not free. How can you give hydrogen?

197
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,310
How can you catch hydrogen? The moment it comes with… it becomes water.

198
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:01,970
What are you talking” I said “Wait, calm down. Here is the book.

199
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:10,740
You see these people they claim that by taking hydrogen 30CH they have created a new proving”

200
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:24,680
So there was a big argument and I completely lost credit with this group of Italian doctors.

201
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:33,800
They said George is really crazy to give us hydrogen for proving. We lost our time,

202
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:46,140
we lost our energy. The proving was funded by somebody and lost his money because of that.

203
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:53,640
But I investigated it. And I found out that the provings as they are done,

204
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,240
they are not reliable.

205
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:02,490
Unfortunately. Because they are not properly done.

206
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:10,980
And if you don’t do a proper proving… Ok hydrogen may have no symptoms, we can forget.

207
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:20,730
But a lot of other poisons and thing like that they will have definitely symptoms.

208
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,920
So they say “George, you don’t like us to do provings”

209
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,090
Of course I like you to do provings but do it properly.

210
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:35,160
Don’t tell me that you give 1 dose of 30CH and you collect 3.000 symptoms.

211
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:44,300
Do it properly. You want to give a poison? Give a poison, give it in a very small quantity.

212
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:56,580
Eventually you will create some real proving. So the way that modern… I don’t believe.

213
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:04,150
I have criticized that and maybe eventually some people will do it properly.

214
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:09,060
I am sure we will have some reliable provings

215
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:21,400
but up to now I don’t know very many reliable provings that you can use.

216
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,310
And after all you don’t need them.

217
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:42,210
My success which I had the Kent’s Repertory it was so great that created a whole movement

218
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:49,130
and imposed homeopathy upon the medical profession.

219
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:57,050
Medical people are sending their family, themselves,

220
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:01,140
their patients to homeopathy, to my students.

221
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:12,650
Greece is a very conservative country. It’s not like England, everyone does whatever he likes.

222
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:17,370
You don’t have to be a medical doctor you can practice.

223
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,290
Holland you can practice, never mind.

224
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:29,560
In Greece you have to be a medical doctor before you give a prescription. It’s very strict.

225
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:39,800
And yet there was a university. They gave me the degree of professor of this university.

226
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:47,370
Unbelievable because professors of university given an honorary degree

227
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:51,930
were another 2 persons in the whole history of Greece.

228
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:58,090
And they gave it to me and everybody shut up. Nobody spoke.

229
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:06,530
Why? Because of respect they have for homeopathy. This great respect.

230
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:17,030
Where this respect comes from? Because of the result, nothing else. So new provings.

231
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:21,350
Absolutely as long as they done properly.

232
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:33,590
The problem with homeopathy is that as you understand we are dealing with energy.

233
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:44,350
We have entered a state of medicine which is not anymore the material medicine.

234
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:53,930
It is an energy medicine. Therefore it’s something immaterial that cannot be seen.

235
00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:00,840
So, nobody can check out what we are doing.

236
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:05,090
Because of this all kinds of imaginations

237
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:12,840
and all kinds of phantasies have inserted into homeopathy,

238
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:25,670
pretending that “Now I have found another way” How is such people still survive

239
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:36,350
and they can hold a kind of clientele, of patient?  Because of the placebo effect.

240
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:42,350
There is what we call a placebo effect.

241
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:49,650
So, if you tell the patient “Come, I’ll cure you” and create a situation

242
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:58,000
and then you give him something with the belief that something is happening, he feels better.

243
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:06,090
And that keeps the patients with such people who give wrong remedies.

244
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:14,350
Sometimes these people they give a right remedy as well so there is a real cure as well.

245
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:36,280
… Sankaran… and all these people they found new ideas.

246
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:41,900
You look like an animal you have to get animal remedies.

247
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:50,670
One time I had the German group and it was a follow up of a German with asthma.

248
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:59,000
And I presented this to the class, the man.

249
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:05,360
I presented the case with black man with mustaches.

250
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:13,110
I said to the class “Tell me he needs; a vegetable remedy?

251
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:24,470
An animal remedy? Or a mineral remedy?” The whole class “Animal”.

252
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:38,130
I said “Let’s see his follow up.” I went inside I asked … “Very well, my asthma is gone.

253
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:48,650
One year it had gone after…” I came back to the class “What was the remedy?” Belladonna.

254
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:59,040
Which means in Italian “beautiful woman” actually. He needed bell.

255
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:06,350
Why should you search for an animal remedy to give him? For God’s sake.

256
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:25,540
After an hour of investigation she said “I took my husband to one of those people.

257
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:38,290
Finally he asked my husband “Which is the bird he likes?” among the different questions.

258
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:55,740
So my husband said “Owl” he wrote owl 10M.

259
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:06,290
After an hour and a half of investigation he asks what is the bird you like

260
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:14,300
and he prescribes the bird. He is beyond my comprehension.

261
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:21,640
She was a medical doctor who took her husband to him to be treated for something quite serious.

262
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:32,360
All these kind of thing have given a very bad name to homeopathy

263
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:43,200
and also an attack on homeopathy has started based on such nonsense.

264
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:52,720
And it’s going to grow and these people are giving ammunition . They don’t attack me.

265
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,360
Nobody will attack me because they know they will get the answer.

266
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,550
But if you say such nonsense…

267
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:17,960
Another one says he found the cure for AIDS. What is the cure for AIDS?

268
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:24,360
He says “Here in that disc. What do you do?

269
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:38,040
You put that disc on your dvd-player and you listen to it day and night for a month.

270
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:46,990
And if you listen to this day and night you are cured in the end of the month.”

271
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:57,210
For God’s sake. If you do such things and you call it homeopathy, classical homeopathy…

272
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:06,960
What can you do. Wait India, you are impatient.

273
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:21,100
- This discussion about meditation actually it came in the same direction I wanted to ask

274
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:36,860
because I practice in the middle of a community of Yogi meditators, religious, new age people.

275
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,100
I practice in Thailand and Thailand has a very big tradition of meditation

276
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:50,280
so there are people who come there especially for meditation and they spend months in meditation.

277
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:57,690
And one of my biggest problems actually when I deal with these people

278
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:03,300
is to separate between their beliefs and their real symptoms.

279
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:13,390
My question came in the direction of spiritual practices and influence on our health.

280
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:20,350
A few year ago actually you brought this a little bit up during the complete teachings

281
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:25,080
there was a discussion about conscience, consciousness

282
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:32,620
and mind which went a little bit into that direction but then you got sick and we couldn’t finish.

283
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:42,590
And I left with this question since a long time now about what is your opinion.

284
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,840
What criteria we can use.

285
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,340
- You are asking about the role of consciousness in disease…

286
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:59,370
- How can we distinguish when it comes to such practices between the voice of the conscience

287
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:02,670
and the voice of pathology?

288
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:11,080
- I will tell you something. I have written a paper on this issue.

289
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:17,340
- You gave it to us a few years ago, 3 years ago the complete teaching…

290
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,930
- I wrote a paper and I sent it to the British Medical Journal.

291
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:31,940
They had several departments. I sent it to one of the departments and they rejected it.

292
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:41,760
“Forget it. We cannot publish it”. Then I sent it to Medical Hypothesis another medical journal.

293
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:49,840
They kept it for several months. In the meantime the British Medical Journal they wrote back to me

294
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:57,720
and they said “We think we made a mistake, please submit again your paper”.

295
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:11,450
But I had submitted to Medical Hypothesis. It took 6-9 months before they made a decision

296
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,270
and they rejected it.

297
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:25,810
And then I thought “Ok. I will re-submit it to the British Medical Journal.”

298
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:35,680
And I don’t know for what reason, while they asked me to re-submit it,

299
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:42,580
because it took long time perhaps to re-submit it, they again rejected it.

300
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:49,330
Now I am going to send it to another medical journal

301
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:55,260
because I consider this as a very important issue.

302
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:23,340
The compromise of the idea of conscience, your conscience, once you compromise disease starts.

303
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,440
Disease starts in a very subtle way.

304
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:36,570
That means like something undermining your whole system slowly.

305
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:43,680
And then a stress will come of course. And then the disease will manifest.

306
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:53,670
But has been prepared by these underlying undermining of the conscience

307
00:43:53,770 --> 00:44:07,340
because of some compromise we did at a certain time. This is big problem for humanity.

308
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,090
I consider it the biggest problem that humanity has at this moment

309
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:16,900
and not humanity as a whole.

310
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:27,820
Not everyone, not Indians and not so much the Chinese or not so much the primitive,

311
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:40,930
or not so much the Indians the red Indians or the South Americans.

312
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:53,520
They are coming very fast to the idea of compromising their conscience as well.

313
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:03,670
Compromising for what? For some kind of remuneration.

314
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:13,700
Making money, taking position, power, etc.

315
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:26,980
The moment you made a compromise it is like a natural law that you cannot get out of.

316
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:32,860
You cannot bypass it. It will affect you.

317
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:40,150
And you know I have been treating spiritual people like you

318
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:45,670
who were around Krishnamurti in Switzerland.

319
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:57,640
What have I found out about these people it was that most of them they were sincere seekers

320
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:12,420
but very ill. Very deeply sick. Sick in their minds.

321
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:17,810
They were trying to understand Krishnamurti, what he says.

322
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:24,560
He says “Be aware. Be now. See what is happening at this moment.

323
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,320
Don’t think of the past, don’t think of the future, live the present”

324
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:34,820
and they were trying to get to the state where he was describing,

325
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:42,490
the state that he was living himself but of course all these people

326
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:51,400
who followed him were very rich people. People who were coming from all over the world.

327
00:46:52,170 --> 00:47:02,990
They have done quite a lot in their lives, whatever they have done, compromised a lot

328
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,840
and now finally they live in hell.

329
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:19,090
And hell is the anxiety state or it is the inner state which never gives them peace.

330
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,150
Now they try to find peace finally.

331
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,150
They got the money, they got all the position,

332
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:35,820
they got everything that materially was possible to get but they lost one thing.

333
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:44,490
The joy of life. Very sick. I was treating most of them.

334
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:51,500
Because they knew I was treating Krishnamurti and they were coming to me to be treated of course.

335
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:59,810
And I took their case and I saw their histories and I saw how sad people they were,

336
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:08,250
how they have lost totally the joy of life. They could not.

337
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:23,740
It’s like a very rich person he can have anything. “I want to fly…let’s go to Honolulu.

338
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:29,890
I take my private airplane, we go to Honolulu and there we find something.”

339
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:38,480
They find nothing there in Honolulu. They cannot find anything. Honolulu is within themselves.

340
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:52,830
They carry their unhappiness in Honolulu. But they have compromised their conscience.

341
00:48:55,240 --> 00:49:02,650
- My question is mostly about how to distinguish the sincere ones from the pathology.

342
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:11,310
Because I see people who are obviously gone with clairvoyance…

343
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:15,910
They come to me because they think I am open-minded doctor.

344
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:22,890
I know this is pathology but there are situation where I really don’t know how to take.

345
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:29,650
There is a praying which is sincere or there is a pathology.

346
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:37,640
I have seen you a lot of times taking clairvoyance out, not a pathology.

347
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:41,150
Sometimes you take it as a pathology and sometimes you don’t.

348
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:48,130
- Unfortunately is such that is very deep.

349
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:52,800
Once you have compromised your conscience the pathology

350
00:49:52,900 --> 00:50:02,650
has undermined your very existence as a human being. You do not respect anymore yourself.

351
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:12,510
You know there is an anxiety “I have done wrong.” And that overwhelms you all the time.

352
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:25,430
And that goes very deep. This is what I have found out. You see the nice couple of Turks.

353
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:28,250
No problem. No compromise.

354
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:39,010
“I have done this. It was wrong. I recognize I did something wrong” Can be cured.

355
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:50,230
The people who are not aware of that they try to escape by going to a guru

356
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:56,070
and listening and trying to find out how can I be happy again?

357
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:08,760
That’s a very difficult situation to cure. You cannot get symptoms in such people.

358
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:19,350
Unless there is a purity inside the organism, the organism cannot give out pure symptoms.

359
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:29,940
Gives symptoms which are confused, mixed.  He has a whole list.

360
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:43,160
- In a period of 5 days, in this 5 days course I filled up 236 pages.

361
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:54,650
This is what I wanted to have in my life which I received from you and doctor Erik.

362
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,300
- Thank you.

363
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,800
- We should say thank you to you because we need you.

364
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,650
The purity you have into things it is extraordinary.

365
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:17,800
Practicing homeopathy at this stage I have 3 questions which really bothers me a lot.

366
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,910
I’ll ask one by one.

367
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:27,060
First is when a patient comes to us under some allopathic medication, and he’s on steroid

368
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:36,470
or antibiotics… It will make  a lot of constitutional symptoms masked.

369
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,050
In that respect we should be able to..

370
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:44,900
- You can do nothing. Forget it. Send them back to the conventional doctor.

371
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:52,560
You can do nothing. If people are full of medication you can do nothing actually.

372
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:56,070
Forget it. Another question. One more.

373
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:09,470
- Well I think Sir in modern world more or less they are all getting allopathic medication.

374
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,900
- No that’s not true.

375
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:21,890
- Let me make clear myself. The point is when a patient comes to us to a homeopath.

376
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:27,550
He has gone all around without any solution then they come to a homeopath as a last option.

377
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:32,420
And the say homeopathy is the hope for hopeless. We are not magicians.

378
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:37,560
So this patient is taking allopathic medication…

379
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,300
- Stop the medication, give homeopathic remedy.

380
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:48,300
- How sir? This is the problem. Because we cannot stop antiepileptic drugs, we cannot stop steroids…

381
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:56,800
- What you are asking is a whole lesson of 2-3 hours. Now this is just the last 2-3 minutes.

382
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,400
How can I answer?

383
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,540
- Fine, sir. My second question is….

384
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:10,150
- Oh forget it! You see the reaction?

385
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:21,060
- I would be very happy if you were answering with one sentence.

386
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:27,060
Because I really suffer from it, this is my suffering, you will give me my remedy.

387
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:36,660
Sir actually in levels of health when we see an acute developing after a remedy…

388
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:42,290
In treatment we always are used have aggravation and then amelioration…

389
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:46,030
- Not always. Most of the times but not always.

390
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:51,300
- So the point is we say that is there is aggravation it’s very good

391
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:57,550
but there may be an aggravation or there might be a not perceptible aggravation…

392
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:03,740
- It very good when there is aggravation and then amelioration. Then you have a cure.

393
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:11,290
If you gave only aggravation it means that the remedy was not correct, just aggravated,

394
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:14,290
it was close, it aggravates,

395
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:16,650
then you wait for the next remedy.

396
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,220
- Aggravation does it mean always perceptible aggravation?

397
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,790
Or sometimes the patient cannot understand

398
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:25,790
because in acute vital force is always in such a turmoil.

399
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:29,790
Little aggravation of the problem may not be able to be justified.

400
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:36,140
So we should consider that aggravation means conceivable aggravation or not?

401
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:42,700
- Helen in correct. All these are answered in the e-learning. Take the e-learning.

402
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:55,120
I suggest if you really want to have the information, you have to take the e-learning.
