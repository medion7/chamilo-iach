1
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:15,520
It is a meeting place of the whole world here.

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:26,350
Usually with the idea of coming together and bringing peace to the world.

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:37,000
Because the world is in a terrible state at the moment. And we need peace really.

4
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:44,090
And homeopathy is the most peaceful medicine as you know.

5
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:58,810
So I believe you heard by Eric an overall picture of the levels of health

6
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:17,310
and this was an idea which I conceived back in the 70s and I wrote the first things

7
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:27,740
about this idea in my book “The Science of Homeopathy” that was published in 1978.

8
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:34,560
After that this idea became more and more clear

9
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:43,560
and today I can say that maybe we can answer most of the questions

10
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,740
that a medical person may have.

11
00:01:51,190 --> 00:02:00,420
So I believe that you will be having some questions that we can be discussing.

12
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:10,120
I don’t want to give you some theories. I want to see what is your idea about the levels of health.

13
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,720
How you perceive them , how you understand them

14
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:20,890
and how you think it’s applicable to medicine in general.

15
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,150
So I’d like to hear your questions. And I will try to answer.

16
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,130
-I cannot yet understand how you can have cancer in level 1, for instance.

17
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,380
Because I think it is an immunological disease and if you are in level 1

18
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,140
you have enough health not to have cancer.

19
00:02:49,240 --> 00:03:03,880
- That’s a good question. This levels of health idea, it’s coming from experience,

20
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:18,640
not from a theory which I conceived. How came that this idea that level 1 can have cancer?

21
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:31,960
Back in the 1970s I was giving a class with Greek doctors so one of my students

22
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,640
brought a case he was working in a hospital and he said

23
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:45,470
“This man – 75 years old or something like that.

24
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:52,040
I can’t remember exactly the age but progressed age-  has constant cough.

25
00:03:52,140 --> 00:04:02,060
He’s in our hospital and never mind what we give him the cough continues.

26
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:08,380
So I would like to tell you the case so you can prescribe and maybe I can give him a remedy”.

27
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:25,300
So he read the case and I said “Peter, I am afraid this man has cancer of the lungs”.

28
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,310
He said “why?”. I tell you the story what he told me.

29
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:45,300
This man 70 something living in a kind of village in Greece.

30
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:58,720
Few people there he had an affair with a much younger married woman of the village.

31
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:02,150
They had an affair that was secret.

32
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:13,140
At the certain moment the affair was disclosed and everyone in the village

33
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:21,690
knew that this man had an affair with that married woman.

34
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:36,880
In the analysis of the case I said to him “Peter, did you ask him when this started?”

35
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:47,990
and then he told me that story. He said it started after the revelation of this love affair.

36
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:58,730
Men of the villages, usually healthy people without much history behind

37
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:16,480
and he was not smoking, good organism… So all this made me believe that the shock,

38
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:27,070
there was a shock in the life of this person, so strong that his organism could not overcome it

39
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:34,240
and as an outlet developed this tumor in the lungs.

40
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:48,890
I said this is why I say that this man has cancer. I am talking about 1970-1971.

41
00:06:50,030 --> 00:07:02,140
And homeopathy was new in Greece but still I had a lot of medical people studying under me.

42
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:16,810
So Peter he said “Wait a moment“, he went to another room opened his bag

43
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:23,900
and he pulled out the X-ray and came back with the X-ray now

44
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,330
and said “Yes, that is true. He has cancer.”

45
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:46,070
So the case was a clear Sulphur case and what I realized by that time was

46
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:53,310
that even very healthy person who did not have a lot of drugs before,

47
00:07:53,410 --> 00:08:00,640
who had not damaged his health very deeply, even such a person

48
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:09,230
if he is faced with a strong stress he may develop cancer

49
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:17,030
but the difference will be that in such cases the cancer is curable.

50
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,560
The cancer of the level 1 is curable, why?

51
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:29,820
Because the organism gives a clear picture of the remedy

52
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,430
and the immune system is in good condition and can overcome it.

53
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:44,480
This is the reason why you may have heard especially from India,

54
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:51,180
people of India are of this type,like the villagers,

55
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,730
clean from medication, chemicals, so strong organisms

56
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:06,330
and the Indian homeopaths they have a lot of such cases cured.

57
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:18,040
And once the see 1-5 cases cured they get the idea that homeopathy cures cancer

58
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:29,610
so they start advertising here we cure cancer and people come… It’s not we cure cancer.

59
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:45,460
We cure cancer of the 1st level. Once the cancer develops in levels 7,8,9 forget the cure.

60
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:59,040
Also, you may have heard that there was a spontaneous remission of cancer, like a miracle.

61
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:13,150
Somebody goes to a spiritual person and he prays to his Buddha, God, Christ, whatever

62
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:28,140
and the cancer stops, even cured. Cancer level 1, all these cases.

63
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:44,610
You see, so, what happens is that the stress we can take we can manage with a stress.

64
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:49,650
That means the organism can work out the stress.

65
00:10:49,750 --> 00:11:04,150
You see, because you lost your loved ones, your erotic companion… Ah, big shock.

66
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:12,540
Then what you try to do, you try mentally and emotionally to overcome the issue.

67
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,450
And you try, you think different ways.

68
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:23,110
“He was not worth it”, “He was telling lies”, “He was a liar, he was a terrible person.

69
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:28,290
Forget it. I want to forget him.”, this kind of thinking.

70
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:34,950
And the organism overcomes this through the process finally

71
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:41,160
and you don’t get the effect of the stress.

72
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:48,650
But there are some other organisms that never mind how much how much logic,

73
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:57,900
how much excuses they cannot overcome it.

74
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,230
The moment the organism says “I cannot overcome it” now has to find an outlet.

75
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:20,320
Now, what the outlet can be… The organism has 2 possibilities.

76
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:29,810
That means I cannot overcome it, that means the effect is going to stay in the body.

77
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:45,490
The organism finds which is the weakest point in the organism and the whole stress is directed

78
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:54,400
towards breaking down that organ which is the weakest

79
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:10,250
and then the effect will be from developing a serious chronic disease or even cancer.

80
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,830
That’s one outlet, physical body.

81
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:24,170
The second outlet – you know what it is- mental derangement.

82
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:32,070
They cannot face the facts so they have to find an outlet.

83
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:44,740
So mental derangement, that means the organism leads the mental state in such a condition

84
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,040
so cannot think anymore.

85
00:13:48,750 --> 00:14:04,080
Develops tremendous panic attacks, develops serious mental problems,

86
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:15,990
sometimes goes to schizophrenia, goes to total confusion of the mind so the organism,

87
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:31,080
has not the possibility anymore to face the stress because is an another state altogether.

88
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:48,510
Not in his logical mind. Now, see how this is connected with the suicides

89
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:58,120
which take place after love disappointment, after any shock.

90
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:06,440
The moment the person cannot face the problems goes and jumps.

91
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:14,610
The moment that jumps that this the moment of madness, of total craziness.

92
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:22,440
The moment has reached the point of self-destruction

93
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:33,690
and the idea is if you want to think a little bit deeper, the idea is always in such cases

94
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:41,710
that the organism wants to destroy itself.

95
00:15:43,460 --> 00:16:04,190
You must have heard that the autoimmune diseases – the conventional idea-

96
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:14,560
is the organism against himself. Killing it’s own self. This is the idea, why?

97
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:22,540
The organism could not face certain problems in life.

98
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:53,910
You will have also to understand that the idea of self-destruction, what is behind it?

99
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:09,540
“I am not worth it. I’m nothing. I am not a person who should live in this world etc…”

100
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:23,620
You have to be very careful now here. Who will say this?

101
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:47,540
We try to go to the deepest issue the one who says “I’m not worth living”, who will say it?

102
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:03,880
What is behind? A traumatized ego.

103
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:16,490
Self-importance that was there before and now is destroyed.

104
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:51,040
What could be the cure of a expanded ego? What is the opposite? A person how can overcome it?

105
00:18:52,540 --> 00:19:05,880
A person whose ego says “They don’t recognize me, the world does not recognize my values,

106
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:13,440
therefore it’s not worth for me  living in this world, so I just commit suicide or…

107
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:18,200
It doesn’t matter, the idea is self-destruction.

108
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:29,640
So the idea that I am important person which appears to be a valid idea

109
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:39,860
or an idea acceptable it is this very idea that can destroy the person.

110
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:49,050
I  am important and something has happened, my wife left me. I am important

111
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:54,010
and they kick me out of my job.

112
00:19:54,110 --> 00:20:08,940
I am important and they have behaved very bad to me etc. What would be the cure?

113
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:28,690
Everybody understand of course. The cure is the acceptance of your own inability.

114
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:48,930
This is the cure. Accepting that I am not such a big homeopath that can cure everything.

115
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:58,010
Because if I had this idea, I am big homeopath, I can cure everything and everybody come…

116
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:06,950
Every time there is a failure I will have a big problem.

117
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:16,620
Oh my god, I could not cure him. Even that simple.

118
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:24,300
If you expect that you are the best in your job and you believe it

119
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:35,840
and then proves that this is not so then you are running for a big problem.

120
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:53,820
So I want to connect this with the idea of the levels.

121
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:08,490
Now, in the level 1 we have an organism which is very balanced, that means very healthy.

122
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:18,910
These people are not running this danger I am talking about.

123
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:30,750
The organism now starts getting weaker and weaker and comes down the levels.

124
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:44,330
So, as the organism goes down more and more what happens?

125
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:57,400
The ego becomes bigger and bigger to balance the inefficiencies of the organism.

126
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:10,590
So actually the people who are having an exaggerated ego are the people

127
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:22,650
who are having some deficiencies in several areas because of bad health.

128
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:37,560
If you are a runner, a champion and suddenly you have some problem

129
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:48,140
and you cannot be anymore the champion and you look to others how fast they are running

130
00:23:48,240 --> 00:24:00,490
you may be going crazy imagining that I am still the champion. And then you need a remedy.

131
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:09,660
With the imagination replacing what is missing due to the bad health.

132
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:26,830
So, wait, I will connect it with another idea. The idea of suppression.

133
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:35,430
You know the idea of suppression, I have a pain and I want to suppress the pain.

134
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,170
I don’t want the pain.

135
00:24:37,940 --> 00:25:02,810
The idea of suppression comes when the ego trying to balance under the circumstances

136
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:18,700
which are difficult because of the loss of health they try to excuse and finally to hide the symptoms.

137
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,200
I will give you an example.

138
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:41,510
Somebody comes to the homeopath and you investigate the case and you take all the symptoms

139
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:48,870
and then you come to the mental/emotional sphere. How you are emotionally? I’m well.

140
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:57,290
And you can see he is not well, but his thought is “I am well”.

141
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:13,110
But he has forgotten the mental/emotional state when he was really healthy with joy,

142
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,030
with happiness enjoying things.

143
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:27,030
Now does not enjoy anything is just in a state of a state “I am just existing”

144
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,780
but that state does not bother him anymore.

145
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:51,620
Why? Because he has suppressed the symptom which should bother him, he has accepted

146
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,880
and he has suppressed the symptomatology.

147
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:16,550
So, once the level comes down the cry of the organism through the symptoms is not anymore.

148
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:27,540
The organism does not cry. The patient I mentioned should come to you

149
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:35,530
and tell you “My main complaint is not the knee which is painful,

150
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:51,880
my main problem is that I’ve lost the ability to have joy.” But has covered it.

151
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:05,880
When a healthy person wakes up in the morning always there is happiness it’s another day,

152
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:11,110
enjoying nature, enjoying everything that is around.

153
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:20,730
If you have lost that and you wake up in a depression, eventually,

154
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:29,700
you forget about the old state when you were a child when you were jumping with happiness.

155
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:38,690
That was the real healthy state. When you were a child.

156
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:46,110
What happened? You took the antibiotics, you too the vaccination, you took the stresses of life

157
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:57,550
and you come to a point where you don't want to face your own problems.

158
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:09,040
And the homeopath must read through the lines, must look at the eyes and see the sadness,

159
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:17,770
see the anxiety, see the depression, see the panic, the fears…

160
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:23,280
And then you have to handle it in order to get the information

161
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:38,110
what this organism would have said if he had come to you and it was recently that he was very happy

162
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:48,210
and now he lost his happiness. He would have say “I’m depressed, I’m anxious, I’m angry”.

163
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:54,200
You see the anger, you say:

164
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,630
“Are you angry?
–No

165
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,450
–Are you depressed?
–No”.

166
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:16,640
What is this? This is a hiding. It’s a suppression that has been done through our mental ability.

167
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:30,780
So the suppression that is done through your own automatic systems that are inside

168
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,880
and there is a suppression also done through chemicals.

169
00:30:49,540 --> 00:31:02,540
So when the health has come down to levels, whatever disease imbalance is manifesting

170
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:11,550
in lower levels do not give enough symptoms for you to prescribe. That is the problem.

171
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:31,790
If an organism is depressed, depressed, depressed… ten years of antibiotics every day

172
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:39,110
and the person comes to be treated by you do you believe you can find symptoms?

173
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:53,790
No, all suppressed. So, if you really understand this theory you will be able to really diagnose

174
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,050
what is going on with a patient.

175
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:02,190
When you see a patient you’ll understand he’s very sick,

176
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:05,910
he’s not so sick though he has the same problems, cancer,

177
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:15,810
but no so sick and cancer but, yes, curable. See the difference.

178
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:30,300
Ok, you can ask some more questions. What I said today, I’ve never said before.

179
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:37,960
I don’t remember saying the same things before. So what happens actually,

180
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:50,200
it depends on your intelligence if you put a question that rings a bell in me

181
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:58,720
to stimulate me to speak. Otherwise I can give you very simple answer.

182
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,300
Somebody wanted to talk?

183
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,640
-I’d like to ask a practical question, down-to-earth question.

184
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:28,540
Do you believe that there is more than one remedy at a certain time

185
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,650
that is capable of producing a curative reaction?

186
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:40,690
-Yes, I’ll repeat your question in order to make it clear to everybody.

187
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:50,030
You’re asking whether, at a certain moment, there are several remedies

188
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:57,130
that may have the same effect. My answer is no.

189
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:07,450
There is a possibility that a close remedy can have an effect.

190
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:19,810
But the real, central remedy will have a totally different sense in the perception of the person

191
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:30,320
who receives the correct remedy. His whole organism is rejuvenated. It’s different.

192
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:38,920
I, myself could not find my remedy.

193
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:47,820
You see I started homeopathy at the age of 27, I am 80 now, about 53 years.

194
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:56,080
I could not find my remedy. I would prescribe close remedies to myself.

195
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:07,740
Somebody [would say] “I don’t believe you”. I’ll tell you it different.

196
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,990
For all acutes, because I’ve never taken any chemical drugs for all my life,

197
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:25,480
but I had several acutes and severe acutes… all the acutes I managed with Homeopathy

198
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:31,900
without problem and then if you don’t get the right remedy by that time…

199
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:41,980
I remember one case I just say it quickly I was vomiting blood and stool with blood

200
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,150
because of poisoning of the organism, tremendous poisoning

201
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:59,070
and I was a terrible state and I took one remedy of course that didn’t act ,

202
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:08,260
the second didn’t act, the third remedy acted, cut down the whole thing.

203
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:14,980
And many times it’s like that.

204
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:22,570
When I start having an acute I cannot find immediately the first remedy, the second remedy…

205
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:34,560
but you see the first remedy will bring some changes and then eventually

206
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:44,820
if you’re not afraid of dying and you know Homeopathy then you’ll always manage.

207
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,020
This is my experience, that’s why I’m still alive.

208
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:55,070
Because I had a lot of opportunities to die in my life.

209
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:08,900
But I’ve decided if God wants me to die, I will die but I refuse to go to the hospital,

210
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,670
I refuse to take allopathic drugs. It’s ok.

211
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:27,320
So if you wait long enough the picture of the organism will manifest the remedy.

212
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:35,070
But if you start taking allopathic drugs, take some antibiotics you suppress it.

213
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:41,660
The organism, it is unbelievable perhaps

214
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:51,160
but with few antibiotics may be totally suppressed a situation

215
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:59,320
that will never be freed even with good homeopathic remedies.

216
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:05,320
I had a case of a child 5 year old he had severe pneumonia and was going to die.

217
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:12,070
He took antibiotics. After that he developed Tourette syndrome.

218
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:26,230
Who knows Tourette syndrome? It’s a very bad syndrome where people make jerks…

219
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,350
But very severe.

220
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:32,980
These people when they are in front of others they try to suppress this

221
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,580
and then they go home and the go crazy, like that.

222
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:44,490
They suppress it because they’re in front of others… Tourette syndrome.

223
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:50,840
I’ve been trying for the last 30 years to cure this man. Not possible.

224
00:38:51,590 --> 00:39:10,340
I tried everything I could imagine. Could not free him. 5 years old… and he’s now 50.

225
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:21,730
-What goes on in the organism of this man that he cannot be freed again?

226
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:31,830
That you, cannot heal him, cannot cure…what goes on with the suppression?

227
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:45,170
-I do not know. There are suppressions which are much more easy to get rid of.

228
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:58,120
But there are others suppressions that have been gone so deep into the human cells that… forget it.

229
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:10,180
-The suppression did it depend on the antibiotic that he took?

230
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,530
On the kind of the antibiotics he took?
-On the kind? I cannot say.

231
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:27,510
-This is a question I wanted to ask for many years actually coming here

232
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:31,850
and it comes in the same direction with what you’re saying now.

233
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:38,100
I have seen several cases of what I call – and not only me but also good homeopaths-

234
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,850
“clear Sulphur case”.

235
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:45,600
They take remedy, they have great aggravation, there is an amelioration,

236
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:53,020
there is something going well but they will still have some symptoms like hot feet are there,

237
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,560
the theorizing state is there,

238
00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:02,860
the aversion to shower stays there all the time like years and years and years…

239
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,770
and I was wondering what’s going on?

240
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,930
Is this level of health which requires something else?

241
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:14,100
Of course other remedies have been given in the meanwhile

242
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:24,450
but this essence of theorizing, itchiness… It still stays there and I don’t know.

243
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:34,010
-This is something which I have also faced several times when you have a picture

244
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:37,770
that looks like Sulphur, Natrum muriaticum.

245
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:46,280
You give Nat-m. and the keynotes remain in spite of the fact you have given the remedy.

246
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,620
Salt remains...

247
00:41:49,380 --> 00:42:03,190
What I’ve hound out in such cases, in spite of the fact that there is this clear picture,

248
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:08,080
there is something that prevents the remedy from acting.

249
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:20,980
And that something comes usually from either an acute or a stress

250
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:29,340
which is hidden from your information.

251
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:43,650
For instance, Sulphur especially, because they theorize and they explain everything

252
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:56,310
and they have gone through an emotional grief which needed Ignatia

253
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:01,090
but they never took it because they did not know an homeopath,

254
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:09,660
they managed to put aside this picture of Ign.

255
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:17,820
And if you give Ign. in spite of the fact the picture is not there,

256
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:29,590
maybe one keynote Ign. is there, ok, you give Ign. and then you give Sulphur, then Sulphur will act.

257
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:43,330
I have some such cases which I know. I don’t know if the case you’re talking about that is…

258
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:50,190
-I had several of them, even cases of other homeopaths whom I trust

259
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:54,020
and I have seen this and I can’t rely on this

260
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,910
because I have a personal relationship with a Sulphur

261
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:02,990
and I’ve managed over the years to find out the very deep emotional trauma

262
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:09,650
which was hidden but then a recent case which I looked after 3 years of treating

263
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:17,990
and going around Sulph., Lyc. I gave Tuberculinum and had a reaction…

264
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:23,990
I don’t know it’s not long term right now, so I don’t know if something will change in long term.

265
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:29,320
But I really have this dilemma what to do. Where to look to change something…

266
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:40,830
-Yes. For instance, because you mentioned Tub. may be a tubercular miasm is prominent

267
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:46,540
and does not allow and needs first Tub. and then...

268
00:44:47,840 --> 00:45:01,670
It can be possible. That is why we have difficulty with this kind of treatment.

269
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:10,330
You’re here because you want the excellent, you want the best

270
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:18,490
and you have travelled all this way  to see whether you can get the best.

271
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:26,750
So you are the exception.

272
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:42,010
The most of homeopaths are happy with giving several remedies at a time and see some effect.

273
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:51,330
I give 10 remedies, 3 remedies together, 4 remedies together, 5 remedies together

274
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:59,330
or a bluff myself in giving thin air and comes the person

275
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:07,580
and tells you “I think, maybe I’m better”. And things are going on like this.

276
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:17,300
But once you’re dissatisfied with this kind of situation then you say maybe there is another way.

277
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,490
And this other way is difficult.

278
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:34,910
Because you are trying to find the exact vibrational frequency of the person

279
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:53,590
within millions, billions of frequencies and stimulate the organism by the correct frequency.

280
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:57,240
And you need all the information possible.

281
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:09,170
And in the meantime the organism by having a medical history has hidden the information.

282
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:25,440
When you go to 7-9 levels information is hidden. Does not flow, does not come out.

283
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:35,510
You have to dig it out and there are the most chronic conditions.

284
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:42,740
And you may be battling for years with some people just

285
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:50,010
because they feel a little bit better here and there, they stick with you and you try.

286
00:47:51,260 --> 00:48:01,820
My advice in such cases is give a lot of placebo. Even if the person complains.

287
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:11,410
You have given 10 remedies in the last 2 years and you see no real effect, give placebo

288
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:19,430
and find out what is the truth about the reaction of the organism.

289
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:30,330
-In such cases of Sulphur relapse or not really improving,

290
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:37,570
I was thinking about the behavior or lifestyle that produces the relapse

291
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:43,420
maybe a life partner that brings the same miasm…

292
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:48,410
-That is another story.  What you say is correct.

293
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:54,490
Which means you may give the right remedy but the lifestyle of the person is such

294
00:48:54,590 --> 00:49:00,820
that brings a relapse very quickly.

295
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:06,910
You expect that remedy 200 you have given will last at least 6 months

296
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,080
and in 3 weeks there is a relapse.

297
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:19,830
In such a case you will see first a good reaction and then a relapse.

298
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:28,100
That means the person is drinking a lot of alcohol or the person takes drugs, hashish.

299
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:37,770
Many young people think that if I take hashish is normal, no problem. There is a problem.

300
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:52,990
In such a case your remedy must have shown a very good effect in the beginning.

301
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:10,430
-What you asked first about the Sulphur or Natrum muriaticum with the clear picture

302
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:13,890
and the good reaction, aggravation, amelioration etc.

303
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:20,880
but still there are some keynotes like hot feet, theorizing or desire salt,

304
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:27,670
I want to ask is this a disease to be cured?

305
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:35,640
If someone likes salt being Natrum muriaticum or theorizing if he/she is happy

306
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:42,420
and there is no previous very serious problems.

307
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:49,980
Maybe it’s something very little sign that the organism needs to be in balance.

308
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,910
Is it to be cured or not?

309
00:50:54,420 --> 00:51:07,320
- I don’t know if I understood your question but let us say a person has a symptom theorizing

310
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:16,050
and you give a remedy and you expect stop theorizing from the one day to another,

311
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,250
this is not correct.

312
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:27,390
First of all, in order to consider a symptom theorizing,

313
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:35,240
because it’s a matter of judgment, what do you think is really theorizing

314
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:41,020
or he has some points in explaining certain things.

315
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:52,520
Theorizing as a symptom it is like this when a person comes and you ask a question

316
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:57,900
and the person starts talking, explaining, saying this, saying that

317
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,200
and after a quarter of an hour talking, talking making different theories about  this,

318
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:13,870
about that, then the idea of theorizing comes to your mind as a symptom.

319
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:21,950
But if you ask him “What do you think, why you are sick? Why you are in such a state?”

320
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:25,370
and he explains to you in a logical way,

321
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:33,420
gives you a theory why he is so sick, “because, as a child, I was mistreated by my parents

322
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:46,470
and my mother left…” and gives you a story… this is not theorizing. Theorizing is pathology.

323
00:52:49,470 --> 00:53:10,540
I had a case recently. I saw privately a case and I put a question “What do you have?”

324
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:22,780
and she started talking about all kinds of things, jumping from one place to the other…

325
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:32,790
So she know Homeopathy, she knows Materia Medica and then I did not know how to say,

326
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:38,530
she would be offended she needed Lachesis, so anyhow,

327
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:50,630
I told her “Take a dose of Lachesis” she says “Me, Lachesis?”. I said “Yes, this is what I think”.

328
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:55,720
“Do you think that I’m loquacious?

329
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:04,130
–Yes maybe when you were talking to me you were loquacious.

330
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:19,900
–Only to you!”. You cannot imagine the lack of self-observation in such persons.

331
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:28,220
Then you realize, because you let them talk, talk, when he is going to stop?

332
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:34,380
Of course if you don’t have time, the next patient is waiting, you say “Ok, thank you.

333
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:42,730
Take Lachesis, go”. But it is true.

334
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:53,480
The person who is under examination and who has such problems like theorizing

335
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:59,960
they don’t realize it themselves because they feel they have to say this.

336
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:09,960
They cannot stop doing it. But it will be excessive to the point where it is impressive.

337
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:13,210
Then you can take it as a symptom. Then you give the remedy.

338
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:18,320
Then do you expect to stop theorizing? No.

339
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:32,960
You expect to reduce this excessive theorizing tendency.

340
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:41,380
So still will keep on theorizing, searching etc. but will be reduced definitely.

341
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:46,460
And people who are living next to them, if you inquire, they will confirm.

342
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:51,410
“Yes he’s not theorizing so much anymore”.

343
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:58,550
But will not stop because each person has its own personality

344
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:06,800
and this belongs to the personality traits, personality points.

345
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,300
You’re not going to change the personality, of course.

346
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:18,380
We don’t change personalities of the people. But if you are under Stram.

347
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:26,970
and you want to bite and to kill…

348
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:33,050
This is not your personality, of course, so give the Stram.

349
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:43,170
and the person will reduce its aggressiveness but still will be an aggressive child.

350
00:56:44,230 --> 00:57:03,810
But not to that extreme. Speak.

351
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:14,560
Which part of India you come? Gujarat? And you? Bangalore, the best place in India.

352
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:20,070
I like Bangalore. The best climate.

353
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:32,670
-In the explanation of levels of health, when we get acute under…

354
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:35,970
I’m having the question regarding changing the remedy

355
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:39,630
when we need to give an acute remedy there are some indication

356
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:43,380
and when we need to give a chronic remedy there are some indications…

357
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:50,880
Now as for the basic qualifications of vital force, the vital force is unintelligent.

358
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:56,070
The moment we give an acute remedy it will react in that way,

359
00:57:56,170 --> 00:58:00,080
the moment we give a chronic remedy it will react in a chronic way, right?

360
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:05,820
So my point is when we should change the remedy, how much time we should have in our hand…?

361
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:14,910
-Between acute and chronic or generally?
–Between acute and chronic.

362
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:22,420
Suppose the acute medicine is working in that case, is it right to enter with the chronic one?

363
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:34,820
-You see the experience shows that in the upper levels of health

364
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:41,320
the best way to give the chronic is after the acute.

365
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:56,070
After the acute the organism is in a sensitive state and will give out more clear chronic symptoms.

366
00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:00,580
So that is your best time.

367
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:09,340
You wait 1-3 weeks and then this is the best time to prescribe chronically.

368
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:23,670
But if the person is in –let us say- level 6.

369
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:36,590
In level 6 you may expect the acutes will follow one another. You will have a lot of acutes.

370
00:59:37,330 --> 00:59:42,780
So if you have been treating a person without acutes

371
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:50,490
and suddenly he starts developing acutes that’s different.

372
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:58,240
Then you wait, don’t touch again the chronic case

373
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:04,240
because most probably this person will develop another acute and another acute

374
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:09,090
and he will be coming to you with acutes.

375
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:17,240
Before you have prescribed correctly for all these acutes

376
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:23,820
you will not have a clear picture of new his chronic condition,

377
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,680
from level 6 bringing to level 5 for instance.

378
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:50,820
The good thing for you in India is that the cases you see are mostly physical pathologies

379
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:57,160
and this is so nice to treat because you find the remedy quite easily.

380
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:04,740
But the moment this has been suppressed and you will be getting this problem more and more

381
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:10,580
because of modern medicine there, they people they start taking antibiotics,

382
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,160
cortisone etc. you will have more.

383
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:17,920
The moment this is suppressed and modified

384
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:23,330
and the problem goes to the mental/emotional state,

385
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:28,820
during that time you will have bigger problems.

386
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:37,680
By the time I was living in India in the 1960s the cases were all very simple…

387
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:55,660
Unfortunately they will destroy your race as well. Our race has been destroyed already,

388
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:07,160
the south America still is good – not Argentina so much

389
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:11,660
because Argentina has a lot of antibiotics.

390
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:30,010
But Venezuela… How they destroy these people… They don’t realize what they’re doing.

391
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:48,010
The craziness is this; you give vaccination, you destroy the health in general

392
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:53,990
and you push the imbalance towards mental/ emotional states.

393
01:02:54,090 --> 01:02:58,850
Then because of that people are living longer.

394
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:05,330
Because if the problem goes to the mental/ emotional the body remains intact

395
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:17,260
and does not die so in the statistics it appears here we have raised the mode of life.

396
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:30,660
Yes, but making crazy people, with Alzheimer, with neuromuscular diseases,

397
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:35,420
multiple sclerosis, all kinds of autoimmune diseases etc.

398
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,910
You don’t realize this? No.

399
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:44,330
-I have a question but before I want to mention I just heard this terrible statistics

400
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:57,020
that 50% of people in the 70s and 80s in the West suffer from various degrees of dementia.

401
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:01,100
–It’s unbelievable.

402
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:13,420
–I have a question about the Sulphur case.

403
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:23,670
Some people were saying that the symptoms of the disease are very very deep, hidden.

404
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:30,750
Some people will say it needs a syphilitic remedy then. You don’t agree?

405
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:38,740
-That is true maybe but which one? Ok, they need a syphilitic remedy

406
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:43,070
but just to give Syphillinum to everyone is wrong.

407
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:50,070
I have seen some bad reactions from Syphillinum giving it just like this

408
01:04:50,170 --> 01:05:01,060
a guru in America he knew something like Homeopathy…

409
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:08,320
There was a medical doctor who became my student and he was telling me “Any newcomer”,

410
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:16,320
he was coming to the ashram he would receive a dose of Syph. 10M, a dose of Med. 10M,

411
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:22,080
a dose of Tub. 10M and a dose of Carc. 10M.

412
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:33,070
And several times to clear up the case. After that people became zombies.

413
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:42,820
I could see people losing their ability to think.

414
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:52,900
It’s not simple, just throw remedies, high potencies without knowing what you are doing.

415
01:05:53,910 --> 01:05:55,140
It’s terrible.

416
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:17,040
-Do you think because of that humanity is undergoing a deeper miasmatic disease

417
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:26,040
that is why people just from the start being not level 1 but lower level in general

418
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:30,880
because of that suppression, miasmatic and hereditary conditions,

419
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:35,050
it’s not that I agree with this…

420
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:45,200
-It is correct what you say. People start in a low level from the very beginning,

421
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:48,300
from their birth.

422
01:06:49,800 --> 01:07:00,230
The more we wait with that situation, the more people will be born on a low level.

423
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:07,220
But how do you cure this? How do you treat that? That’s another matter.

424
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:20,380
We have a tool which is fantastic. We have the symptoms of the patient to guide us.

425
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:27,450
If you forget the symptoms and go into a theory and according to that theory

426
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:34,820
you give this or that remedy you may forget about curing people.

427
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:40,450
- Just a question about a personal case that I had.

428
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:56,880
He’s a patient 21 years old and he’s got a cancer in the tongue

429
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:02,200
and being so young I finally gave him before he was operated

430
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:21,540
and his tongue has been almost removed and he had a plastic in it..

431
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,480
I just wondered in what level of health was this guy.

432
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:29,200
He’s 21 years old, he’s been healthy…

433
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:40,710
-Is he still alive?
–Yes he’s still alive, 6 months…

434
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:46,290
And his finally gave him Kali cyanatum it was the only specific remedy for that.

435
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:49,780
I mean there are a lot of remedies…

436
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:56,540
But what’s your opinion of o person being so young with such a cancer

437
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:01,890
what level of health is he? A,B,C,D?

438
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:12,630
-If the remedy is not clear then belongs to 8 or 9 level.

439
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:24,300
If you manage to treat him and bring out a clear picture

440
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:29,980
then the first thing that you will see is developing a very high fever.

441
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:33,120
Is not…?

442
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:39,710
But it’s very interesting that I have also said many years ago

443
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:52,210
that all diseases are of inflammatory type. Chronic and acute.

444
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:58,710
Because inflammation is the way to cure.

445
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:03,370
The organism cures through inflammation.

446
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:11,370
What becomes an acute inflammation if suppressed

447
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:17,870
becomes sub-acute inflammatory process

448
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:26,790
and the organism does not have anymore the strength to develop really an inflammation.

449
01:10:26,890 --> 01:10:29,990
And tries, sub-acute…

450
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:37,620
That’s why you get the inflammatory processes in rheumatoid arthritis,

451
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:48,120
the inflammation in the joint, lupus erythematous, the autoimmune diseases.

452
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:53,230
You get exacerbations and reductions.

453
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:05,880
-In rheumatoid arthritis having exacerbation is good?

454
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:10,220
-If he has a high fever there is a possibility of cure after that.

455
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:36,150
These are simple things that centuries of medical knowledge has not brought out.

456
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:41,660
And they wait for me to say, I couldn’t believe it.

457
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:49,870
Sometimes when I said things I said it with timidity

458
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:55,630
because they thought what are you talking… Somebody will come up

459
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:58,400
and say how do you know?

460
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:10,540
And I remember a few years later one student of mine, a medical doctor he found a research

461
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:25,250
in which they said schizophrenia was of an inflammatory type disease.

462
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:33,270
And he said “Teacher, look! They have found out what you were saying a few years ago “.

463
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:40,420
And now they realize more and more this kind of process

464
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:49,770
which is going on but they don’t want to stop the process of suppressing inflammation.

465
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:58,010
“Inflammation? Take anti-inflammatory drugs”.

466
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:11,670
-It’s the same with the cardiac diseases, you noticed after arteriosclerosis,

467
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:27,600
in females we have a lot of heart attacks and then they found out you need to reduce the fat

468
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:34,800
and the cholesterol and they have heavy remedies to lower this cholesterol.

469
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:48,160
Now they found out that actually there is an inflammation. The same idea.

470
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:51,400
- Now they will find out of course.

471
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:59,990
Because these things that I have said are all observation from real life.

472
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:14,140
-I just also want to comment on that. Quite many years ago

473
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:24,390
I read that it is an inflammatory condition of the blood vessels,

474
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:26,650
it doesn’t matter that they know that.

475
01:14:26,750 --> 01:14:35,000
Even if they know they still fight the cholesterol, it doesn’t matter.

476
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:44,310
-I’m just wondering with the levels of health the first states the upper are inflammatory

477
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:52,890
and as you said so often if this is suppressed by medication and it gets deeper and deeper

478
01:14:52,990 --> 01:15:02,210
and the body starts from inflammation and the starts the next level in the chronic disease

479
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:11,210
is when you have like psychotic appearance. Later if you suppress more and more

480
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:14,960
and the health goes down it starts α self-destruction.

481
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:18,460
And you said this morning where we were talking about the suppression,

482
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:24,460
the self- destruction that this syphillitic this is found in Hahnemann

483
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:34,050
when he says you have the miasm where you walk, where the organism goes through

484
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:35,970
and it is very similar, isn’t it?

485
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:45,960
-Very similar. The problem with the idea of Hahnemann is that you cannot really

486
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:57,970
because you suspect that the person had in his ancestry syphilis automatically give

487
01:15:58,070 --> 01:16:03,540
without taking the symptoms give anti-syphilitic.

488
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:09,800
One thinks anti-syphilitic is Syph. the other thinks it’s Merc.

489
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,890
and the third thinks it’s Aur.

490
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:22,880
All kinds of remedies are there from which you choose according to the symptoms, of course.

491
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:27,710
But this is the idea of Hahnemann because he had observed it.

492
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:37,900
What I have said is in accordance with the ideas of Hahnemann. Absolutely.

493
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:57,740
That’s why they accuse me of being… you know George is talking about Hahnemann, old stuff.

494
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:07,980
-It’s still not clear between the period we should leave before changing the remedy.

495
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:17,650
-I do not understand because of your accent. You have to speak more slowly, like me.

496
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:27,070
-How much time we should give between changing the remedy?

497
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:41,210
-Depends on the emergency of the case you treat. If you treat an emergency case

498
01:17:41,310 --> 01:17:47,300
and you give a remedy that has not acted you can change it after a few hours.

499
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:57,100
If you treat chronic cases and you want a time for observation

500
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:02,640
the least time will be 1 month.

501
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:16,320
Once you see something is going on then you wait and then you wait...give placebo.

502
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:27,710
Many times after a month they have come and they told me I’m the same

503
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:37,220
but I don’t take it as such I want to really be sure he’s the same.

504
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:54,460
So I inquire and if I see especially a mental or emotional symptom

505
01:18:54,560 --> 01:19:10,970
which is better I don’t care if he has psoriasis, eczema or stomach pain

506
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:23,570
which is the same I will wait one month more to see whether this amelioration is really

507
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:30,410
because of the remedy and therefore will bring about the cure of the physical body.

508
01:19:41,330 --> 01:19:52,740
OK. In the next days in the afternoon we will see a real case

509
01:19:52,840 --> 01:20:00,980
and we can have time to discuss about a real case. I don’t know the case.

510
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:07,080
I have never seen it. And usually I never know about the case.

511
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:20,420
So I have the same information as yourself. So we are on an equal level.

512
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:25,910
Thank you.
