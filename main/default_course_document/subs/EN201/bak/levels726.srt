1
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,590
- This nice gentleman comes from Sweden.

2
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:28,900
33 years old and the main complaint is sleeplessness for maybe 15-20.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,820
- Or maybe longer.

4
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:40,240
- From slightest noise impossible to sleep, waking from slightest noise.

5
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,140
And takes 3-4 hours to fall asleep.
- Yes, that’s a big problem.

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,060
- Why do you think this happens to you?

7
00:00:51,420 --> 00:01:01,050
What you’re saying is when you were about 13 something happened to you.

8
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:08,500
- Something happened a little bit earlier. I was frightened when I was little boy.

9
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:16,740
- At what age?
- Maybe 6-7, I’m not sure.

10
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:24,890
I was sleeping in my bed and I woke up and I had a delusion.

11
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,160
I saw a man standing with a knife.

12
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,050
I saw the silhouette on the door from inside the room

13
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,540
and I though a man stood there with a knife.

14
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,550
- Was trying to kill you?
- Yes.

15
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,320
I turned around and faced the wall. It was really scary.

16
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,640
- So you turned around and faced the wall but trembling.

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,050
And do you think from that incident started the sleeplessness?

18
00:01:53,150 --> 00:02:03,640
- It could be. I don’t like to be alone. And I think it started from then.

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,290
- Can you tell me the remedies that you have taken?

20
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:30,800
You say you took about 20 remedies so far?
- Yes. I don’t know in what order.

21
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,400
- Ok, it doesn’t matter, just the names.

22
00:02:33,450 --> 00:03:01,050
- Phos, stram, calc, sulph, lyc, puls, calad, nux-v, merc, thuja, nat-m,

23
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:45,210
tub, psor, aeth, staph, sil, op, med, lac-c, lach, caust, kali-c, nat-c, nat-br.

24
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,360
- Three homeopaths gave all these remedies.

25
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:58,540
- It was one homeopath. One has given the most.

26
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,860
- They gave one remedy at a time or sometimes 2-3 remedies?

27
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,710
- Before all these I also took some mixed remedies.

28
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:18,710
- By a homeopath or you got it yourself?
- By a homeopath.

29
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:24,360
- Do you remember what age you went the first time to an homeopath?

30
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,380
- When I was 20.

31
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,040
- And you went for this problem?

32
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:46,140
- No, I went for my knee. That was treated by mixed remedies.

33
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:54,540
- And the sleeplessness was there?
- Before, yes.

34
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,530
- Never was affected by any of these?
- No.

35
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,530
- But you said one remedy..

36
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:06,670
- Yes, one remedy, phos. But it only lasted for 2 weeks.

37
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,630
And I tried all different kinds of potencies.

38
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:20,300
- When you said first words I just wrote down phos and the first remedy you said was phos.

39
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:34,290
We’ll see now what happens. Do you remember if you took acon?

40
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:41,110
- I took it for acutes. Never for…

41
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,630
- Ign?
- No. I never took it.

42
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:04,440
- So when you go to bed, you’re sleepy or you’re not sleepy?

43
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,530
- I can be very sleepy.

44
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:15,340
- You turn around and then you become sleepless?
- Yes.

45
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,380
- For 3-4 hours turn around in bed.
- Sometimes.

46
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:29,490
- And when you wake up you are tired, unrefreshed or you are not tired?

47
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,920
- I’m tired when I wake but as soon as I’m off of the bed, it’s ok.

48
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,670
Even if I sleep 2 hours. I feel ok.

49
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:54,160
- So, once you fall asleep you don’t wake up till…

50
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:03,600
- Yes, Many times. I easily fall asleep again after I wake up.

51
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,330
- Have you also taken sulph?
- Yes.

52
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,260
- You did not mention it.
- I think I did.

53
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,530
- Ah, yes. No effect?
- No.

54
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,840
- You have taken sep?
- No.

55
00:07:50,860 --> 00:08:00,920
- Tell me what else do you have.
- I have a ganglion in the wrist. A small one.

56
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,660
- Do you have pain in the wrist?
- Yes, very much.

57
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,410
- Pain in which wrist?

58
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,660
- In the right one, also in the left but not too much.

59
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,170
- In the wrist.
- Yes.

60
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,250
- In the knee also you said?

61
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:23,430
- No. Right and left wrist. But more in the right.

62
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:43,420
I think the pain in the wrists is worse when it’s cold.

63
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,670
- But you’re not sure.
- No, I’m not sure.

64
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,830
- When it’s wet?
- No.

65
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:05,430
I have more pain when I have used the wrist. Doing massage or carrying heavy things.

66
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,340
- You are doing massage.
- Yes.

67
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:31,640
- Your legs in bed are also restless?
- No.

68
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,290
- In general you just turn around, all the body, and not the…

69
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:45,630
- Usually I start on the back and I finish on the back, I sleep on the back.

70
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,880
In between I turn around. All sides, without a problem.

71
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:02,190
And I’m thinking a lot about everything…

72
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,530
- During the time of sleeplessness?
- Yes.

73
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:13,190
- All the good or bad things come to you?
- Both.

74
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,940
And in the summer I have also allergy.

75
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:56,780
- You mean July, August?
- June and July.

76
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,670
- These 2 months. And you have allergies or hay fever?

77
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,270
- Hay fever.

78
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:13,100
- Never asthma?
- No.

79
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,120
- You are an athlete. You like gymnastics.
- Yes.

80
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:43,780
- The lacrimation is acrid. And in the night my eyes they stick together.

81
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:52,770
That’s the whole year, not only in the summer.

82
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:15,690
Maybe it’s because the dog is sleeping in my bed. And I had a very severe pain in my anus.

83
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,350
- What kind of pain?

84
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:25,830
- Cramping pain. It comes about 2-3 times a year.

85
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,850
And the last time I had it was very severe, I almost fainted. Cold perspiration.

86
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:34,830
- It extends upwards the pain or it is local?

87
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,690
- Yes, it is local.

88
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,590
- Like a cramp? Like constriction?
- Yes.

89
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,840
- Very severe?
- Yes.

90
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,890
- And every time it happened at a specific hour in the morning…?

91
00:12:51,990 --> 00:13:00,840
- Only in the night. The severe cramps come always in the night

92
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:09,940
but sometimes also very small cramps before stool, during the day also.

93
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:37,180
But the severe pain cramps is only in the night. Sensitive to cold. I get pain in my throat.

94
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:48,990
- Cold and wet? Or only cold? You don’t realize the wet. The drafts?

95
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,840
- I don’t like drafts…

96
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:57,330
I like it here because I’m very warm but usually I don’t like drafts.

97
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:04,690
Even if I’m hot and there is wind or drafts, I don’t want.

98
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,750
- What do you feel?
- Feverish.

99
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:27,070
And pain in the throat. I have a lot of dreams, several times every night.

100
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,070
- What kind of dreams?

101
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:39,750
- Many times I dream that I am being murdered. I am about to die.

102
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:57,250
I can feel life is running out. That I can be shot.

103
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,910
- You parents were separated?
- No.

104
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:08,410
- They live together.
- Yes.

105
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,490
- You have brothers and sisters?
- One little sister.

106
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,630
- And you have been rejected by your parents?

107
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:26,630
- No, I don’t think so. Not rejected but maybe not so much loved...

108
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:34,140
hugs and kisses and telling “I love you…”

109
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:41,430
- Swedish are not very…
- No, we are not like that.

110
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,980
- Your sister, you have a good contact?
- Yes.

111
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:31,310
- And was any incident, where the parents they left you as a little child

112
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,790
and you got afraid?
- Not that I remember.

113
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,290
Once they were about to separate.

114
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:50,140
- What age you were?
- Maybe 10-11.

115
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:58,640
Maybe smaller, I don’t remember. They didn’t.

116
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,880
- But did you hear them fighting?
- No.

117
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:18,880
- Do you sigh sometimes?
- Sometimes.

118
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:30,720
- Fruits you eat?
- I like bananas.

119
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:43,370
Maybe it is because they are easy to eat. But I also like some apples.

120
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:51,110
Not too sweet apples because then I have problems with the teeth if they are too sweet.

121
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,890
- Have you taken rhus-t?

122
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:19,300
- I don’t think I’ve taken this only for acutes. I also took it for lumbago. It didn’t help.

123
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:29,950
- You have fears?

124
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:37,790
- I have a very big fear of snakes. I don’t like snakes. I usually dream of snakes.

125
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,370
- What else? Fear of being alone?
- Yes.

126
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:56,640
I think it’s because of the fright when I was a little boy.

127
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,540
And there have also been a couple of other frights in my life.

128
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:25,780
Maybe 10-12 years ago I was in a bad company with bad friends and we went by car

129
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:33,470
and one guy was driving and we were not going together.

130
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:43,370
I saw they were looking each other suspiciously and one person behind me took out a gun

131
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,970
and put it in my head.

132
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,610
- He put it to your head and then he said anything? Either do this or what…?

133
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,720
- He didn’t say anything.

134
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,940
- Wait a moment, I didn’t understand. You were in a car.

135
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,520
And the person who was sitting behind you… You were driving?

136
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:09,260
- No. I was in the front seat but I was not driving.

137
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,870
- He was alone in the back.
- Yes.

138
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:19,040
- So just to show off? Why he did this?
- I don’t remember.

139
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:31,880
- How old you were?
- Maybe 10-12 years ago. Maybe I was 20.

140
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,770
- You were 20 and he was?

141
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:43,020
- Same age. There was also another time…

142
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,520
- No, wait a moment. He put the gun and he didn’t say anything.

143
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,270
- No.

144
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,880
- Swedish?
- Yes.

145
00:20:52,620 --> 00:21:00,370
- You don’t talk very much in Sweden. Quite closed.

146
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:06,110
What did you feel?
- I don’t remember.

147
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,610
But what I remember is that the thing that happened to me

148
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,360
when I was a boy has affected me most.

149
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,030
- With the dream?
- No with the person.

150
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:25,040
- You think you were awake in the night?
- I was awake.

151
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,790
- But it was not a real person.

152
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:36,870
- No there was this silver on the door that looked like a knife and then I hallucinated a man.

153
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,010
- With your imagination you made it?
- Yes.

154
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:50,060
Maybe there was one I don’t know. I can’t say for sure. But I hope there wasn’t.

155
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,890
It must have been  my father.

156
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,900
- Maybe it was your father?
- I hope not.

157
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:09,550
- You felt it might have been your father?
- No, I don’t know.

158
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,650
- Later on you thought maybe it’s your father?

159
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,060
- He didn’t have a knife. The knife was only the silver.

160
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:23,140
I saw the silver on the sides of the door and then I thought it was a knife.

161
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:38,050
But also I have pain in my lumbar region, very much when I’m standing too long

162
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,640
or walking too slow. You know, window shopping.

163
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,390
Also when I’m lying too long in bed.

164
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,400
And also pain here in the side but not so much now as before.

165
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,830
- Like a cramp?

166
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:37,150
- No like sore pain. When I’m running, jogging or walking fast.

167
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,540
- When you do exercise, after the exercise?

168
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,040
- No, just walking or running.

169
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,800
- You feel good after the exercise?

170
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:55,790
- Yes, very good but only after I when I am at the gym. It makes me feel good.

171
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:02,510
I don’t have to go out to walk or do anything else.

172
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:08,460
- When you are doing the gym work then afterwards you feel good.

173
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,060
- Yes.

174
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:30,210
- You are careful with your food? You are health conscious?

175
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,290
- Yes.

176
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:37,150
- You don’t eat junk?
- I eat a lot of chocolate. Too much.

177
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,800
- What about salt? How much?

178
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:49,400
- I don’t use much salt but I could use. I like it.

179
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,040
- How much is your thirst?

180
00:24:54,140 --> 00:25:02,060
- It’s different. Sometimes I am very thirsty sometimes I drink one glass for a day.

181
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:06,300
- The water must be cold?
- Yes.

182
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,640
- From the refrigerator.
- Maybe not from the refrigerator but from the tap.

183
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,650
- But not much.
- When I drink I drink a lot. Big glasses.

184
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,290
- How many glasses? You can drink 3 glasses?

185
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:45,730
- No, but maybe one of half liter. I always stop day by drinking one glass of water a day.

186
00:25:52,480 --> 00:26:00,130
- In your younger years did you do something that affected your conscience?

187
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,710
Do you understand what it means?

188
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:07,710
It means you did something and you felt wrong.

189
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:15,460
- Yes. You want to know?

190
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:29,040
- Yes, if you can say.
- I did a robbery.

191
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:38,800
- At what age?
- 20 maybe.

192
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:49,540
- And they caught you?
- After 4 years they caught me.

193
00:26:52,290 --> 00:27:00,970
- But did you hurt somebody during the robbery?
- Not physically.

194
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:08,540
- You didn’t fight. You didn’t encounter some other people.

195
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,470
- No but I used to.

196
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:17,980
- To fight?
- Yes. But that was long time ago.

197
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,370
- With what?
- With my hands.

198
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:35,120
- I mean by Japanese fight or boxing or just fighting?

199
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,480
- What do you mean?

200
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:41,690
- Like karate?

201
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:48,040
- I did tae kwon do for 10 years. Boxes and kicks.

202
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,050
- So you are a dangerous guy.
- No.

203
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:04,800
I don’t want to hurt anyone. I don’t like to fight. I used to but not any more.

204
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,800
I like to train fight.

205
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,710
- You like to train yourself or you like to train others?

206
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,550
- No, to train myself.

207
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:23,300
- To be ready in case somebody attacks you.
- Maybe not for that but I like it.

208
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,190
But I don’t want to fight others if it’s not controlled in the ring…

209
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,360
- When they caught you, they put you in jail?
- Yes.

210
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:39,700
- For how long?
- 4 days. It’s not so long.

211
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:48,040
- And you felt very bad about it, because they caught you.

212
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:55,540
- No, I think it’s good they caught me because it was always in the back.

213
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,220
- You were carrying it?
- Yes.

214
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,610
- And the others? You were alone? They caught the others?

215
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,300
- They caught two. One is free.

216
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:20,050
- They caught you and another one.
- Me and two others.

217
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,930
- You were 4.
- Yes.

218
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:30,720
- And the other… You did not give his name.
- No. I would never do that.

219
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:46,820
- You weep easily?
- Very sensitive but mostly when I am alone.

220
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:01,590
Weep most often when I am happy, when I’m seeing things on TV,

221
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:07,940
people helping each other or doing nice things.

222
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:23,410
- You never got coff?
- No. I never drink coffee.

223
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,010
- You never drink coffee. You don’t like or because of homeopathy?

224
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,020
- Both.

225
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,520
- If you drink coffee you become overexcited?
- Yes.

226
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,260
- You cannot sleep the whole night?

227
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:53,110
- I’m calm in my nerves but I cannot sleep. I am not restless but I cannot sleep.

228
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,460
- The whole night you can stay awake?

229
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:00,230
-  I think so but it was a long time ago I drank coffee.

230
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:48,840
- Your mind is running fast? That means you lie down and you think this and that…

231
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,760
- I don’t know. I can be very lazy also.

232
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,850
Just lying on the bed on the couch and do nothing.

233
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,680
- Without thoughts.

234
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:08,290
- Watching TV and reading a lot homeopathy every day, several hours.

235
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,680
- In Sweden everyone is allowed to practice homeopathy?

236
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,980
- Yes.

237
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:33,760
- When it was the last time you had the last high fever?

238
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,170
- 6-7 months ago.

239
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,880
- How high?

240
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:45,100
- I’m not sure, maybe 39C. It felt like it. I had illusions.

241
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,020
- You never check.
- No.

242
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,030
- Before this if you remember?
- A couple of years.

243
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,360
- Again high fever?
- Yes.

244
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:03,180
- Your left eye is watery. Is coming some… in your left eye?

245
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,780
- No, I don’t think so.

246
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:25,280
- What else?
- I don’t know. I love animals very much.

247
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:35,530
- You said you were affected when I killed the fly.

248
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:45,030
- A little bit. When I see a fly on floor that is on the back I turn it on its feet again.

249
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:52,430
- That means you cannot watch the killing of even a fly.

250
00:33:52,530 --> 00:34:11,260
- Yes, I can. When I see an animal suffer that suffers really much then I’m crying.

251
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,170
I also like sweets very much. Chocolate.

252
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,430
- Sweets and salt.
- Chocolate.

253
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:49,990
That’s what I like the most. And ice cream, chocolate ice cream.

254
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:57,850
- Are you affected at all by thunderstorms?
- No.

255
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:02,270
- You like thunderstorms?
- No.

256
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:14,290
- What about dark in the room where you sleep.

257
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:25,840
- I want to have some light but I cannot sleep with too much light.

258
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:44,420
- If you are in a high place and you look down you have a problem?

259
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,170
- Yes.

260
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:55,930
- What? You feel fear, vertigo?
- Weak in my knees. A little bit vertigo.

261
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:03,090
- If there is a balcony? Still? You don’t feel good.

262
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,850
- I don’t like it.

263
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:18,010
- If you are expecting for an appointment you will have diarrhea or frequent urination?

264
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:24,010
- Maybe frequent urination today but not usually.

265
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:40,830
- You are very fastidious.
- I can be. Sometimes I can be lazy;

266
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:51,670
I want others to be it for me. I want to have a clean home and everything should be in order.

267
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:57,090
Maybe it’s not always in order but I want it to be.

268
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,500
- You had ear infections?
- Yes.

269
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,860
- With antibiotics.
- Yes.

270
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:13,430
- Now in sleep do you feel any saliva is running out?

271
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,930
- No.

272
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:22,530
- But your gums are not in good condition?
- I think they are.

273
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:37,780
- If you get excited from an emotion, you get very excited?

274
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:48,940
- I think I can be. Before going here to Alonisos or travelling I get excited

275
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,680
and make a list of what I should take with me, make a mark for everything.

276
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:01,350
I like it. In the mornings I have my routines and I’m doing that and then I go by a boat

277
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:09,450
and I’m drinking my hot milk chocolate, always the same thing. I like it.

278
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,850
- But the milk you like?

279
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:18,780
- No, but hot chocolate I drink because it’s chocolate.

280
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:48,790
- Do you have any aggressive thoughts?
- I can.

281
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:55,940
- Concerns what? Killing, hitting?

282
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:05,440
- I’m a peaceful person but only if someone hurts my family I think…

283
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,790
- You’re married?
- No.

284
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,950
- You have a girlfriend?
- Yes.

285
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,980
- Whom would you consider your family? Girlfriend or your real family?

286
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,090
- All of them.

287
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:31,670
- You feel protective.
- If something happen I want to help them.

288
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,050
That’s how I got in trouble also many years ago, I helped my friends.

289
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:44,840
Some other guys came with guns another time.

290
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:52,030
They came and looked for me but they didn’t find me because I helped a friend.

291
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:56,020
He was in a fight and I helped him.

292
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,490
- And you hit the other guys.
- Yes.

293
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,010
- And they wanted to kill you afterwards.

294
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:16,750
- It doesn’t matter who it is or how many people it is I always help my friends

295
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,080
if they have problems.

296
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:31,660
- If somebody says “thank you” to you…
- I can be very sentimental.

297
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,660
- You can cry during that time?

298
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:45,670
- I try to control but it’s mostly my patients they thank me. Then I am sentimental.

299
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:59,160
I never cry when they say “thank you” but I can cry. I have to think of something else.

300
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,920
- You hair stands up. This is what you wanted to say.

301
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,840
- Yes.

302
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:33,520
- I want to ask you if you are jealous. You feel jealousy very strongly?

303
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:49,970
- No, a little bit. It depends on the situation.

304
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:56,470
- Can you tie something around your neck?
- Not too much.

305
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:02,140
- You don’t like it.
- But I can have a turtleneck.

306
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,920
- Can you have a tie?
- Never used.

307
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,700
- Only Greeks wear ties?

308
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:31,500
- I never had the upper button here but I can have a collar.

309
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:48,070
- So you didn’t exactly tell us what you want to do when you have those aggressive thoughts.

310
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:50,410
You did not specify.

311
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:55,820
- It’s not often. I’m not an aggressive person.

312
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:06,750
- So you just sometimes if somebody has hurt you only then you have…

313
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,420
- No.

314
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:17,730
- If there is somebody who has done something wrong with your family

315
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:24,730
then you have thoughts of hitting, killing, how far your thoughts could go?

316
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:30,670
- It depends on the crime but if the crime is severe I could kill them.

317
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:50,920
- Your thought. You will not do it. I hope.
- No, I won’t. It is not often. I promise.

318
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:00,670
- You never got hyos?
- No.

319
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:08,830
- Now I want to ask you something more private. Is it ok?

320
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,860
- No problem.

321
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:17,580
- Sexually, you are normal?
- I think I’m normal, sometimes.

322
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:21,470
- Sometimes you are normal, sometimes you are not normal.

323
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:27,590
- Yes. Sometimes is more, sometimes is less.

324
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:32,800
- With the same girl or you change girls?
- Same girl.

325
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,570
- For how many years?
- 15.

326
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:56,730
- For 15 you have the same girl. You are not married. You could marry, she doesn’t want?

327
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,830
- Yes she wants but it doesn’t matter.

328
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:06,490
- It’s indifferent because in Sweden is not important whether some people are married or not.

329
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:09,350
- Maybe only for the insurance.

330
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:30,320
- We have some Iranians here, their hair will stand up when they hear like this.

331
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:41,890
- I will not marry in a traditional way, maybe in Vegas.

332
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:49,400
- You mean Las Vegas in these little quick ceremonies.

333
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,990
- Yes.

334
00:45:55,750 --> 00:46:00,400
- I had a patient, he had an helicopter.

335
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:06,150
So I was in Berkley, he said I’ll come and take you with the helicopter to Las Vegas

336
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:15,150
because he was staying there. He takes me there with the helicopter, we land in his garden

337
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:25,590
and then we go to the Las Vegas… this crazy thing I’ve never seen in my life.

338
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:32,470
Except of the marriage and all this kind of things, the casinos...

339
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:40,610
Anyhow. But he likes it. You like gambling?

340
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,970
- No, I’m not gambling.

341
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:52,290
- Now you may ask me what are these questions have to do with your remedy.

342
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:58,450
I’m trying to avoid making a mistake.

343
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,180
Because some people will ask me “Why didn’t you ask this why didn’t you ask that?”

344
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,190
So I am asking the questions the people would like to ask.

345
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:15,300
If somebody wants to ask a question please do it.

346
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:22,860
- Hi. Have you got an aversion of quarreling with somebody

347
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,610
are you afraid of quarreling and having…

348
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:30,730
- I don’t like to quarrel. I want peace.

349
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,980
- He wants peace, he said it very clearly.

350
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:46,720
But if somebody does something wrong with his family he can kill him.

351
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:58,120
-… has influenced my thinking a lot.

352
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:01,620
- … he was a great homeopath.

353
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:05,530
- He pointed a couple of thing about op.

354
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:12,750
I would like to ask whether this gentleman can remember with absolute clarity

355
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:16,990
the first young shock he had when he woke at night.

356
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:33,740
Can he remember that incident as if it happened yesterday? Very clear to this day?

357
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:43,180
- Yes, he said. He is very clear to this day.

358
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:52,680
-[…]

359
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:58,590
- Yes, correct, but opium has been given.

360
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:02,830
- What potency?
- 1M.

361
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:10,280
Or 10M or maybe 1M and 10M.
- I would try in low potencies.

362
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,030
- No.

363
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:16,970
- Everything was in high potencies. Every remedy.

364
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,580
- Now I will tell you a few remarks concerning op.

365
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:40,030
You have to remember that op is a remedy that primarily has sleepiness.

366
00:49:40,130 --> 00:50:02,560
This is the main aspect of op. They will sleep very easily and without even a reason.

367
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:11,300
Sitting there, they can fall asleep. So this is the main aspect of op.

368
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:19,160
It very seldom that op goes to the other extreme and becomes sleepless.

369
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:29,790
So this is one point. The second point is that op belongs to people

370
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:40,990
who feel or give you the impression who feel very happy inside.

371
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:52,250
It is a remedy which has a self-satisfying sense. “Good. I’m feeling good.”

372
00:50:52,350 --> 00:51:04,700
That is why in our books says; He says he feels good, while he may be very sick.

373
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:16,130
May be very sick, maybe you expect he is suffering a lot and he is, he says “I feel good.”

374
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:32,870
But the idea with opium therefore is with a person who easily falls asleep

375
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:45,700
but just get the connection with the comatose state. This is a deep sleep.

376
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:53,570
This is a sleep which is in the extreme that means he cannot wake up.

377
00:51:54,050 --> 00:52:06,300
That is why in comatose states we prescribe op, the first remedy we are prescribing is op.

378
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:18,550
And she is right when she says if you have…

379
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:27,450
I’m sleeping without cover with this bloody weather and I got a cold but it doesn’t matter so,

380
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:31,810
ok, I will not postpone the seminar.

381
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:42,920
She is right when she says that if somebody has a big shock, terrifying shock,

382
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:55,280
it can lead him to states of op. Op is one of the remedies that is indicated with sudden shock.

383
00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:05,900
For instance, if at this moment there is an earthquake, you may be moving in your seats,

384
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,390
don’t get up, sit there quietly, there is no problem if that happens

385
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:28,280
because the building is anti-earthquake, it’s built specially for not falling but some of you,

386
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:45,700
you will go to stage of either op or gels or acon, which are the main remedies after a big fright.

387
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,590
Some of you will sit and it will be ok.

388
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:58,740
George says ok, it’s ok. Some will remain with a shock “My God! I am dying”.

389
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:04,120
That feeling can bring about an op state.

390
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:17,610
I’ll give you a very characteristic reaction of a fright and on op state.

391
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:35,500
I was fishing with my nephew, my nephew is 40 years old.

392
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:49,000
We were fishing on a small boat, 5 meters, and I saw a huge boat coming against us,

393
00:54:49,100 --> 00:55:02,570
so I stand up on the boat and I make signs so the captain will see me and change course,

394
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:07,340
cause they were straight upon us.

395
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:27,700
It was full of tourists but the captain, being a Greek, he was driving on the back of the boat,

396
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:37,730
he was driving with this bloody thing but he had next to him a German woman

397
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:44,260
with whom he was flirting very heavily at the moment.

398
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:52,820
So never mind, I saw some people making signs for him to change,

399
00:55:52,920 --> 00:56:01,660
he was so busy with the lady next to him and he didn’t pay attention.

400
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:12,140
So, actually my nephew was sitting on one side and I was sitting on the other side of the boat

401
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,910
and the big boat was coming.

402
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:24,880
And comes exactly on the place where my nephew was sitting hitting us

403
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:43,990
and the last moment he jumps out so high, he says to me “I saw the people on the big boat from up”.

404
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:53,550
I was on the other side the boat turns and I come under the boat

405
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:59,580
and I’m pushing the boat not to get under the boat.

406
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:06,980
And I’m pushing the boat as much as I could and I was saved.

407
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:17,150
In the meantime when he jumped out he shouts me: “I was saved!” I didn’t hear even.

408
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:25,240
Later on he told me. So I can be at ease he was not killed.

409
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:35,900
Anyhow, everything was outside of the boat except of me, I stayed on the boat.

410
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:42,300
Anyhow some petrol was there, jumped and get the petrol out

411
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:51,900
and finally he stopped 20 meters away and he turns around to pick up what is left from us.

412
00:57:55,150 --> 00:58:05,550
Then I said to him “alright, we are saved, it’s ok.” We brought out the broken boat;

413
00:58:05,650 --> 00:58:12,820
it didn’t sink because it had some places which doesn’t sink. We brought it out,

414
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,650
we left it and we went home.

415
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:32,390
I’ll tell you also another point; he had a little dog, he had brought with him.

416
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:39,390
This dog was always with him and he was at our house.

417
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:54,100
I walk first in my house and he is coming about 10 meters away from me

418
00:58:54,200 --> 00:59:04,790
and I see the little dog barking entirely in a fright.

419
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:19,050
As he comes he says hey… the dog goes back, the dogs goes up the stairs

420
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:38,390
and the dog stops against the door upstairs and urinates. A great fright. We don’t pay attention.

421
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:49,580
It’s summer 7 o’clock in the afternoon when it actually happened.

422
00:59:50,350 --> 01:00:03,620
He went to bed and slept from 7 o’clock. 9 o’clock the next day still deeply asleep.

423
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:10,630
10.00, 11.00, 12.00, 13.00… I go there and wake him up

424
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:16,210
and said “Do you want something to eat?” he said no.

425
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:35,610
He has a fever. So I brought a dose of op, 10M and gave it to him. The next day he had recovered.

426
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:53,900
This is the typical type of reaction of op. I give you this idea just to get the idea of the op reaction.

427
01:00:58,410 --> 01:01:05,830
He didn’t feel anything because when we came back home,

428
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:11,310
as we walked to come from the sea to my house,we talked.

429
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:13,560
I asked “Are you afraid?”
– “No, I’m ok.”

430
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,080
- “Are you sure?”
- “Yes.”

431
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:22,660
So I was in peace that he was ok.

432
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:34,800
Actually the shock was so deep that he went into such a deep sleep, almost like a coma,

433
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:47,060
because of the fright. And it was a very interesting phenomenon for me to observe the little dog,

434
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:57,710
who was so connected with him being in such a fright. You couldn’t imagine the fright of the dog.

435
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:07,560
Something was happening. Most probably the dogs are watching, seeing the etheric body.

436
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:28,370
Do you know what the etheric body is? Who does not know what the etheric body is? One person.

437
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:39,190
You take the complete course and you will find out. We are talking about op.

438
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:44,550
Is this man an op case? Yes or no? No.

439
01:02:45,300 --> 01:03:01,610
It can be an acon case? Why not? I’ll tell you the ther case.

440
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:11,810
They are very sensitive individuals whose nervous system is in a state of…

441
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:32,960
The idea is because the nervous system is in a state of excitement

442
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:40,710
the noise feels as if it goes through the body.

443
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:46,700
That means there is a noise and they feel pain in the body.

444
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:56,200
That is the typical ther aggravation from noise. They feel so much the noise

445
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:04,720
as if something is passing through their body and leaves a pain in the body.

446
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:18,220
That is the ther sensitiveness to noise. So he does not have this kind of noise.

447
01:04:23,210 --> 01:04:27,310
So, acon, why not acon?

448
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:51,610
Acon is a remedy which can start a state, a pathology after the life has been threatened.

449
01:04:51,710 --> 01:05:07,100
After somebody has threatened the individual “I will kill you. Give me your purse. Give me your money.

450
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,710
Give me your money quickly…”

451
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:25,290
That state can create such a deep fear that never leaves the individual

452
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:50,120
but what is the pathology that would develop in a kind of acon? What is the pathology?

453
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:57,960
You have to see the peculiarities of the remedies,

454
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:08,950
you have to see the organism went towards the acon state or in other state?

455
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:13,270
He had a shock that’s true.

456
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:24,740
If the shock went towards the acon state what we would have observed in him?

457
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:31,120
– Panic.
– Panic. Panic attacks.

458
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:53,030
That means in such cases the shock stimulates a part of the brain

459
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:59,120
which concerns itself with protection.

460
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:09,030
We have some mechanisms that say “here is a danger! Do this, do that”

461
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:17,030
There is a portion in the brain, there is an area in the brain which concerns our protection,

462
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:20,460
how to protect ourselves in a case of danger.

463
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:27,930
Now, in case the danger is fatal, that means I am going to die,

464
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:37,900
like in an earthquake or with the pistol, then this area is like a wound.

465
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:54,360
It remains in the brain like a wound which is stimulated every time there is a similar situation.

466
01:07:55,340 --> 01:08:05,620
If the person finds itself in a kind of a similar situation the brain remembers it

467
01:08:09,049 --> 01:08:18,847
It’s like opening that wound and then the panic attack comes.

468
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:32,436
If somebody has started panic attacks when he entered a lift and the lift stopped in the middle of nowhere

469
01:08:32,694 --> 01:08:47,030
and became enclosed and the fear that “Now I’m going to die because I cannot call, I cannot find a way out etc.”

470
01:08:48,543 --> 01:09:04,311
The moment he gets the shock, they come out; they take him out eventually, every time he goes into a lift, the panic starts.

471
01:09:04,796 --> 01:09:17,419
Therefore, he will avoid the lifts, but sometimes he will go to places where he will think “Now I’m enclosed, I cannot get out”.

472
01:09:18,222 --> 01:09:29,959
Then it’s a similar situation, that situation will bring about the panic attack.

473
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:40,614
Because he simulates the condition under which his life was threatened, in the same way.

474
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:49,533
Therefore, for Aconite, which has a strong fear of dying…

475
01:09:53,488 --> 01:10:03,385
Ok, I’ll tell you something. If the shock is for Aconite, the fear of dying must be there.

476
01:10:03,852 --> 01:10:10,828
That means “I’m going to die right now”, that means a panic attack, which is not the case.

477
01:10:12,323 --> 01:10:17,583
and this is how you should answer me as good students you are.

478
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:34,153
This is how you answer me why not acon. Now slowly I’ll bring you to the solution of the case.

479
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,490
What about rhus-t?

480
01:10:43,240 --> 01:11:23,310
He is cold, he is restless, likes gym, likes movement, motion… You are always asking questions.

481
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:27,360
- He said that he doesn’t like milk.
- Yes, that’s very good.

482
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:42,260
That’s why I asked him “You like milk?” He said no. Rhus-t is very much fond of milk.

483
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:50,570
They can drink 3 kilos milk a day. If you let them they will drink and drink a lot.

484
01:11:50,670 --> 01:12:08,910
So this is one thing. The other thing is that… Now you tell me what is against rhus-t?

485
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:29,390
I’m not going to say everything myself. He wants cold drinks, ok that’s also a little bit…

486
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:38,410
In the morning he said “I feel tired but as soon as I get up I feel good.

487
01:12:38,510 --> 01:12:45,480
It is not that after moving for ten minutes, then I feel good.”

488
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:53,150
He feels immediately, that is not rhus-t. Rhus-t wakes up in a stiff condition.

489
01:12:55,170 --> 01:13:02,740
The cervical region, the back, the legs they are stiff.

490
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:19,260
He has to move for half an hour and then becomes better. But I forgot to get a point about rhus-t.

491
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,650
The way he sleeps.

492
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:32,410
He says “before I sleep I turn. If I sleep in the back I find myself always in the back.

493
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:39,640
That means during sleep there is no restlessness. He stays right there.

494
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:49,890
That is not good for rhus-t, if you want to give rhus-t. Rhus-t is restless during sleep as well.

495
01:13:49,990 --> 01:14:09,410
This is the kind of surgical analysis of the case in order to come closer to the right remedy.

496
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:21,420
What about phos?

497
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:38,830
Phos he said it was the only remedy that affected him but was given again and again without effect.

498
01:14:39,340 --> 01:15:04,360
So how come and why? The reason is that most probably phos is the second remedy.

499
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:09,560
His first remedy has not been found.

500
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:18,040
His second remedy which is underneath is phos but not a complete phos yet.

501
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:27,650
We need to give the first remedy to take out the first layer and then the phos becomes more clear

502
01:15:27,750 --> 01:15:48,490
and then we’ll have a deeper effect. You are not impressed.

503
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:59,480
George talks whatever he likes, like this… No, I’m thinking all this time for everything.

504
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:10,030
I’m trying to reconstruct now. But one thing nobody asked me, why I ask…

505
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:27,410
- No she is not allowed to talk. If I know she knows, she’s not allowed to talk.

506
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:34,910
- I was wondering why you asked about the animals?

507
01:16:35,010 --> 01:16:40,410
You asked him “Would you cry if a fly was killed”

508
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:53,080
- That was for phos. To confirm the sensitivity of the phos. Sympathetic. Not carc.

509
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:15,090
Let me see if you will find. Why I asked about the coffee.

510
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:27,320
You were not impressed that I asked about the coffee.

511
01:17:30,990 --> 01:17:40,880
I ask something that should have impressed; why the hell George asked this question?

512
01:17:56,740 --> 01:18:01,640
- You asked him if he sighs a lot. And he said no.

513
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:14,130
- He does a bit. He says sometimes. No, the impressive question was…

514
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:18,640
- You asked him if he is weeping when he is thanked.

515
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:22,740
- Yes. No.

516
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:32,140
- You asked about conscious…

517
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:37,640
- Yeees! Which country you come from?

518
01:18:37,740 --> 01:18:42,660
- I’m French but I’m here with the English group.

519
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:54,160
- This is the question. What was the reason why I asked him about his conscience?

520
01:18:54,260 --> 01:19:00,410
Why I asked him how he feels about his conscience?

521
01:19:00,510 --> 01:19:17,020
He has something that bothers his conscience. Why? Nobody asked this question.

522
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:29,660
How come that I reached after a lot of questions I have asked,

523
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:36,580
I reached the state where I thought most probably

524
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:51,080
there is something bothering deeply in his conscience which does not allow him to let it

525
01:19:51,180 --> 01:20:03,600
and go deep into sleep. Very simple.

526
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:21,180
And he was quite brave actually, I mean you will not get a lot of guys that will confess what he said.

527
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:28,110
But why he did it? You know what he thought by the moment he said it.

528
01:20:28,850 --> 01:20:43,270
Because you remember he stopped for a while, he thought and I was quiet not by chance.

529
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:56,570
I was quiet for a reason, because I could see his reaction. There was right, the question.

530
01:20:56,670 --> 01:21:03,910
What I was waiting? I didn’t want to bring him into a difficult situation

531
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:15,820
where I would ask him to tell us and then you remember he told us “Do you want me to tell you?”

532
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:28,980
I waited to see whether there was such a need from inside. It’s not typical and it’s not easy.

533
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:40,830
This kind of taking of the case is not easy at all to undress such a person.

534
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:56,100
And I usually do not intrude but I have to know what is useful for me to know to find the remedy.

535
01:21:57,090 --> 01:22:01,500
And to differentiate between the one remedy and the other.

536
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:08,210
Because you can see 20 remedies have been given, correct?

537
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:15,150
All these remedies are having a basis, that means the one

538
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:30,750
who was prescribing was a good homeopath. But he was prescribing near, not exact.

539
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:46,260
The homeopath which prescribed is here? Anyhow it doesn’t matter.

540
01:22:50,420 --> 01:23:00,560
So in the end of the story is that then I come to the realization there is something

541
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:12,170
which is deep bothering him, does not allow him to rest, to have real peace inside

542
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:23,490
because “there is something which I have done very bad, why did I do it, I was very stupid…”

543
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:31,340
But this does not appear as a logical argument within himself.

544
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:41,080
It appears as a subconscious problem that is there as a background.

545
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:44,730
He is not arguing with himself,

546
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:57,020
his conscience is now on a background making comments about him, what he did.

547
01:23:57,740 --> 01:24:06,250
Not logically. It’s a background noise, it’s a noise and this noise does not allow.

548
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:20,660
It’s under an overexcitement of the nervous system which has remained open.

549
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:28,670
Now, I’ll bring you back to the idea of acon. I’ll tell you acon or op. How they will react.

550
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:33,890
Acon will have panic attacks, op will have sleepiness etc.

551
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:46,310
I come back now and I ask a question and I say “When I see that there is a stress, shock

552
01:24:46,410 --> 01:25:02,530
and the shock does not go to this area in the brain, but what produces is sleeplessness,

553
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:13,550
is the main problem, when the shock with the overexcitement produces sleeplessness.

554
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:28,220
I got a fright and as a result I got sleeplessness. Which can be the remedy for this?

555
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:44,060
Show me the symptoms. Ok he has put 20 symptoms, how many? 20, ok.

556
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:49,860
Fear of being alone in the night, fear of snakes, tossing about in bed, weeping when alone,

557
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:55,350
weeping from joy, agglutinated at night, eyes.

558
01:25:55,450 --> 01:26:10,620
He put all the symptoms in this bloody computer which sometimes imitates my mind.

559
01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:33,350
Now show me the VES. Which is the remedy? Coff is the remedy which is needed.

560
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:48,360
Wow! I don’t say it myself only, this bloody thing is saying the same thing, right?

561
01:26:52,110 --> 01:27:04,290
Show me now out of 20 symptoms how many symptoms are covered? Only 8 symptoms yet.

562
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:12,100
This says the remedy you have to consider is coff.

563
01:27:15,030 --> 01:27:22,940
Coff in line how many symptoms it covers?

564
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:35,090
Tossing about in bed, weeping from joy, coryza in cold air aggravates, constriction in the rectum,

565
01:27:35,190 --> 01:27:44,340
sleeplessness from abuse of coffee, waking from slightest noise, air draft aggravates

566
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:46,260
and cold aggravates.

567
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:56,750
I want to show where is standing in the flat repertorization something very interesting.

568
01:27:57,250 --> 01:28:03,020
Ign is for flat repertorization. Nat-m, lyc…

569
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:21,490
Where is coff? Number 14. Ign, lyc, nat-m, sulph, ars, calc, phos, sep, chin

570
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:25,040
and all the rest… number 14.

571
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:41,670
But the VES says, watch out because this guy has some keynotes of coff.

572
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:53,410
When he’s nervous system was agitated by shock, the result was sleeplessness.

573
01:28:56,580 --> 01:29:09,080
And he says if somebody thanks me… Coff is very excitable, they can cry with thanking them.

574
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:20,250
He said quite a lot and he said “I never took coffee. Because if I drink one cup of coffee…

575
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:25,070
I drank once 20 years ago and I couldn’t sleep the whole night.

576
01:29:25,170 --> 01:29:34,260
See how sensitive is with the coff. Show me the symptom, aggravation from coffee.

577
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:49,090
The use of coffee aggravates, brings sleeplessness. Cham, nux-v and coff.

578
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:59,170
Nux-v was given for the same reason but this coff what will do?

579
01:30:01,670 --> 01:30:08,340
It will cover the first layer not the whole of the case.

580
01:30:08,830 --> 01:30:15,780
It will put him to sleep maybe we take a coff and maybe he sleeps for 3 days,

581
01:30:16,270 --> 01:30:19,750
he will be very happy, I don’t believe but anyhow.

582
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:29,500
The coff will take out the upper layer and then underneath will come up.

583
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:39,530
Either the Ign if he has held inside grief or right away phos.

584
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:49,750
This is how a homeopathic analysis should be done to find the remedy.

585
01:30:52,000 --> 01:31:00,260
Difficult case for students and for me as well, for teachers also.

586
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:04,350
So I was struggling quite a lot.

587
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:14,990
By putting away not this not that… you end up with the best possibility

588
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:21,660
and then suddenly I was confirmed.

589
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:35,860
I’l give you now the remedy, the coff, the potency that he must take for coff.

590
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:42,520
What is your idea? I just want to know.

591
01:31:42,620 --> 01:32:01,680
Who will prescribe let us say CM? 50M? 10M? 1M? 200CH? 30CH?

592
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:09,590
The most it was between 200CH and 1M. He needs a very high potency.

593
01:32:10,080 --> 01:32:34,570
He needs a 50M potency. It will take him 3 days to sleep. 3 days. 50M.

594
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:38,490
He needs a high potency because it was a stress

595
01:32:38,590 --> 01:32:47,820
that brought about this stress in the nervous system.

596
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:30,850
- Come I want to give a follow up on your case. Coff. What happened?

597
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:36,680
- Maybe a few hours after I took coff there was a pain in my right testicle

598
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:46,160
and for maybe 10 years ago I had a kick at this place

599
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:54,040
and it didn’t feel so good for a couple of days, by that time.

600
01:33:54,530 --> 01:33:58,420
- And you had a return of this pain after?

601
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:07,670
- Not until now, no.
- Now after coff… you have a return.

602
01:34:07,770 --> 01:34:18,180
- Also today but it goes a little bit. And yesterday evening,

603
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:25,150
I’m not sure if it was the coff or if it was the wine, I never drink wine,

604
01:34:25,250 --> 01:34:30,150
I’m sensitive to wine I think, but maybe it was the coff picture also.

605
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:37,910
I drank half a glass of wine and fell asleep maybe after 20-30 minutes

606
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:41,970
and I slept really good for 5 hours.

607
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:50,830
And then a bird above me at the same time every morning at 6 o’clock

608
01:34:50,930 --> 01:34:53,280
- Same bloody bird.

609
01:34:57,250 --> 01:35:03,400
- But I could fall asleep again. I couldn’t the other days.

610
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:14,740
- So the wine did a good job!
- Yes.

611
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:23,930
- Any change in your psychology?
- I’m not sure.

612
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:35,440
- Ok, we’ll see. Ok, thank you. For the sake of the class.

613
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:46,600
You see I didn’t want to say yesterday that he will go into a comatose state of sleep.

614
01:35:51,330 --> 01:36:00,320
After seducing the excitement of the nervous system how long it will continue

615
01:36:00,420 --> 01:36:03,670
and when the next remedy will be ready.
