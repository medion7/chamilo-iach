1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:21,090
To talk to you about the levels of health and to give you some ideas

2
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,430
about what they mean.

3
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:45,340
Why I came to the conclusion that the whole of humanity belongs not to one level of health

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,930
but to several levels of health.

5
00:00:49,920 --> 00:01:06,090
So the whole of humanity is divided symbolically not exactly into 12 levels of health.

6
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:20,830
So according to my understanding a person is born in the 1st level of health

7
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:27,750
the uppermost which is the best and some others unfortunate

8
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:35,590
have been born in the 12th level of health, which is the worst.

9
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:50,570
In the 12th level of health who belong? Belong all these children who are born with cancer,

10
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:58,740
with severe systemic disorders, with epilepsy, with autism etc.

11
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:10,250
Once is born with such a pathology belongs to the 12th level of health,

12
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:23,760
to very low level of health. And you may ask what do we need to know

13
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,490
which level of health somebody is...

14
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:38,320
Well, it's very important to know because if we have a case

15
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:46,960
that belongs to level 10,11, 12 which is the last group

16
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:57,090
that means we have in our hands a case that most probably is incurable with Homeopathy.

17
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:14,660
As we go higher in the levels of health then individuals who are chronically ill

18
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:25,860
with degenerative diseases will not respond to one remedy.

19
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:35,520
You may need a series of remedies before you can bring them higher and higher

20
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,640
in the level of health.

21
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:57,240
Therefore severely damaged constitutions they will respond partially to your first remedy

22
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:05,930
then the picture of another remedy manifests you give this comes up the organism a bit more,

23
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:18,110
a third remedy, a forth remedy  you may need before within a space of time 3-5 years

24
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:28,260
of treatment then you may say I have managed to cure such a person.

25
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:49,150
The problem with us homeopaths is that some people some of us we see cases

26
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:59,240
responding very well with one remedy and the confusion is that we get the impression

27
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:08,250
that all cases could respond in this way to the extent

28
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:20,160
for instance one of the Argentinian doctors you have to find the core remedy,

29
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,160
everybody has the core remedy.

30
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:34,500
This does not exist, because if an individual is going to be cured with one 1-5 remedies

31
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:42,710
in a space of time of 3-5 years, then you cannot say the core remedy,

32
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,990
out of the five which was the core remedy...?

33
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:59,510
But if you find patients that belong to the uppermost levels 1,2,3 strong constitutions

34
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:10,080
born with genetic predisposition to live for 90 years, then to such individuals

35
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:15,850
you may give one remedy and they respond beautifully.

36
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:25,580
But you can imagine now the confusion that we can cause to the world by saying

37
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,330
we cure this whatever pathology, because we have seen one or two cases cured.

38
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:43,100
Because they belong to the first group. But what is the peculiarity

39
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,060
and why this confusion has come?

40
00:06:49,620 --> 00:07:07,760
Because in all levels we may have the manifestation of all pathologies.

41
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:19,890
That means we have a cancer case appearing in level 1-3, the best,

42
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,320
which we call the first group, which is the best group.

43
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:31,650
We may have manifestation in first group.

44
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:44,840
We have manifestation of cancer in group 2 which is level 4,5 and 6.

45
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:52,330
We may have cancer manifesting in group 3 7,8,9.

46
00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:05,740
So what is the difference? The difference is that cancer on the 1st group is curable.

47
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:16,050
Cancer on level 1,2,3 individuals is curable. And we have seen some cases of cancer cured,

48
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,660
"oh we cure cancer...".

49
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:30,860
We don't cure cancer because cancer on level 7,8,9 if it manifests

50
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:42,220
that means it will be an aggressive type of cancer that will be exploding

51
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:52,220
that means within months you will have metastasis and the person dies.

52
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,320
And nothing can save him, not homeopathy not allopathy, nothing.

53
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:13,990
But cancer on the uppermost levels even can be cured as when the individual

54
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:26,660
changes his psychology and his immune system is activated. Why?

55
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:35,630
Because he realizes the life I'm living is very unhealthy.

56
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:40,490
So I change altogether my style of life.

57
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:53,070
The moment they take this decision to go away from the stress of life, which is tremendous...

58
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:13,670
The cases I am bringing as examples are real cases. Working emigrated in USA

59
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:24,160
and became rich with a lot of supermarkets and all this kind of stress.

60
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:35,400
And at the age of 60 go to the doctor say "I have bad news for you sir.

61
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:50,890
You have cancer on the mediastinum and the prognosis is quite bad".

62
00:10:52,640 --> 00:11:03,400
He goes back, has his family there, he says "How long I have to live?

63
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:19,130
-You may live 6 months...more...". He said "Ok, 6 months I want to go back to my island

64
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:25,390
to live 6 months there. My last days...".

65
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:35,060
He was given now an interview to Greek television.

66
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:51,470
He says "In 1985 I came here, now it's 2005, 20 years later he is 79,

67
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,110
because they told me I have 6 months to live."

68
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:01,680
Go to  another individual who is the case..." I was told to  live this, this...

69
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:10,680
I came back here and here I am 15 years later, I am quite strong, my life has changed..."

70
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:30,720
So, we have to understand that the secret is that the organism has a defense mechanism.

71
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:42,860
We call it immune system which is being suppressed, until compromises

72
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:52,080
and the predispositions that are engrafted are manifesting suddenly.

73
00:12:52,180 --> 00:13:00,590
If the predisposition was for rheumatoid arthritis he will develop rheumatoid arthritis.

74
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:11,330
One guy, he wrote a book in America. He wrote a book, he says "I had rheumatoid arthritis.

75
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:24,240
I was an industrialist with huge money etc. and they told me I'm going to be deformed now.

76
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:38,160
So, I gave up my job and what I did I started laughing. Here I am 10 years later

77
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:48,010
I am still laughing, not deformities and I am quite good because I was laughing.

78
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,670
You see we have to take into consideration this. I tell you this

79
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:06,150
because it is very much connected with what we are doing in stimulating the immune system

80
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:14,830
with the homeopathic remedy.  Similar things happen when you change the psychology,

81
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:23,630
the environment, the conditions. The organism suddenly flourishes,

82
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:29,850
the immune systems comes into balance and then faces the problem.

83
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:46,740
But you will say if somebody has a strong constitution and belongs to the uppermost group

84
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:53,170
how come and he can develop cancer from one day to another?

85
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:12,740
The answer is that if the stress they receive overweights the resistance of the immune system,

86
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:23,680
the stress is very big, the immune system compromises totally then it can appear.

87
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:35,470
I will give you an example from real life. I was teaching in Athens a group of medical doctors.

88
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:46,550
One of the doctors works in a hospital, chest hospital. He brings a case for discussion.

89
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,510
What is the remedy, because we have a case in the hospital

90
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,490
and who is coughing, coughing, coughing.

91
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:12,220
And these are the symptoms of the persons the man is 75, 73. Old man.

92
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:27,720
Older than me I am only 78 now. But anyhow, the fact is that he brings me the case,

93
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:38,130
he gives me the information, he is coughing and I say to him "Peter,

94
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:50,800
what happened and he suddenly a man who is a villager, a farmer in a small place in Greece

95
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:58,820
where people are healthy... What happened? Why? Something has happened."

96
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:17,060
He said this man had an illegal affair - he was married and he has grandchildren -

97
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:25,680
with a woman from the area who is also married with some children.

98
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:38,710
Suddenly this becomes known to the whole of the village and the stress of this man

99
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:49,410
is so great that he does not know anymore where to hide himself from everybody gossiping.

100
00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:02,660
He was discovered suddenly to have this illegal affair. The shock for him is tremendous.

101
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:17,240
So, I said "Peter, you have to be careful because this is a case of cancer",

102
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,160
he says "Why do you say that?",

103
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:32,810
I said "Because the stress for such a man at this age and the symptomatology coughing

104
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,510
this means he has developed cancer of the lungs".

105
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:52,980
The fact is that my student has brought this case to me to check me

106
00:18:53,080 --> 00:19:02,630
because I would say "Give Sulphur" and then he would go to the next room

107
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:11,490
where he left his bag with the x-rays and he would say "Teacher it was a case of cancer

108
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:17,230
and you did not recognize it. You are treating it as a common cough.

109
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:27,730
But he opened the mouth like that and he said "Why?" and I explained why I said that.

110
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,390
Don't cough and give me the idea that...

111
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,270
Why I was able to make a correct diagnosis?

112
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:57,930
Because I knew what I am trying to pass you as information right now.

113
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:04,620
That is does not matter how healthy an individual can be.

114
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:14,690
Once the the stress is great the manifestation of a severe degenerative condition

115
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:26,180
may manifest from one day to the other. But what is the difference?

116
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:37,460
That his cancer was cured. Because he presented a case of clear Sulphur.

117
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:47,160
And his case was curable because if the same thing was happening

118
00:20:47,260 --> 00:21:00,430
in an individual of group 7,8,9 lower groups then by the time we were talking

119
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:13,020
he would already have a metastasis. So another example, I will give you.

120
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:32,860
Here where I live I had an old man about 70-72 he was my gardener I had noticed

121
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:42,850
that he had Parkinson because as soon as he got excited he would go like this,

122
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,430
his hands would go like that.

123
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:59,180
One day he comes and tells me "I hurt my finger. Can you give me a remedy for my finger?"

124
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:03,580
and I said "Ok, I will give you a remedy for the finger".

125
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:12,940
But he is farmer he doesn't pay attention. Everybody accepts, he's an old man...

126
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,590
What to ask...

127
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:29,680
But I had noticed that every time the man was coming he was so dirty in his clothes.

128
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:37,180
Sometimes I thought he had urinated his pants and he didn't care.

129
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:50,820
So I said ok this is a case of Sulphur. Because I knew certain other things for instance

130
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:58,500
he would eat the sweets and every time he would ask for tsipouro, tequila.

131
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:07,250
He needed some tequila, he eats sweets, he was dirty.

132
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:21,740
This is characteristic of Sulphur.  The lower jaw it goes like that. I didn't ask a question.

133
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:28,070
I'll give a remedy for your finger. I gave him Sulphur 200.

134
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:39,180
And within one week he comes and I see for the first time he has washed his clothes,

135
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,170
he comes and he is with clean clothes...

136
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:02,230
Now, a German television comes here and come to my house to show to the German people

137
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,670
George Vithoulkas what is doing and all that.

138
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:11,590
And there is my gardener and I tell them the story of the gardener,

139
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:27,250
and they see the gardener etc... This documentary was played in Germany 7 times.

140
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:35,270
Every time it was played I was receiving thousands of letters from Parkinson people

141
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,090
asking for treatment.

142
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:52,430
Of course some of them may belong to the group 1, but who? All the others... forget it.

143
00:24:52,530 --> 00:25:00,010
We may improve a little bit but forget the cure of such people.

144
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:12,280
So the idea of the levels of health it became for me very important

145
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:23,930
and when I wrote my book "The Science of Homeopathy"- I wrote the book in 1976

146
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:30,600
and two years after it was published 1978 -

147
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:38,020
I put this idea of the levels of health without giving more information

148
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:52,020
because before I say something I want to be sure that it is so...

149
00:25:52,120 --> 00:26:01,200
And only in 1995 when this school was established here I started giving the information

150
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:11,220
about the levels of health because there are some characteristics

151
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,240
about these levels of health.

152
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:34,800
Which are the characteristics? As you go down the scale and the pathology

153
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:44,150
becomes deeper and more serious you will have to lower the potency.

154
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:53,640
That means in the highest groups you can give high potencies,

155
00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:01,910
no problem 1M, 10M, 50M, no problem.

156
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:10,800
But as the pathology becomes more and more you have to lower the potency.

157
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:22,440
You go to 200, you go to 30, you go to 12, you go even lower than 12, 12X

158
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:33,810
and when in the uppermost group one high potency may be enough in the lower groups

159
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,410
you have to repeat.

160
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:47,050
There is so much confusion if you do not understand these levels of health.

161
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:58,320
So much confusion about such low/ high potencies, repetitions etc.

162
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:09,640
Because some homeopaths have noticed that if I repeat the case goes very well

163
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:21,440
and then makes it a rule for every case.  What happens? Ok, I will explain it to you.

164
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,510
I may go to details but maybe it is important.

165
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:35,910
What happens is that when you give a remedy on higher groups

166
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:40,670
you give a shock to the immune system, you trigger the immune system

167
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:50,520
and after that the immune system comes back and starts doing the work, curing the person.

168
00:28:52,180 --> 00:29:02,070
Once you have power in the immune system you will not have to stimulate it again

169
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:13,240
because the moment you stimulated it already you changes the vibrational rate

170
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,280
of the immune system.

171
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,570
So when you repeat it later on, after a week or two weeks

172
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:30,740
the vibrational state of the immune system is not there. It has changed already.

173
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:38,620
But in case the immune system is very weak you have to stimulate it

174
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,930
again and again and again...

175
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,000
Strong immune system; you stimulate it once, you leave it,  you wait.

176
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:58,500
You can wait for 1 year and you will see the patient is doing better and better.

177
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:06,320
But you go down and you give one remedy and you see in one week

178
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,080
there is back everything.

179
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:15,670
In such cases you need repetition, constant repetition.

180
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:24,830
So you see how important it is to know what are you treating.

181
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,330
What is the pathology really behind.

182
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:51,030
Is it possible?  So, another thing that you have to pay attention is...

183
00:30:51,520 --> 00:31:06,150
You get a case with ulcerative colitis and you treat such case

184
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,910
and with one remedy the person comes back.

185
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:20,400
You have another case of ulcerative colitis and you need 3 years of correct treatment

186
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:33,510
before you can bring back such a case. So, what is the difference?

187
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:45,140
The difference is first on the genetic predisposition or there is another factor

188
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:59,860
which is how much a person who was born with genetic predisposition very high, very good,

189
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:10,100
how much he has damaged himself through wrong living, wrong medication,

190
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:21,350
a lot of medication, a lot of drugs, all kinds of drugs, alcohol too much, smoking a lot.

191
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:30,420
The level of such a person comes to a point when he comes to you

192
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:41,260
and says now he has arteritis because of too much smoke and drinking etc.

193
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:55,350
These cases that have been damaged through wrong living and wrong treatments

194
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:07,310
can respond much better than cases that genetically belong to low levels.

195
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:20,380
For instance, you will see children born with parents with very good health.

196
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:28,350
How old is your father? 85. How old is your father? 95.

197
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,720
And he is 65 and he has heart problem.

198
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:39,320
That means he has damaged his life because he comes with a very good predisposition

199
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,310
but does not pay attention to his own health.

200
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:52,970
Such persons he says "I had a heart infract or whatever damage in heart",

201
00:33:53,070 --> 00:34:00,330
such a person will respond very well to the treatment.

202
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:10,390
But if you have another person with the same symptomatology. Your when he died? 65.

203
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:13,390
From what? Heart infract. Your mother?

204
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:21,680
My mother was psychotic and she had to go to the asylum etc.

205
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:26,870
He comes to you with heart problems.

206
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:31,720
It's going to be very difficult to cure and it's going to take a long time

207
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,440
because the predisposition is bad.

208
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:48,310
In such cases you will have to struggle but is most important in which

209
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:57,220
nobody pays attention is that you have to find first the correct remedy,

210
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:05,320
you have to find the time for the second remedy, to give it in time correct again,

211
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,560
the third time to give it correct...

212
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:17,380
That means in such an individual you will have indication of 3 different remedies,

213
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,380
they pop up their symptoms. You will have to give Ignatia first,

214
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,680
but some symptoms of Sulphur are manifesting as well.

215
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:33,150
Is it Sulphur or Ignatia?

216
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:40,110
And you have to decide which is the first remedy that you must start the case

217
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:43,480
in order the case progresses properly.

218
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:50,800
Otherwise you give Sulphur which is second remedy, you give it as first,

219
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:57,680
you have partial results and then try to give another remedy Calcarea

220
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:03,730
and then another and another and then you have forgotten the picture of Ignatia in lost.

221
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,490
You don't have it anymore.

222
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:15,930
Then somebody else comes who is more expert and says "No, the first remedy is Ignatia.

223
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:22,470
Give Ignatia" and the case becomes coming in order.

224
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:32,160
And then the picture of Sulphur is manifesting. Give Sulphur now and then Calcarea.

225
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:41,070
I'll tell you now the big secret about these levels of health.

226
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,110
Now the big secret is coming.

227
00:36:47,580 --> 00:37:01,090
The peculiar thing is that in the uppermost level of health people can develop high fever.

228
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:16,460
Like most of the children. You see with tonsillitis, 40C, 39,5C... This is a good sign.

229
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,670
It's a sign the immune system is working properly.

230
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:28,460
Now what happens with mostly Western population, with Europeans,

231
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:37,740
with Americans with Canadians and this degenerated group of people.

232
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:44,800
Spain is also within this group. What happens?

233
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:55,210
Once a degenerative chronic condition begins there in no possibility for the organism

234
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:59,820
to develop a high fever.

235
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:13,300
So when you have a case in front of you and ask "when did you have your last high fever?

236
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,320
-I don't remember...maybe 10-12 years ago".

237
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:25,320
That was the time when his chronic condition has started.

238
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:40,960
Because once the chronic condition crosses and threshold after that the organism,

239
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:48,710
the immune system is busy with keeping up a balance.

240
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:54,210
He does not care about microbes, viruses.

241
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:08,240
That is why you will see in the flu epidemics who is getting the high fever?

242
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:19,080
Only the strong organisms. Those with degeneration they are protected.

243
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:30,990
Even if they do whatever to get high fever it's not possible for them.

244
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:46,140
So therefore in epidemic in 1950, 100 years ago almost, with the Spanish flu,

245
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:53,900
where there supposed to be 20.000.000 people dead, pandemic.

246
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:03,730
They show in the end that only the young and the strong where infected.

247
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:09,740
It's recorded in all scientific books.

248
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:17,080
The old and the infirmary, those who were suffering, they were spared.

249
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:27,950
This model explains why such thing happened.

250
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:41,810
And the conventional medicine do not still understand this very simple truth

251
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:52,450
and they say those who are in danger are those who are suffering

252
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,100
and you have to be vaccinated.

253
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:03,810
This means I am already very bad and I am vaccinated and I go to hell...

254
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:10,020
Because if such people are vaccinated they're going definitely

255
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,420
to have side-effects from vaccination.

256
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:22,190
Because you force upon the organism something which is foreign. You see the madness.

257
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:42,780
An individual is having a heart problem but his immune condition and belongs to group 3.

258
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:55,170
He is in danger of getting high fever with his heart in a bad condition.

259
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:03,530
You see the explanation how clear it is.
