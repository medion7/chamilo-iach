1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:23,130
So this lady comes from the USA and she knows homeopathy, you're a homeopath yourself

2
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,380
and most probably you have taken a lot of remedies.

3
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,820
- And probably proved them. I'm very sensitive to the remedies.

4
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,390
-But I see in your reports not the remedies that you have taken.

5
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:54,060
-They were probably too many...
-I need to know.

6
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:01,460
-The first remedy that I took was sep and that was when my son was born about 20 years ago.

7
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:10,310
I had postpartum depression. And doctor Karim gave me that 1M.

8
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,910
-The Pakistani?
-Yes he is living now in Connecticut.

9
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:26,570
That's the first homeopath I saw. He gave me 1M and started laughing hysterically.

10
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,650
I was embarrassed.

11
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,710
- After the remedy?

12
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:38,380
-Yes and that went on for a while and then I moved to California

13
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,880
so I had to see another homeopath and she gave me different remedies...

14
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,220
- Who is she?
- She teaches...

15
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,220
- She gave mixtures of remedies?
- She gave me a few.

16
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:05,020
Gosh I can't remember what they were. Arg-n I think was one of them. It was a long time ago.

17
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,270
- Ok. Then?

18
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:13,880
- I have taken a lot myself and I know I am not supposed to. I can't figure it out.

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:23,010
So I've taken sulph and sep, puls, arg-n, ars...

20
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,030
- Phos?
- I haven't taken phos.

21
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:37,030
Puls I have taken seemed to stop the moodiness and weepiness that I have.

22
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,190
- Nat-m?

23
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:50,690
- Nat-m no... Maybe once or twice, that's hard to say. I've taken quite a few.

24
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,930
- Ign? You took several times?
- A couple of times, yes.

25
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:05,610
When my dad was real ill and go to see every time I leaved I cried. That was quite a few years ago.

26
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,770
- And calc?
- No.

27
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,760
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

28
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,630
- Sil?
- No.

29
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,250
- We'll see. We'll find out.

30
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:31,100
So you write here in your report that you were depressed since 6 years old.

31
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,840
As far as you can remember yourself. Because your mother separated

32
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:47,450
and you were around 4 years old then. Your dad was an alcoholic.

33
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,330
Your dad had indian blood?
- Yes.

34
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,350
- He was pure Indian? 
- No.

35
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,020
- He was a mixture.
- French and Indian.

36
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:09,920
- And used to beat your mother. Had anal fissures.

37
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:20,270
Who? You or the father?
- Me.

38
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:28,170
- And were hospitalized about 3 times. When you were 3 years old.

39
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:38,190
- Yes 3 years old or somewhere in there. And then I had tonsillitis and they removed my tonsils.

40
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,690
- Removed your tonsils at the age of 5.

41
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,020
- Somewhere there. As far as I can remember.

42
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:58,780
- What you would say it is your main problem now?
- Very aggressive, anger?

43
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,920
- You have kept anger inside. You have never taken staph?

44
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,170
- I have.

45
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,930
- And several times?
- Staph not several times, no.

46
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:24,690
I really hate rudeness. I will be rude sometimes but I don't tolerate people who are rude.

47
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:35,600
I'll let you know. And very argumentative, very aggressive, irritable a lot.

48
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:44,600
I will argue with you and you can't control me. You cannot tell me what to do.

49
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,610
- That is a problem in your life, I believe.

50
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:56,750
Socially you have problems by letting yourself, expressing what you think about the other person

51
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:05,510
or political situations? Politically are you an anarchist?

52
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,470
-  I don't care about politics.

53
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,110
- You don't care about politics like all Americans.

54
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:20,110
- As you know we get into and half of the time it doesn't work.  Just go with flow.

55
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:31,010
- But what I want to understand; if you are in an argument with somebody up to what extent...

56
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:44,510
- I'll rip your head off. When I get really angry I want to hit something.

57
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,050
I don't but that's what I say.

58
00:06:47,150 --> 00:07:00,500
- You want to do it. But when you feel this you cannot control at the moment yourself?

59
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:10,000
- Well, I hold it in but with maybe my partner I won't hold it in. I'll just let it happen.

60
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,510
- You let it out? Totally?

61
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:20,260
- Yes but I don't do that with people in general unless it's one of those days...

62
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,000
- You still have your menses?

63
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,600
- No I got through menopause. This is the second year.

64
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,920
- When you had your menses before menses it was terrible?

65
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,930
- Horrible.

66
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:40,270
- Anger and irritability...
- And very sad and very depressed.

67
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,010
- When the flow was coming...
- Lach didn't work either.

68
00:07:50,520 --> 00:08:01,340
Actually made me a paranoid. High potency. It made me feel people are following me.

69
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,330
So I had to take me off that one.

70
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:11,680
That's more of a left sided remedy and most of my symptoms are on the right. But we did try that one.

71
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:26,000
- But still I want to understand a little bit more your inner state.

72
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:41,330
Do you feel that you have such anger that with the least provocation you would kill that person?

73
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,090
- Not kill, just smack them.

74
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,740
- Why do I ask this question? For which remedy?

75
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,340
- I have to think about that for minute. I know kill is more...

76
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,480
- Ok forget it. 
- I'll think about it later though.

77
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:12,340
- What about merc? Have you taken merc?
- No.

78
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,660
- You salivate during sleep?

79
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,910
There is any salivation.
- No.

80
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,160
- Bad mouth? Bad odor?

81
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,400
- Sure I have a little bad breath in the morning, yes.

82
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,660
- A bit.

83
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,260
- I haven't been told that, I don't think so.

84
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,920
- Have taken hyos?
- I have.

85
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,860
- Bell?
- I have not taken bell.

86
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,820
- Stram?
- Stram I have taken.

87
00:09:49,920 --> 00:10:00,680
As a matter of fact my son took it one time when I was in the room and I felt it I start laughing.

88
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,690
I have taken stram before and I could feel it.

89
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:16,320
- Which is good for you or? What was the effect of the stram or hyos...

90
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,820
- Stram was more fear of dark.

91
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,570
- You have still fear of dark?
- I still sleep with the light on.

92
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:38,240
And I think more for my parents and my dad being violent, I mean experience of violence.

93
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:44,820
- You had been the victim of violence?
- I just watched my dad beat my mom.

94
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:57,300
- And do you consider yourself as a violent person? You hit really, you kick gets?

95
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:07,410
- I've striked somebody before, boyfriend, twice.

96
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:13,050
- You seem proud of it.
- I'm not, no! But I did it.

97
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,650
- But afterwards you feel remorse?
- Yes of course.

98
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,570
- A lot of remorse?
- Yes.

99
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,490
And that's not something I've practiced, it's just how I felt at the time.

100
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,170
I don't like to be reprimanded. And I don't like to be told what to do.

101
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,030
- Have you taken nux-v of course?
- Yes.

102
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,430
- Carc?
- Nope.

103
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:59,180
- No carc? You feel very easily offended.

104
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:10,940
- Yes usually if people speak down to me or when many of them are rude

105
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,450
or mean to me I feel offended then yes.

106
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,680
- And then you respond?
- Sometimes.

107
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,200
- Aggressively?
- Yes.

108
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,930
- Abusively.
- Not abusively, more of lashing.

109
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:43,110
Just with my tongue. Very quirk, very sarcastic. Quick whip.

110
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:48,230
If I know that's going on with you and I am angry I can bring it out.

111
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,660
- And if you know the weak points of the other person,

112
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:02,640
for instance a man who is not much of a man, will you tell him?

113
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:10,250
- Yes. If I am in a relationship with him I will.

114
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:17,140
I wouldn't say it to you or to you but maybe after I knew you... Maybe.

115
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,440
But no, it's more in my relationships, yes.

116
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:36,170
- I brought it as an example, what I want to know is if you know the persons' weak spots

117
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:43,610
will you mention them immediately in case of controversy with them?

118
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,010
- If they've irritated me.

119
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,510
- You will.

120
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,360
- If they have irritated me and I am in that mood yes.

121
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,510
- Sexually you are active?
- Used to be very highly sexual.

122
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:10,380
Not as much anymore. I don't if it's just the partner or whatever but used to be very highly sexual.

123
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:19,030
- And you have taken plat?
- Yes. Sorry, I have taken quite a few.

124
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,490
- And orig?
- No.

125
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:54,600
In a hurry.  Everything I do it quickly. Work, eat, walk fast, impatient, I cannot wait for you,

126
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,200
hurry up, I've got things to do.

127
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:07,010
- Are you a kind of religious person?
- Yes, I would say.

128
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:21,870
I joined Jehovah's witnesses for a long time. And then I stopped. And now I am not doing anything.

129
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:31,340
- But during the lifetime when you were Jehovah's witness did you have a moral problem

130
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,430
between your behavior/ sexuality and your religion?

131
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,430
- No.

132
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,180
- There was not conflict in you.
- No.

133
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:51,530
I just did what was responsible and what was right, and no. I was married to a husband for 17 years.

134
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,760
- The first husband?
- I only had one.

135
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,110
- And what happened to him?
- I kicked him to the curb.

136
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:16,710
That was joke. I just left him because I wasn't happy, depressed.

137
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:22,440
- You told him to go or you left?
- I left.

138
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:30,550
- Because he cheated on you?
- He cheated on my probably 3 times.

139
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:35,980
And then at the end I cheated on him. Just to get out of the relationship.

140
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:44,310
- And finally you divorced? Officially?
- Yes.

141
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,790
- And now you are with a second man? You only had 2 men in your life?

142
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,050
- Third.

143
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,680
- Only 3 men in your life?
- Not in my life! No!

144
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:07,800
I got married 17 years and then I was with another man 6 years. And a lot of each cheated.

145
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,300
They cheated a lot. And then I have a lot of jealousy.

146
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,880
- You could not forgive them?
- No.

147
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:26,230
Kick them to the curb. Just it's another way to get rid of them.

148
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:38,610
I've a lot of jealousy. I procrastinate a lot. And I'm very good in business.

149
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,870
I'm very good with my patients and homeopathy and then I run an employment agency,

150
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,220
emplace people to work in dental field.

151
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:59,350
I've been doing that 23 years and that part I did really well, in business,

152
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:05,380
I don't do very well in relationships probably not so much in personal life.

153
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,540
- Do you want a change again?

154
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,040
- I just don't want them to get too close. I keep them at a distance.

155
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:28,800
And probably do that with arguing with them more. The argumentative and irritable.

156
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:36,690
- You can keep a tight cloth around your neck?

157
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:47,290
- I don't like that no. And I've done lach before.

158
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,970
- I don't ask it for lach.

159
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:03,530
- I have a big fear of a head-on collision with the car.

160
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,460
I don't like to drive on roads that are just 2-lane roads.

161
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:22,320
- But why you say that?
- Because I have a big fear of that.

162
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,460
- Because you have been in an accident.
- Yes.

163
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,570
- On a head-on collision in which you survived without problems.

164
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:49,990
- 2 really close head-on collisions. And then I have a fear of flying.

165
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:55,580
I don't like to fly in airplanes. Usually the landing part.

166
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:06,550
- You have received tarent?
- No. I have not.

167
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:20,060
And I love to dance. And then fear of abandonment but I push people away.

168
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,160
So I have that fear but I push people away.

169
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:40,160
- Due to your good character or bad character?
- Bad character.

170
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:47,160
- Do you really mean it or just say it.
- No, just verbally.

171
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,800
- That means you hurt them?
-  I argue with them and I say things that...

172
00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:01,150
It is more of an irritation, I'm just irritating, I get irritated and I don't want to deal with it.

173
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:22,560
When I am sick I hate to be questioned, I hate to be talked to and I hate to answer you.

174
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:28,020
In my emotional state if I am irritated I hate to be questioned.

175
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Don't ask me cause I don't want to tell you.

176
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:39,790
- But how do you deal now with my questions?
- Fine now.

177
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,710
- You were a little bit anxious, I tell you, you will forget about it.

178
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,540
- But that is with someone in a relationship again that is always irritating me.

179
00:21:53,210 --> 00:22:04,970
And I like to drink red wine, it makes me very argumentative. But that's what I prefer.

180
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:13,710
I can't stand the smell of cigarette smoke but I used to be a smoker many years ago.

181
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:20,370
- Heavy smoker?
- 2 packs a day.

182
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,110
- Hashish, marijuana?
- Yes.

183
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,600
- You tried a few times?
- Yes, quite a few drugs.

184
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,850
- Did you have extra-sensory perception?

185
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,270
Experiences of the beyond?
- No.

186
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:51,860
- You had bad experiences under drugs?
- Some, yes. Pot not so much.

187
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:56,860
I did cocaine and speed many years ago. Probably 25.

188
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:08,790
- LSD?
- Speed, it is amphetamine. 26 years ago.

189
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:16,850
- There was a time where you were in depression? You didn't want to work,

190
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:21,850
you didn't want to do anything...? When was that period?

191
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,600
- I still get like this sometimes.

192
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:31,100
- And how long it lasts?
- A long time and then I take a remedy...

193
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:42,950
Usually puls brings me out of that for some reason. Sexually abused at young age.

194
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:54,280
3 times just when I was younger. By babysitters, men.

195
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,530
- And you remember it?
- Yes I do.

196
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:07,020
I have gallstones, so I get the pain. It goes from here to my back.

197
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,010
I have a favorite word that I use a lot when I am aggravated, at somebody "you're exhausting".

198
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:20,110
I tell my daughter that, I tell them "you're exhausting", I feel exhausted by them.

199
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:27,690
- Your father is still alive?
- No, he died 3-4 years ago.

200
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,430
- Your mother?
- She's alive.

201
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,450
- How old is she?
- 72.

202
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:38,440
- Your father had problems with his liver?
- I am sure.

203
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:49,600
He had depression and he had anxiety attacks, had rheumatoid arthritis,

204
00:24:52,890 --> 00:25:06,770
had some heart issues at the end. But mainly the depression and the anxiety and the arthritis for him.

205
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:09,380
- Do you see dreams? Do you remember your dreams?

206
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,120
- I do.

207
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,590
- What is the theme mostly?
- I don't know.

208
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:20,340
They're crazy dreams, they don't have a theme. They can just be the craziest things.

209
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,600
I have to think about it. And I usually have more than one a night. I have quite a few.

210
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,090
- But in your dreams you are still arguing and quarrelling

211
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,190
and fighting like in your day time?
- No.

212
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,340
- What is the theme?
- I don't know.

213
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,860
I can't think of it. I haven't had any dreams in a while...

214
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:56,790
- When this feeling of anger comes inside do you feel a flush of blood in your head?

215
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:02,000
- No. I get angry and then I get sad.

216
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:13,260
- No, when you attack? When you respond? It is something... how comes?

217
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:21,110
- I usually feel it probably in my stomach and then in my heart.

218
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:29,530
I don't have a blood rush to my head. Stomach probably.

219
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,430
- Do you have any fears?
- I do.

220
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:44,670
I have the fear of a head-on collision, fear of dark, fear of landing in the airplane,

221
00:26:44,770 --> 00:27:03,180
fear of abandonment and the jealousy thing, I get really jealous if he looks at another pretty woman...

222
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:10,030
- Then you become really angry.
- Yes. I hold it in. I don't say it.

223
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,430
- For sometime.
- Yes.

224
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:27,780
Then I usually drink red wine, gets out. Sorry but it is true... Jealousy is really big for me.

225
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:46,530
And I've always had issues with my stomach. I always had stomachaches that's growing up.

226
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,290
- You have taken aur?
- No.

227
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,520
And I get stomachaches and lately heartburn when I get angry.

228
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:20,950
Or when I am irritated at the person I am with. And my eyes ache when I start to cry.

229
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:31,840
- Are you suspicious?
- I can be yes.

230
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,180
In the relationship... where you're  cheating... yes, sure.

231
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:55,100
- You said you had this amelioration with the flow?

232
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,930
When you had your menses, because you took lach.

233
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:08,250
- They gave me lach because of this talkativeness, used to be but not as much anymore

234
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:22,490
and the thing around the throat. Actually I believe doctor gave me that remedy.

235
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:28,350
He also gave me nat-m...

236
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,530
- Studying your case before we decide...
- I know.

237
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:51,830
- If you interfere with this you will give us wrong symptoms. Just give us real,

238
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:59,260
original symptoms without hiding. I see you can speak very freely actually.

239
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:07,170
You are not a simple case as you understand

240
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:15,510
and because you have taken all the remedies you have changed I little bit your profile.

241
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:24,690
I see you blushed now. Do you feel it?

242
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:30,000
- No I don't blush. I don't think so.

243
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,750
- I see the change.
- I'm blushing?

244
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:41,920
- You became reddish. You don't feel it.

245
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:50,920
- Genital herpes I got that when I was young.

246
00:30:54,410 --> 00:31:03,090
- Is not that I have to find your remedy. I have to justify the remedy, why I give the remedy.

247
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,340
That's why we study.
- No of course.

248
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,260
That's why I had to pull out the big guns.

249
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,420
I had to come here because nobody could figure me out.

250
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:30,230
Not as of today. So the biggest thing for me, my mental symptoms is I hate to be controlled,

251
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:39,350
I hate to be told what to do. I hate to deal with rude people.

252
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,750
I think those are my biggest mental symptoms for me and then of course the jealousy.

253
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:04,250
- How's your memory?
- Good.

254
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:16,270
- When you come to the depressive state, can you describe to me how you feel?

255
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,420
- I don't want to do anything. I just feel sad.

256
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:38,720
- And the tendency for crying comes then or indifference and apathy?

257
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,660
- More indifference.

258
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:55,720
- And how do you get out of that?
- I usually take puls.

259
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,050
- You take some homeopathic remedies.

260
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:08,650
And then you become overactive because of the way that you describe your life. It's very active.

261
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,400
- It's not as active as you think it is.

262
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:22,740
I run my business out of my home, the employment agency and that serve me well for my depression

263
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:30,380
and then of course I treat people off and on for a lot of years so mainly it's been more friends

264
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:39,480
and colleagues so far and now starting to treat people on more of a professional level

265
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,390
with a few other doctors.

266
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:43,800
- Where did you study homeopathy?

267
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:49,040
- A lot of it on my own, a lot of it from the internet,

268
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:57,570
studying through reading a lot of things from you as well, a lot of it just in my books...

269
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,640
- The fear of the dark is very strong?

270
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:17,640
That means if there is total darkness you will wake up in terror?

271
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:28,880
- No. Not too long ago I woke up and felt like somebody was standing by my bed and I screamed out.

272
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,990
And I used to have that long time ago I don't have so much anymore.

273
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:48,640
More of ghost, demons in the room. Yes, I like to keep a light on. I usually have the TV on.

274
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,650
So really late I finally turn it off.

275
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:11,480
- Are you taking the course?
- I am not but I'm going to be.

276
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,230
- When?

277
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:16,970
- You are in your 2nd period so I would have to start...

278
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,470
- No...

279
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:23,220
- e-learning?
- Yes, the e-learning.

280
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,500
- Not yet.

281
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,150
- So you are not aware of the theory that we have.

282
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,240
- No.

283
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:56,180
- Your previous life, your medical history... had fibroids when pregnant,

284
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:03,630
had gallbladder attacks, high blood pressure, constipation

285
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:13,710
and urinary tract infections after intercourse... What age you had your first sexual contact?

286
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:16,310
- 15.

287
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:22,960
- Did you have immediately an infection after that?

288
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,960
- No.

289
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,730
- But later on when you had...

290
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:45,210
- Yes the last 10 years. They have to be a lot of intercourse not just one time...

291
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:50,560
- You have to repeat. Don't speak so fast. Can you speak a little bit slower?

292
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:58,560
Because most of the people are not Americans here. So you said...

293
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:05,450
- After a lot of sexual intercourse I get urinary tract infections.

294
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:09,810
- Always?
- A lot of the times, yes.

295
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:20,560
- Your partner had gonorrhea in the past?
- No, I don't know.

296
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:25,460
- You had...
- Herpes, genital.

297
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,950
- Not venereal?

298
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,370
- Genital, venereal herpes, yes.

299
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:40,130
- I mean venereal diseases like syphilis, gonorrhea...

300
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:45,480
- I don't have that. And I don't know if somebody else in my past has.

301
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,390
-  Did you have med yourself?

302
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,070
- Yes.

303
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,830
- There was any effect?

304
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:03,310
- I don't remember. That was a long time ago. I don't recall.

305
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:17,060
- What else? Do you still have symptoms you did not mention so far?

306
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,830
- I don't think so.

307
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:24,450
- Why you are so nice with me?

308
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:33,050
- Because I like you! If you give me grief I may not be nice that's yet to bee seen.

309
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:38,300
- The way you describe yourself, I was afraid a little bit.

310
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,070
- Well I am really a nice person, for most part.

311
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:54,050
- But people of your own, you have the tendency to protect them?

312
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,390
- My children? Yes.

313
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:05,040
- You have a tendency "I am the boss. I will protect you..."

314
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:14,890
- Absolutely. You mess with my kids we're going to have issues.

315
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:28,380
- You have the American accent and though I've lived in America...

316
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,810
- We are not so bad!

317
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:42,200
- You speak a little bit fast which is difficult for the students as well to understand...

318
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,060
- I am sorry. It's part of the personality. It comes with the territory I suppose.

319
00:39:48,310 --> 00:40:02,560
- Can you give me an idea how many days you feel energetic and how many days in a year,

320
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:09,890
just give me a little idea, you feel depressed. Can you judge this?

321
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:21,390
- I would say more depressed and aggravated than up and energetic.

322
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:30,640
And when depressed I spend lot of time trying to sleep.

323
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:38,150
And now it's just more aggravated and irritated.

324
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:46,810
- But when you sleep you sleep right through the night? Or wake up.

325
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:48,790
- No. I wake up.

326
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:54,450
- And in the morning when you wake up you are refreshed or unrefreshed?

327
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:57,310
- Usually refreshed.

328
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:06,720
- What do you like to eat mostly? You have preferences?

329
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:21,820
- Cheese, I like cheese quite a bit. Warm drinks, not cold.

330
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,820
- You have taken phos?
- No.

331
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:39,950
- "I always want to be right and I cannot stand anyone to tell me what to do, argue with me"

332
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,210
- It's true!

333
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:51,280
- "When I drink too much I sob". I don't understand this.

334
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,550
- Cry.

335
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,870
- You mean alcohol?
- Yes.

336
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,210
- I thought water.

337
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:06,690
- No, alcohol. Usually red wine.

338
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:18,970
- Red wine makes you cry or makes you happy and out of happiness you cry?

339
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,550
- No, out of anger.

340
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,900
- So when you drink wine you become more angry?

341
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:45,240
- And aggressive and then sobbing. My skin itches when I'm in bed, everywhere.

342
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:52,390
- That's why you have taken sulph?
- Probably, one of the reasons yes.

343
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:59,460
- Did you say every in your list?
- Yes.

344
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,860
- You're checking your list now to see if you have said everything.

345
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,460
- Yes to see if I have missed anything.

346
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,720
I procrastinate on everything.

347
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:20,860
- You love to dance and you love thunderstorms.

348
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,850
- I love thunderstorms. Makes me excited.

349
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:31,450
- When did you take sep last time?
- The very first time I took a remedy.

350
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,760
- Again?
- Not after that.

351
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,770
- Never again?
- No.

352
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,770
- Why?

353
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:45,610
- I don't know. It was just never given to me again.

354
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,360
How about remedy for "talks too fast"?

355
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,650
- When you sleep you keep a position or you change?

356
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:17,230
- Right side. I prefer the right side when I'm sleeping but I toss and turn quite a bit.

357
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:21,840
I can't keep a position but right side preferably...

358
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,580
- Thank you.

359
00:44:53,490 --> 00:45:04,410
The pathology for this case is mostly on the mental emotional level

360
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:24,000
and if we want to put a name in the diagnosis we could say this is a manic depressive case.

361
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:37,900
I don't like putting labels in diseases because I know that all diseases

362
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:54,500
they have a kind of degree of intensity. So if we have in a certain so called disease with a name,

363
00:45:54,600 --> 00:46:10,990
several degrees of intensity in which degree we decide that now we can put this label,

364
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,370
this is the disease.

365
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:22,900
The diseases they have a starting point and then they develop and they go deeper and deeper.

366
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:37,750
And they become more and more severe. In her case actually if she is here can you ask her

367
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:42,900
when it was the last time she had a fever. Get her.

368
00:46:48,490 --> 00:47:00,720
I want to ask you a question. Do you remember if you had a high fever? 39C?

369
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,210
- I am sure I had.

370
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:08,710
- When?
- ...With tonsillitis.

371
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:14,970
- With tonsillitis? Can you tell me the age?

372
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:21,880
- Well I had tonsillitis a lot, like every year. 2 or 3 times a year.

373
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,630
And I am sure I had high fever with that.

374
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:28,380
- You do not measure it.
- I don't remember.

375
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:34,900
- When did you have your first tonsillitis. 
- 3 or 4.

376
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:50,140
- And then again you remember having tonsillitis and getting antibiotics every time?

377
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,570
- Every time, yes. And then I took them out.

378
00:47:55,810 --> 00:48:03,050
- What age they took it out?
- 5.

379
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:11,130
- 5, so early. So you could not have any more tonsillitis.

380
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:18,380
- Not after they removed but before. Lots. My tonsils were really swollen.

381
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,380
- Could not swallow.

382
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:29,320
- Yes. Sorry you guys. Bye!

383
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:32,820
- You did a good job. Bye.

384
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:50,810
She has very difficult temperament. Nice woman to have for how can I say for ping pong.

385
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:58,390
You say one word she says two and then three and four...

386
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:15,810
I am in a difficult position because I don't think anybody could have thought the remedy.

387
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:20,140
It's difficult the remedy.

388
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:33,560
Neither I have it here exactly but I will read to you the very close just to give you an idea.

389
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:49,730
From the Materia Medica Viva. "Strong personality that likes to be in the fore front.

390
00:49:52,480 --> 00:50:08,470
Is haughty and self-confident, feels important and is quite selfish.

391
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:28,490
They talk loudly indeed they talk a lot and many times will mumble and miss words."

392
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:35,480
Very interesting, mumble. Like Lach.

393
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:51,460
It's interesting if you hear a little bit more because once you grasp the idea you never forget.

394
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:58,800
This type of cases are belonging to a seldom indicated remedy.

395
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:07,880
But you once you have seen it live then you will recognize it when you have a patient coming.

396
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:16,360
"They are people who love life and live it to the outmost.

397
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:35,530
Enjoying it to the limit and sometimes they will be euphoric [...] and apparently almost ecstatic.

398
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:44,780
It's an interesting observation that the poisoning of this remedy creates a tremendous...

399
00:51:48,960 --> 00:52:07,970
she does not have that but doesn't matter... This remedy gets involved in arguments and quarrels."

400
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:19,960
Crotalus... The remedy is Crotalus.

401
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:26,360
"They get involved in cultural discussions with great animation

402
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:37,940
and also express emotions in a spontaneous, direct and many times even aggressive way.

403
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:48,840
They are sentimental and temperamental. They will get what they want from life.

404
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:57,620
And if necessary fight for it." You get the idea behind.

405
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:10,620
They have also fears such as fear of death for themselves and also for others,

406
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:18,380
anxiety for those who they love but also fear of strangers, fear of people,

407
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:28,760
fear of narrow crowded places. The idea here is that they cannot tolerate restrictions.

408
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:36,120
Especially those in the pit of the stomach and the throat.

409
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:49,590
But the idea of not being able to tolerate any kind of imposition, restriction is there.

410
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:55,630
They are attached to their family members and will take care of them.

411
00:53:55,730 --> 00:54:04,640
They suffer very much if those who are closed to them are in trouble or sick.

412
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:22,760
And then such people there is another phase in which they come to the opposite state

413
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:35,860
and when problems start going deeper irritability and sometimes instability arises.

414
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:46,360
Even a very slight external influence may cause a breakdown in the emotional equilibrium.

415
00:54:46,840 --> 00:55:01,010
And then tremendous weakness all over as if some evil were apprehended. Said it in a way.

416
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:12,370
Excessive irritability, snappish temper; irritable, cross, infuriated by least annoyance.

417
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:22,170
Soon this instability passes and the patient goes into depression and indifference.

418
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:30,540
The patient becomes melancholic, apathetic and shuns people, throws people away.

419
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:36,270
With sudden weakness, headache, heartache and diarrhea.

420
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:47,810
Depression and indifference towards everything. Great ill-humor and prostration.

421
00:55:50,030 --> 00:56:00,280
And this I'm reading it from my Materia Medica which the remedy is Crotalus horridus.

422
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:14,550
But when I saw the case I wrote down another remedy not crot-h

423
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:19,050
which is very close to this remedy.

424
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:30,250
I wrote down this and it's very interesting that as he was putting up the symptoms

425
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:37,930
the remedy came up quite highly and I want to show you this now.

426
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:46,850
Show them the symptoms which you have put. And you will see a very interesting thing...

427
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:55,320
Also I forgot to read to you that the cascavella... ok I said the remedy.

428
00:56:55,420 --> 00:57:03,310
Ok horridus and cascavella they have right sided problems where lach is left sided.

429
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:10,720
It looks quite a lot like lach but it is not lach.

430
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:22,440
So you see this temperament, this aggressive, responsive, snappish...

431
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:32,650
The symptoms now become of different importance.

432
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:40,390
What is important now in this case is the description of the mental emotional picture.

433
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:45,980
Unless you have it in your mind it is going to be very difficult

434
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:53,230
but still if you put all the symptoms, you put how many symptoms,

435
00:57:55,250 --> 00:58:08,970
14 symptoms and you ask...generalities wine, dancing, fear of dark of ghosts,

436
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:17,000
in a hurry, indifference, irritability, rudeness, sensitive to reprimands,

437
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:22,960
loves thunderstorm... he put every case.

438
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:32,710
See now something very interesting. I wrote down the remedy crotalus cascavela quite early

439
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:39,850
when I understood the picture. Now it is very interesting with 14 symptoms

440
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:49,590
crot-c comes in 2nd position.

441
00:58:51,570 --> 00:59:01,960
How come? See the program and understand the difficulty we have with homeopathy

442
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:20,640
that if you ask this compass to explain to you why he chooses as a 2nd remedy crot-c

443
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:45,100
how many symptoms do you think crot-c will have out of 14? 5. Crot-c has only 5 out of 14.

444
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:54,880
Carc comes first which is an interesting idea but carc is not that aggressive,

445
00:59:54,980 --> 01:00:14,150
is very sensitive to reprimands, actually you have to change it here to 3rd degree.

446
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:25,870
Reprimands should be of the 4th degree. I'm correcting this all the time.

447
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:32,920
Of course as you understand it never ends, it's a constant headache...

448
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:41,630
give me the next after crot, it's staph.

449
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:52,540
It's 6 symptoms. Ok, give me lach. 7 symptoms. Give me tarent. 6 symptoms.

450
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:58,640
Give me cenchrix. One symptom.

451
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:14,390
Give me crot-h. 4 symptoms. Give orig. 3 symptoms. Calc. 7 symptoms.

452
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:28,140
Lyc. 6 symptoms. 9 nine symptoms for lyc.

453
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:46,840
So this is something which shows you the difficulty we have in choosing the remedy

454
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:58,210
and it's not enough to have mechanical tools that can give us...

455
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:09,800
we have to know at the same time the M.M. to have studied the M.M. and understand M.M.

456
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:27,150
Who found the crot-c? I told you it's going to be difficult.

457
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:32,660
That's why you are here. Don't get disappointed.

458
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:43,550
Because if you get disappointed forget it you will never learn, you will never try really.

459
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:54,080
I was in the same despair when back in the 60s when I was meeting such case,

460
01:02:54,180 --> 01:03:01,660
could not solve the case and I could read all M.M. right through for one case.

461
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:10,330
I remember one time I took the case of a nice girl, she was so nice and I liked her very much.

462
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:19,170
I wanted to help her. I could not find the remedy. I tried for 2-3 hours forget it,

463
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:29,910
I studied after that, forget it then I slept. And I woke up in the morning

464
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:34,680
and I said "Oh my God, this is an ign case".

465
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:44,070
As soon as I woke up, my subconscious mind was still working out the case.

466
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:52,900
I gave it of course and it was a beautiful cure. But nothing happened.

467
01:03:54,850 --> 01:04:00,010
Because I know you like to know the full story.

468
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:12,860
She got out of the ign state and she was not anymore fascinating.

469
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:32,170
This just to tell you in order to cure somebody how much effort has to be.

470
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:39,320
When I see a case I feel exhausted afterwards.

471
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:46,990
Just to see 2 cases a day for me it's beyond my capacity.

472
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:57,080
Especially difficult cases, if it is an easy case I know you give staph and finish,

473
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:00,200
nat-m or ign and you finish.

474
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:08,660
But if it as realy difficult case and you want to help  then takes really effort

475
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:16,490
and you have to be really dedicated. I want to help this person.

476
01:05:16,590 --> 01:05:31,330
And the idea of a good homeopath, when you have inside the desire to help, the knowledge will come.

477
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:48,070
It is unbelievable. For me I have seen this again and again because the click comes...

478
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:50,660
that's the remedy finally.

479
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:58,480
This remedy now is going to start... for the first time really

480
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:13,910
she is going to feel better and grounded. She is beyond control. Nobody can control her.

481
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:23,130
After crot-c she will become more manageable, more human, she will understand,

482
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:39,770
it's not that "I am" the selfish element which we see, it will come down, it will be grounded.

483
01:06:45,230 --> 01:07:10,060
What potency? Who wants to give 30CH? 200CH? 1M? 10M? 50M? Nobody.

484
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:19,240
- What is the remedy?
- Crotalus cascavela.

485
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:45,620
I was reading from horridus which is very close to cascavela... I haven't written the cascavela

486
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:52,660
but it is very close to horridus. So I was reading from horridus.

487
01:07:52,760 --> 01:08:00,130
Because if  started telling you what are the symptoms of this woman

488
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:07,200
you would think "He just saw the symptoms and he comes and tell us the symptoms".

489
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:20,290
I want to show you that there is a science that this type of person has been recorded

490
01:08:20,390 --> 01:08:33,950
and it exists in our M.M. but I have omitted  it because I don't write it with every remedy I have omitted

491
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:49,620
crot-c and not crot-h but they are very similar. They are both right sided remedies.

492
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:57,270
They are both this kind of person that is so easily offended

493
01:08:57,370 --> 01:09:05,280
that with the least thing they will attack you, with the least provocation they will attack,

494
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:10,350
they will say whatever they want without control,

495
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:18,960
without ever being able to think what's going to happen if I speak so badly to the other person.

496
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:31,090
I wanted to read it from a similar remedy which is crot-h to prove to you

497
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:36,110
that there is already recorded...

498
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:52,250
Thank you, you saved my life. You learn a new remedy. You were lucky.

499
01:09:54,020 --> 01:10:09,370
- When I looked at your repertorization possible rubrics like abused being or after abused being.

500
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:17,680
My question is do you avoid to take a rubrics with a possible cause

501
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:23,980
and just go for just characteristic symptoms at the present?

502
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:29,720
- Yes. I understand you question.

503
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:43,330
The thing is this that if you have a picture of a remedy you do not go

504
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:51,690
and give a lot of importance to the causative factor.

505
01:10:52,170 --> 01:11:00,730
If you don't have a clear picture of a remedy then you try different remedies

506
01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:05,810
then you may try the causative factor remedy.

507
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:11,830
For instance somebody had a head injury and he is depressed.

508
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:17,720
Just because of that you may give nat-s.

509
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:25,890
but if you have a picture of calc you give calc forgetting the causative factor.

510
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:33,220
The causative factor will play a role when the rest of the case is not clear,

511
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:37,570
it does not give you really the answer.

512
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:50,730
Many times of course the cases they don't have enough symptoms but she was full of symptoms,

513
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:57,520
she gave all the picture without any restriction.

514
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:09,130
Before entering she said "I need a remedy for anxiety", I said "Don't worry".

515
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:13,340
But I understood the moment she would start taking she would forget everything.

516
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:24,560
She forgot about the class, the whole situation, because all this internal intensity,

517
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:34,980
it was there. So thank you very much. Potency? Give 10M.
