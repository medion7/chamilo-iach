1
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:27,540
Sleeplessness was the original problem, from slightest noise impossible to sleep,

2
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,040
waking from slightest noise, it takes 3-4 hours to fall asleep

3
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:46,590
and then you had fear of being alone in the night "probably from being frightened

4
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:54,100
when I was a little boy, I saw a man standing with a knife in the doorway..."

5
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,120
- It could be a delusion.

6
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:09,820
- Loves animals, bad memory, fear of snakes and heights, did not like school,

7
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,160
he was a bad boy.

8
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:28,570
Medical history; as a child he had a lot of ear infections treated with antibiotics,

9
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:37,180
have had all the children diseases, never takes chemical drugs.

10
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:48,510
You never took marijuana?
- Long time ago. Not much.

11
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:03,340
- High fever, last time was in December. Never severe acutes.

12
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:36,340
And the first remedy I prescribed was coff 10M and sleeplessness continued for some time...

13
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,450
- Yes but the first nights I slept good after coff. But then it went up and down.

14
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,020
- And how is it now?
- Much better.

15
00:02:50,780 --> 00:03:00,020
I still have it but not so often. I am still sensitive to noise, when I'm about to sleep.

16
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,680
- And there was another remedy I prescribed to you

17
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:14,020
when you started having problems with your knee.

18
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:19,600
- I think you gave me physostigma.

19
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:31,020
- Yes but for what reason?
- I can't remember.

20
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,770
- Very nice...

21
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:46,260
- But you gave me bry also for an injury in my thumb and I got numb.

22
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,010
- A bad injury?
- I have still pain.

23
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:08,650
But the pain was better after bry but now... You gave me nat-m also

24
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,160
when I was here in the first follow up.

25
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,160
- Then you wrote me that your thumb was better, still painful

26
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:25,190
but the biggest problem for you was your ex-girlfriend has made it clear

27
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:30,660
that "she has moved on without me"
- We separated.

28
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:38,240
- "And that is really destroying me and I'm crying all the time."

29
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,090
You look very hard man but...
- I'm not.

30
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:51,340
- "I'm alone."
- I never cry in front of people.

31
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:58,500
- "I really feel miserable, I'm thinking about her all the time.

32
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,750
I know it's normal to feel bad when something like this happens

33
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,980
but this is really really bad right now.

34
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,260
So, is there something I can do?" so what can I do, I send you a remedy?

35
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,830
- You gave me nat-m every day for 10 days.

36
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:26,340
- And what happened? You forgot.
- Completely. No it was much better.

37
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,650
- So how is the situation now?
- With the girlfriend?

38
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,560
- She left. You have another girlfriend?
- Yes.

39
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,250
- I can see it.

40
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:56,650
- But my main problem now is I'm more prone to injuries with my muscles. And also my allergy.

41
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,190
- You have another injury?
- Lots of them.

42
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,570
- You are driving a motorbike?

43
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:17,750
- No. I'm training in martial arts. And I think I'm more prone to injuries than anybody else.

44
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,650
- You know the Indians, what they say?

45
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,000
It's your karma.
- Ok. I hope not.

46
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,150
- Ok, you have to be more careful than others. Did you injure yourself?

47
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:43,160
Because I can see your body is more strong now in general. Is that correct?

48
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,990
- Maybe.

49
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:52,910
- You are doing martial arts still in spite of the fact you injured yourself?

50
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,570
- Yes.

51
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,730
- Do you know why you are injuring yourself more than others?

52
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:10,310
- Maybe because I am better on my emotional plane than the physical plane.

53
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:23,550
- Do you have pains now because of these injuries?

54
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,340
- Yes.

55
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,570
- Where?

56
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:34,870
- In my arms and sprinkle in my foot and toe and rib.

57
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:42,720
Strained muscle here, also small pain in my knees, a little stiff joints.

58
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,700
- You are injured when you are fighting with somebody?

59
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:05,560
- Yes but not only fighting, also when we make some kicks. I can easily strain a muscle.

60
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:16,200
When I got injured in my arms I didn't train for three weeks but there was no effect.

61
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,450
But then you gave me a rhus-t 200CH for this and my knee was very good.

62
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:31,800
But the arms did not have an effect. But then I took rhus-t 200CH every day for 5 days

63
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:40,140
and that was much better but not completely good. So I start training again.

64
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:51,450
- So you are a picture of health actually.
- I have a good diet.

65
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,860
- Very good diet, healthy life.

66
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,360
- Yes, I have a lot of stress for the moment

67
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,360
because when I split up with my girlfriend I had to sell the house

68
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,880
because it was too expensive to live in and we are going to lose in euros

69
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,460
maybe 150.000 when we sell the house.

70
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:17,460
It's a lot of money and right now the market is bad so no one is buying.

71
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:25,960
It costs a lot to hold the house every month. So it's a little bit stress.

72
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,100
- But except of homeopathy do you do something else?

73
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,890
- Yes.

74
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,940
- And you are having a girlfriend or many girlfriends?

75
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,780
- I have one girlfriend.

76
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,440
- Only one at the moment. And you are happy with her?

77
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,960
- Yes. I have some questions but it's ok.

78
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:06,940
- You eat a healthy diet you say.
- Most of the time.

79
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:14,710
- You eat fruits?
- Yes, I like fruits, mostly bananas.

80
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:25,380
It's easy to eat. I eat 3 bananas a day sometimes.

81
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:41,330
- Not other fruits? Only bananas? I see you are not interested very much in fruits.

82
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,870
- I eat fruit. I don't have an aversion.

83
00:10:53,100 --> 00:11:06,760
- Are you sighing?
- Maybe sometimes. I also have a new grief.

84
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:16,350
I had to put my dog to sleep, before 2 months ago; to take her away. She is dead.

85
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:22,330
- Your dog. She was sick.
- Yes. That was also a grief.

86
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:24,580
- You were connected with your dog.

87
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,680
- Yes. I had 2 dogs I had to put away in 9 months.

88
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,190
- With distemper?
- No, some other problems.

89
00:11:51,850 --> 00:12:04,370
- You are easily offended?
- Maybe it depends. Maybe I can be.

90
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:19,600
But it depends on what they are saying. I think I'm also very obstinate.

91
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:33,750
- If somebody says something that hurts you how long this may last inside you?

92
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,350
- I don't think so long. I forgive very easily.

93
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:53,580
I had my ganglion, it was doing better after rhus-t but it has been bigger now.

94
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,910
- Cold, hot, you tolerate both?

95
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:14,250
- I tolerate not cold, not hot. But mostly cold, I don't like too hot either.

96
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:24,980
- But you cannot tolerate the cold.
- The heat is because I don't like to perspire.

97
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,240
- When you perspire where do you perspire?
- Under my arms.

98
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,730
- Not in the face.
- No, maybe in my forehead.

99
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:48,380
- What do you like to eat? Do you like to eat something special?

100
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,390
- I like sweets very much, especially chocolate.

101
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:59,060
- What else?
- Salt. Anything spicy.

102
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,210
- You put extra salt in your food?

103
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:09,060
- Yes, always. I would have taken more if I knew it's not good for me.

104
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:18,210
- You restrict yourself. But after nat-m it was not reduced?

105
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,810
- No.

106
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,820
- You like lemon?

107
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:33,320
- I like it on French fries and maybe fish but not very much.

108
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,000
- Eggs?

109
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:45,560
- I eat eggs, 2 eggs a day, soft boiled.

110
00:14:52,060 --> 00:15:02,220
- Your feet in bed are usually cold or normal? Do you have to put on socks?

111
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,340
- If I'm cold I put socks on but normally not.

112
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,810
- Sweden up to what degree the temperature can go down.
- Minus 20 degree.

113
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:35,050
In my house it's cold, maybe 17-18 degrees when it's winter

114
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:42,230
and then I have socks on because it's too cold.

115
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:52,210
- 17-18 is low. You are not calc. Calc needs 23-24 degrees.

116
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,310
- But I need more, it's too cold.

117
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,050
- You keep it low because of expenses.
- Yes.

118
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,440
- You are not perspiring around your neck.

119
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:15,780
- No. My fear of high places is better.

120
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:37,450
- The fear of being alone in the night?
- Still there but I think it's better also.

121
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:47,450
- Fear of snakes?
- I don't like snakes.

122
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:56,840
- There is fear. In bed there is restlessness or you sleep more...

123
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,370
- It's always restless before I go to sleep. I change position.

124
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,620
- But when I sleep I don't think I'm restless.

125
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:14,290
I'm also a little bit restless when I'm sitting. I have to change positions.

126
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:26,520
I have some symptoms like the one we talked about just before.

127
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,020
I cannot urinate in front of others. It's impossible.

128
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,350
I can urinate if I got to the toilet and there are other people around

129
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:39,450
but if I am standing in public toilets with people beside me, it's impossible.

130
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,850
- What potency I gave you? 200CH?
- 10M.

131
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,600
- Nat-m?

132
00:17:48,700 --> 00:18:02,040
- Yes, 10M when I was here. But the latest was 200CH.

133
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,600
- Because of the separation.
- Yes.

134
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:29,610
- Do you think that you need a remedy?
- Yes. I also want to get rid of the allergy.

135
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,850
- In spring time.
- In the summer.

136
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:52,360
Mostly in the eyes and I always get coryza when it's cold. And lacrimation also from wind.

137
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:02,610
- There is any salivation during sleep?
- No.

138
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,100
- Sexually you feel ok?
- Yes.

139
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,860
- Are you able to express emotions with your girlfriend?

140
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:35,420
- I don't like to weep. I cry when I am alone most of the time but when...

141
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,370
- But expressing emotions say "I love you" and this kind of things.

142
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,430
- Yes, I can do that.

143
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:54,140
- If you stay under the sun, you can tolerate it?

144
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:04,170
- I think so. It's the perspiration I don't like from the sun also.

145
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:22,420
- From which pharmacy you get the remedies?
- Helios. England.

146
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:37,420
- What was the effect of 10M in comparison with 200CH later? Which was more effective?

147
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:47,410
- The 10M. The 200CH was more acute.

148
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,920
- Ok I'll give you the remedy.

149
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:22,760
Why he gets injuries more than others? Who can tell? She can tell.

150
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,950
You're an athlete? No.

151
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:55,760
-  I think emotionally he's not well yet and he has to prove something

152
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:02,420
and then when he practices, he practices with a lot of ego proving something,

153
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:08,520
doing more and then he has these injuries. I have seen this...

154
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:29,520
- But why he has injuries? You approach very much with what you say. Very tight.

155
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:41,270
He's quite tight still in general, he's not loose enough

156
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:48,020
when he fights to fall in a placid way.

157
00:22:49,030 --> 00:23:03,290
He falls and he is tight and this tightness manifests in the muscles still,

158
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:13,690
so it is a deep thing which I doubt if we can touch it with a remedy.

159
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:27,330
It's a thing that comes from very young age,

160
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:32,940
most probably is his character to be rather tight.

161
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:48,340
But he has 2 symptoms still, on which we can justify to try once again;

162
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,440
which are the 2 symptoms?

163
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:00,000
- In the presence of others he cannot urinate...

164
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:10,810
- And the other? Desires salt. And there is a third one which is not mentioned there

165
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:20,400
but I know it, where nat-m is bothered by perspiration, they don't like to perspire.

166
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,400
I've said in the M.M. but I don't see it there.

167
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:40,480
Still if you make the "solve" still with symptoms nat-m is coming first.

168
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:49,880
So we can be justified though in this state usually you leave alone,

169
00:24:49,980 --> 00:25:01,130
you say "Continue your life" but because he says that still the desire for salt is so strong,

170
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:13,840
still he has this timidity in urinating which is characteristic of nat-m

171
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:26,580
and he has also the aggravation, he does not like the perspiration, will give him nat-m 50M

172
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:34,980
and we'll see what happens.

173
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:48,440
Maybe it will take a few years and a few things in your life which make you more loose.

174
00:25:50,390 --> 00:26:00,130
Your life has been such that you are on guard all the time, something may happen.

175
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:08,100
So you are tight. Something may happen, let it happen.

176
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:24,730
So who agrees with this prescription? Thank you I have some supporters.

177
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,340
You can ask some questions.

178
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:50,540
- The first dose was nat-m 10M. I don't understand why you gave nat-m 200CH.

179
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,560
- Because I could not remember what I have given him already.

180
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:23,860
I received all these e-mails and I don-t have the whole picture of the case.

181
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:31,220
If I had to go and read right through what I've done before... Forget it.

182
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:38,220
I would be needing 26 hours a day.

183
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:50,880
- You have given nat-m 10M to him and since then he told you he is doing better.

184
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,860
The symptoms which we have; he cannot urinate in the presence of others, desires salt,

185
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,850
and he wants to cry alone in a room... All these are symptoms of nat-m.

186
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:06,110
You see nat-m is working on him and still...

187
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:13,790
- It needs to go deeper. Go on a higher potency, that's all we can do.

188
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,440
He needs still nat-m to stimulate him.

189
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:28,990
That means if we stimulate we expect that he will react because the keynotes are still there.

190
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:38,680
But if somebody feels good, in spite of the fact he may still have some keynotes we can wait.

191
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:47,180
We can say "wait..." then many  go away without further dose.

192
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:54,600
- What is your opinion about repeating the same remedy in the same potency?

193
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:06,180
- If it is needed. If had a headache I would say take "Ok, take nat-m".

194
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:12,580
Now I am hesitating because I see him in a good condition in general.

195
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:22,830
Otherwise if he had a real problem I would say yes take it.

196
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:35,700
But he has no real problem. He's quite healthy. But maybe 50M if it is potentized properly...

197
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,680
This is a big problem with potencies.

198
00:29:41,780 --> 00:30:00,260
50M means 50000 times you put the 99 drops and one of the previous shake it 20 times,

199
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,260
empty it, refill it, shake 20 times...

200
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:16,380
If you do it really it will take 15 days with a computer, with a robot to do 50M.

201
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:28,330
So I'm not sure if they are doing it properly. And Korsakoff is not correct for me.

202
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:38,580
Because they inject with force water on the bottle still it works

203
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:45,940
but I don't know how it works, really, I cannot explain that. I am more classic.

204
00:30:47,600 --> 00:31:04,670
But I am using from several companies, using sometimes 2-3 companies together

205
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:13,470
and there are 2-3 companies of Greece they produce also

206
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:27,460
but it's not what I want as the perfect remedy and the effect when I use this,

207
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:35,470
I have some of these remedies produced in Italy the effect was really impressive.

208
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:47,020
And where somebody like him... You see he got 10M and he had some effect but not deep enough.

209
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:54,530
If he had good potentized remedy the effect would be different.

210
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,530
Question, yes.

211
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:16,440
- When it is that you are sure what was the remedy which you prescribe?

212
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:22,560
When you asked this man "Is it easy for you to forgive?"

213
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:28,180
and I was expecting him to say no and on the contrary you stumbled, I mean I did,

214
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,760
when he said "I forgive easily".

215
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:37,270
What is your general analysis of the case that you have 3 general symptoms

216
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:42,950
that go to the wrong way and the core of nat-m has to me the resentment and he is not,

217
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:48,680
or he says he is not? What's your attitude in general in patients...?

218
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:55,180
- You're asking me if I believed him? Or not? That's one.

219
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,380
- This is what he said.

220
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:08,510
- But the fact that he said that that he can forgive for me

221
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:15,260
this is something of no importance anymore. That means I don't have a symptom to prescribe.

222
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,540
It's normal. It's a normal reaction of a healthy man.

223
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:31,850
In spite of the fact he looks quite sensitive and offended easily

224
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:39,300
and you expect he would offended he said "I go over it easily".

225
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:45,930
So that means this area in the brain is healthy.

226
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:59,600
I don't expect always to have all the symptoms of a remedy. Mental, emotional etc...

227
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:11,870
You can have a person with keynote symptoms of a remedy and a healthy mind

228
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,750
where he would respond...

229
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:19,660
- ... in nat-m you have to have resentment or hate...

230
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:30,660
- You don't have to have as long as you have... You see 3-4 keynotes of nat-m are enough.

231
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,510
Is he offended easily?

232
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:49,120
For nat-m there is some pathology on the mental emotional level which is very severe,

233
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:58,260
with depression, they don't want to talk to anybody etc.

234
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:09,610
If the person says "I don't have that" it does not take me away from the remedy

235
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:17,260
if I have the keynote symptoms of the physical body.

236
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:28,910
So he has the general idea of tightness I describe it as "tightness" I cannot find a better word,

237
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:39,760
he feels tight that's why when he falls down, he falls down and he's tight. He's not loose.

238
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:51,900
People are learning to fall down from the motorbike by becoming loose and let it happen.

239
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:03,460
This he cannot do it yet. This is so far the pathology which I see on an emotional level.

240
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:09,150
But if I take into consideration his life, you have not seen his case,

241
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,500
who has seen his original case?

242
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:23,660
You remember, some dramatic things happened in his early life.

243
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:31,670
So if you see that you justify this tightness, this carefulness.

244
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:36,310
- I want to ask you another question. 
- Yes.

245
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:43,820
Was it expected what I said by you? I don't think.

246
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,320
- Yes. I was sure that you were going to say that.

247
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:54,820
The thing is I dismiss my patient when the mental symptom does not go inside with the generals.

248
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:04,830
I see that you don't give much importance to dreams.

249
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,920
You don't ask much about dreams and illusions.

250
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,900
- I don't ask everybody. That is true.

251
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:18,260
But if something triggers my mind I will ask about dreams.

252
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:29,420
If I want to confirm some things. Especially when the person is not talking a lot.

253
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:38,680
Then I have to search an area which is a subconscious area. Then I ask.

254
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:52,780
But a general idea with me taking a case is I take a case as long I need to prescribe.

255
00:37:52,880 --> 00:38:02,820
I don't go further. I am not inquisitive. I got enough information, I can prescribe, stop.

256
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:10,080
I don't go and ask and make psychoanalysis and think like that.

257
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:23,890
- I agree that he was very tense. You can see his jaws were going up and down all the time

258
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,640
but since he responded so well to rhus-t

259
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,300
don't you think that there is also underlying some inflammatory disease...

260
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:47,980
- This rhus-t was an acute for the injury. The rhus-t could not deal with more than that but...

261
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:53,140
- But usually when people are on rhus-t they often inflammatory conditions in...

262
00:38:53,240 --> 00:39:06,120
- Yes. He had injuries and rhus-t covered the acute, that means the injuries.

263
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:12,220
Not the tightness, not what we are discussing now.

264
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:17,410
- So you don't think he also has an inflammation in joints and muscles...

265
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:23,680
- Maybe but not very much. I don't consider it as much.

266
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:31,230
- I wanted to ask you about what the lady before said that there is no hate, he can forgive.

267
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:38,790
I perceived the case, he was more hurt and he can forgive on the surface

268
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:44,780
but deep inside he is still hurt by so many things and it is like a curtain

269
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:54,760
which he draws in front... The fear of being injured or hurt comes through,

270
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:58,720
what you said, with the tension he can fall loosely. He injures himself.

271
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:06,720
-  You can explain it in this way. But for me I would never prescribe for that.

272
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:11,510
I would prescribe if I knew he cannot urinate in front of others,

273
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:20,690
if he has desire for salt, if he's bothered by perspiration. Then I would prescribe.

274
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:24,180
If he had only that I would not prescribe.

275
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,680
- Yes but he doesn't have to say it he is fearful of being hurt.

276
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:38,930
- True but what he said is "If I am hurt I go over it quickly" where nat-m

277
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:47,800
if he is hurt it will take 2 years before he can to get rid of it.

278
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:55,200
They go and think all the time about this "why he told me that..."

279
00:40:55,990 --> 00:41:08,920
He does not seem to have that. Also when he wrote to me that his girlfriend left him

280
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:25,090
he described it in such a way that I could not see the real nat-m picture,

281
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:45,950
but still... I had no other option. But the nat-m will cry but alone and not a lot.

282
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:51,690
He said "I'm crying day and night". That's not nat-m.

283
00:41:52,690 --> 00:42:04,510
The typical nat-m they try to control, they try not to become ridiculous because of that issue.

284
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:22,500
The end of the class, thank you.
