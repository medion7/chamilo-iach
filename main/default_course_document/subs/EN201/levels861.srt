1
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:21,670
So, you're 41 and you had developed a tumor 3 by 3 in the left side of the skull,

2
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,650
in the base of the skull. What kind of tumor?

3
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:34,080
- In medicine they say schwannoma , it is not a bad type of tumor.

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:47,900
- Benign tumor of nerves sheath by several neurosurgeons,

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,820
they recommend us urgent surgery, 5 months before.

6
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:03,480
- When did they discover this? November 2011 
- Accidentally, by chance.

7
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:10,170
- Why did you go? 
- I had a pain on my neck.

8
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,640
- Both sides. 
- Yes.

9
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:21,700
While I was sleeping I had a neck pain, therefore went to hospital because my wife is a doctor,

10
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:33,450
to one of her friends she is a surgeon, brain surgery, she's our friend,

11
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:44,530
she said "Ok, go make an MRI". She suggested to take MRI,

12
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:50,700
she said while you are here let's have a full scan of your brain as well.

13
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:58,110
- Did you find any hernia?
- Yes, I put it under 3. Number 3 is the hernia.

14
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:08,280
- Cervical hernia, most probably the pain was from hernia.

15
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,440
- They said exactly the same thing. This is from the hernia.

16
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,870
This kind of tumors, did not make any pain.

17
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:28,030
Fortunately there is no any effect because this tumor, we have been told,

18
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:39,540
this is touching the nerves of hearing and nerves of talking, speech.

19
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,370
We've asked what is the risk if we make an operation.

20
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:53,800
They said if we make the operation there is a chance of 20% I might lose one of my ears

21
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:02,230
or I might lose some vocabulary, my speech might be changed.

22
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:09,890
There is also risk of facial paralysis. Because it is on the left side,

23
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,070
there is a risk for the hearing on the left side, speech on the left side,

24
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,780
also facial paralysis on the left side.

25
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,070
Then we started to look for different solutions

26
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:31,720
because also my wife was taking some lessons of Homeopathy.

27
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,640
We said ok we will not make an operation, we will try different solutions,

28
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:44,340
if there is no solution after 1-2 years, if we have to make an operation we will make the operation.

29
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:55,820
Because as of today this was found out 5 months before, in 5 months we don't see any effects,

30
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,680
we are not losing any hearing, we are not losing any speech

31
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:07,380
and there is no effect and what we have done 5 months before we had this MRI,

32
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:15,020
one month before we took another MRI, we made the comparison between the 2 MRIs.

33
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:24,050
This tumor became 1mm smaller than it was. It became smaller.

34
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,880
We don't know if there is a difference because of the machines.

35
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:36,600
- There was a very small difference, but still there is no growth.

36
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:47,760
- Exactly. There is no growth in 5 months. This is out luck, let's say.

37
00:04:50,250 --> 00:05:01,700
The second good news is there are no symptoms, no signs.

38
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:17,750
- So gastroenterology; burning sensation in stomach and esophagus since 2005, why is that?

39
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:27,130
- I assume it is because I was too much under stress, I'm very nervous.

40
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,910
- Are you a businessman?
-Yes.

41
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:39,520
- You started your business during that time?
-No, I started it in 2002.

42
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,630
But 2004 and 2003 was like difficult years.

43
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:50,090
There was too much concern, there was too much risk in the business...

44
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,600
I'm thinking these are the reasons.

45
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:01,110
- That's right, correct. And since then you are taking regularly medicine, every morning.

46
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:10,870
One anti-acid?
-No, pump inhibitors, for protection.

47
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,280
- 2 pump inhibitors

48
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:22,830
- Lowers acidity.

49
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:29,640
- You have to take it every morning with empty stomach,

50
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:37,620
before you eat you have to wait half an hour at least and the food is not affecting.

51
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,850
- And you don't have side effects from this, you don't feel any discomfort,

52
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,150
any other symptoms?
-Not much.

53
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:56,730
What we have tried, every 3-4 months we are changing the medicine

54
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,750
because there are like 3-4 different kind of medicines.

55
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,760
If there are side effects we are changing it

56
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:15,780
because I have been told especially for the one I am taking right now, may effect erection.

57
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:23,530
The doctor told you might have less erection in your sexuality if you use it regularly.

58
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,440
Therefore I'm changing it but I didn't see any side effects.

59
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,280
- Does this contain any kind of hormone?
-No hormones.

60
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:45,670
- It's the first time I hear about that medicine, I don't know what it is.

61
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,580
- It stopped acid production of stomach.

62
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:05,530
-That's quite strong medication.
-Yes. What I'm using is Nexium now.

63
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:25,870
I ask if she had one with her to show you what is inside.

64
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,370
- These are quite deep remedies, not simple.

65
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:47,450
Because you could manage with a little bit of soda water, it would be the same and very simple.

66
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:52,890
That is quite strong medication.

67
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,080
If it manages to suppress the production of acidity of the stomach

68
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:05,570
that means it acts very deeply in the organism and you will have some side effects

69
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:12,320
maybe you don't realize, maybe you don't feel less energetic.

70
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,080
- I feel less energetic, this is true.

71
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:28,410
- And seems when you have this pain here in the neck, since how many years?

72
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,070
- Since November 2011.

73
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,350
- It's not 5 months it's 7 months.

74
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,590
- But in the end of November, 20th November. 6 months total.

75
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:03,140
20th November exactly, we went to the doctor for MRI.

76
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,910
This is the day we learned we got the tumor therefore I remember the day exactly.

77
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:21,030
- And then pain in the root of the neck, both sides, there are two trigger points.

78
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:27,130
One is the left and the other is the right side of the neck.

79
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,350
Why you call them trigger point?

80
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:41,820
- Because if I press here it's something like walnut or hazelnut.

81
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:50,070
If you press here, I'm feeling the pain starting here and it goes here, it goes up,

82
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:56,000
deep inside, it goes like this.

83
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,480
If I press this one the same  from this side starting from the back side of the neck

84
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:15,030
goes inside deep in skull like this. If I'm nervous, stressed or angry the pain starts itself.

85
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:26,430
- Do you feel tired?
- I don't know.

86
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:41,580
- Aggravated by stress, anger, in some positions, during lying.

87
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,200
Pain can wake up through the night. And what do you have to do?

88
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,130
Do you have to move your neck and crack it?

89
00:11:52,230 --> 00:12:12,070
- What I do to have less pain, I'm making massage to both sides with analgesic gels.

90
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,240
- What kind of analgesic? Mesulid?

91
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:34,280
- Voltaren , I'm massaging from this side to this side... for 20 minutes

92
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,860
and then it is less and I can sleep.

93
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,750
And while I am sleeping, one pillow is not enough this is new

94
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,110
because of this I have to put the pillow double

95
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:56,890
- You want your head to be high?
- Right, for comfort.

96
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,060
I used to sleep with one pillow but of this pain now I'm making double pillow.

97
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,400
And I'm putting sometimes my hand under the pillow so it gives height...

98
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,760
- So, you sleep quietly or you turn a lot?
- Turn a lot.

99
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:29,150
- But you don't keep one position when you want to sleep you always lie on right side, abdomen...

100
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:41,560
- I lie in the right side and knees inside. This is the starting point of the sleep.

101
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,480
- But then you turn during the sleep.

102
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:51,360
- Always starts like that. Behind, always.

103
00:13:52,910 --> 00:14:06,070
- And also something between legs a pillow maybe.

104
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,550
- Touching your genitals?

105
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:16,580
-No, just between two knees if she's with me I'm taking her leg, if not I'm taking a pillow.

106
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:32,240
I don't like my knees touching each other. It's kind of reflex, I put something, a pillow...

107
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,830
- For ventilation?

108
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:46,680
- I just don't want two  knees to bump, touch each other, if no pillow I put her leg. No pain.

109
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:53,930
- Just the idea bones are touching. I just get used to it.

110
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,430
- How did you get the first idea.

111
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,050
- I have no idea, since I was a child.

112
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:12,510
- And you have also allergic rhinitis.
- This has started last year, first time.

113
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:34,540
It started itching my ears, inside of the nose, throat.

114
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,030
Like feeling of itching in the throat. Ears. 
- Only the right ear?

115
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:48,560
-No, both ears itching, and here both sides itching and inside of the nose itching.

116
00:15:48,660 --> 00:16:00,320
I am starting series of sneezing.

117
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:14,150
2-4 and after 40 minutes it comes again and then through the night I am also coughing.

118
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:27,240
Dry cough. But nothing comes. During the night there is a liquid coming from here to my mouth

119
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,780
and in the morning I have to go to the bathroom and take this liquid out.

120
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,110
This is generally more or less still the liquid which normally we have in the nose.

121
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:43,080
This is like goes from here to up. Last year a friend of us and my wife

122
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:49,660
because she was taking homeopathy lessons, they were working together in the hospital,

123
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,250
they are both doctors, they gave me a remedy.

124
00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:03,080
- What remedy?
- Arsenicum, and the day after it stops.

125
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:13,250
- No, they gave me 3 Arsenicum. One of them was 200CH, the other ones 30, 30.

126
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:27,830
The first day when I took 200CH, I felt dizzy, I thought I am dying because it was too much,

127
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,280
I was really dizzy. This was Friday.

128
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:39,740
Saturday I took another 30CH, stomach was slowed down, the feeling was 80% bad,

129
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,440
the next day it became 40%.

130
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:49,240
Saturday I was still dizzy, didn't want to go out because I was dizzy.

131
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:57,750
Sunday I took another one, the last 30CH, and the stomach was ok and the sneezing

132
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,830
and the liquidity everything was cut immediately.

133
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,040
Monday when I was going to the job there was nothing.

134
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:16,240
It stopped this year 20th April, one month ago it started again.

135
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:22,080
We were thinking of taking Arsenicum again but we said because we are coming here,

136
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:25,200
we didn't take anything.

137
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:31,130
Because our friend, she is an homeopath, but she's a learning homeopath.

138
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
But last year it cut immediately.

139
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,200
- The only homeopathic remedy is Arsenicum? No other remedy?

140
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,050
- No, just Arsenicum.

141
00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:05,100
- It was what she gave to me. Only Arsenicum. One 200CH and two 30,30.

142
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,740
- You are the only child? You have brothers or sisters?

143
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,590
-No, I'm the only child.

144
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,880
- Your parents, they are alive?
- Yes, they are here in the island.

145
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,050
They are drinking greek coffee somewhere in the Patitiri.

146
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:32,410
-But they are healthy?
- My father has a stomach problem.

147
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:39,230
- Duodenal ulcer, stomach ulcer?
- We don't know.

148
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:48,350
Two years before he got a bleeding in the stomach and they took him to the hospital,

149
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,570
they operated him...

150
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:54,300
- You have bled sometimes from the stomach?
-No, never.

151
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,860
3 years before I went to a doctor and they made endoscopy.

152
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:10,480
They look inside the film of this thing and they find several red points,

153
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:18,700
but small points which were hurt, they say ulcer.

154
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:28,290
There was an erosion in the surface of the stomach, they were like 7-8 small points

155
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:35,920
and they found second thing that the stomach changed it shape.

156
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:49,210
They said this is a hernia of stomach and the third thing they said in the esophagus

157
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:59,660
it becomes loose because the acid pushes this up...

158
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,740
- Did they speak about Barrett syndrome?
- No.

159
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,150
- You know Barrett syndrome?
- Yes, but no.

160
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,820
- One year later, I went to the same doctor and I did the same endoscopy again.

161
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,080
He said more or less nothing changed...

162
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:59,700
It was more or less the same number because I was taking the same medicine, one year time.

163
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,060
It feels good during the day.

164
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:08,820
You don't have a burn, you don't have a mass coming out, but it is not healing you.

165
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:16,960
Because I took endoscopy 3 times, every year one endoscopy and it doesn't heal,

166
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:22,030
it doesn't go worse, at least I can eat because if I am not taking medicine

167
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:31,930
I cannot eat hot, spicy things, sour things, I cannot eat chocolate, coffee,

168
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,950
I can't eat almost nothing.

169
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:42,860
Acid things, hot things I cannot eat, drink. If I take the medicine I can eat anything.

170
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:50,070
Cold milk and yoghurt is releasing pain in the stomach.

171
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,060
For example I forgot to take the medicine today,

172
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:03,070
I went and eat during the night 6-8 o'clock, it started to burn.

173
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:08,580
I am taking one glass of cold milk, it releases.

174
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:18,330
If I cannot find cold milk I am having yoghurt like 4-5 spoons of cold yoghurt it releases.

175
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,950
When I eat milk ice cream it releases.

176
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,340
- You like ice cream?
- Yes, I like ice cream.

177
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,640
- But excessive desire for ice cream?

178
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,690
- When I was a child I was eating a lot. But not lately.

179
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:46,450
- When you were a child, did you ever have nose bleeding? Your nose opened suddenly, bled.

180
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:50,710
- No. It was broken twice

181
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:57,690
- But not spontaneously.
- No. I had some friend that had it, not me.

182
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,260
I know what you mean.

183
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,950
- In general you are affected by weather?

184
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:17,990
If the weather is cold, you like it, or it's hot, you don't like it...

185
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,040
- To be honest I live in different part of the world.

186
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:31,990
I live in Turkey, I live in London, Austria like Vienna, I live in Australia Sydney,

187
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:37,050
therefore I've lived in different conditions

188
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,290
- Because of your job?

189
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:42,500
- Yes because of my father's job and my job I have to travel.

190
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,440
I live like 2 years in London, 2 years in Australia, 6 years in Vienna.

191
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:54,230
Vienna is very different than Istanbul. Istanbul is very different than London

192
00:24:54,330 --> 00:25:01,870
but I don't like too much grey weather, raining weather.

193
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:10,640
If it is grey and raining it is boring.

194
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:28,210
- But are you bothered by hot weather?
- Not really.

195
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,840
- By cold?
- Not really.

196
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:38,640
I can tolerate because my father was a soldier, a military officer,

197
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,520
therefore when I was a child we lived aged from 2 to 4 in the Russian borders.

198
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:56,270
It was -40C. Then we went to the greek borders it was average like 30C.

199
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:11,360
Then we moved to Antalya, the south of Turkey which was 40-50C. I get used easily.

200
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:15,650
-40 C in Kursk +40C in Antalya.

201
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,850
-Do you like sweets?
- Yes I like sweets.

202
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,590
- Eggs
- Yes.

203
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:37,460
- A lot?
- Sweet a lot. I like omelet, bacon omelet.

204
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:43,540
I can eat every day in the breakfast eggs without any problem.

205
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:51,860
- Actually, you eat every day 2 eggs in the morning?

206
00:26:53,790 --> 00:27:01,680
- We are trying not to eat much. But I can eat one egg every day.

207
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,770
But sweet every day. In the lunch time I can eat a profiterole,

208
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:12,360
I can eat a chocolate cake, in the night I can eat another one.

209
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:23,060
I always like sweets. I also like salt, very much.

210
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:30,650
I like salty things. I always put extra salt.

211
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:35,990
- Before tasting your food...
- I always put salt.

212
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:49,870
I like salt, I like sweets. The salt that I am using for most of the people is too much.

213
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,160
They say I am going to get blind because people believe salt makes you blind.

214
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:08,350
- You have a nice character. Very communicative.

215
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,940
- I'm very communicative.

216
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:20,040
- And you want to cure what? The hernia, the stomach or this?

217
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:34,040
-All of them! The first thing which is disturbing my life right now is hernia.

218
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,350
This is giving pain to me, that is what makes me up at 4 0'clock in the morning.

219
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:44,220
The second thing, it's like 6 months before I was really scared about this thing

220
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,480
because I've been in several doctors in Turkey they wanted to operate, but 3 months later

221
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,450
because I took the second MRI we saw it was not getting bigger,

222
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,510
it was getting less but the stomach is there since 6-7 years.

223
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,860
In the future I believe I will have an effect because of the medicine,

224
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,870
therefore this will need to be fixed as well.

225
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:23,120
- The hernia was in 2011.
- Yes, we recognized it in 2011.

226
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:30,640
-When the pain started?
- 6 months ago.

227
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,590
- How did I know it was 6 months ago?
- Because I just told you!

228
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:50,000
- No, I meant something else. On 2011 you discovered you had hernia. But the pain..

229
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:56,520
- 2 weeks before, maybe 1 month ago.

230
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:10,540
-Now the allergic rhinitis... when it started?
- Last year April.

231
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,070
But it was just one month.

232
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:16,920
- Last year April, that was the first time.

233
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:22,190
- First time in my life, in my 40s.

234
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:30,620
- Now the medicine for the stomach, when did you started it?

235
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:47,070
- I started 2005-2006. But I got 3 different medicines, they are similar,

236
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,180
but because I am afraid of side effects I was changing them.

237
00:30:52,850 --> 00:31:05,270
- The first remedy you started for the stomach was the same age to the pump inhibitor?

238
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:10,730
Or you started with the anti-acid?
- Yes, same medicine.

239
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,230
- I'll tell you know a secret.

240
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:30,230
The problem of hernia and also most probably of the tumor is because of this remedy.

241
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:38,660
Of the stomach because it suppresses the acidity of the stomach.

242
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,040
- Ok, it might be.

243
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:54,160
- Maybe it's not so simple. You see, now in order to...

244
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:59,590
- In order to fix one thing, you have to fix many things

245
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:06,960
- Yes...you have to stop taking the anti-acid remedy.

246
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:19,780
- Ok, if I have to I have to! I have to change my eating style.

247
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,610
- Eating habits.

248
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:29,370
For a time because if the remedy is correct, it will heal the problem with the stomach.

249
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,440
- Perfect.

250
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:38,370
- Your problem, what you have in the stomach is quite serious. And this is the most serious

251
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:46,710
because it tends to become what is called in medicine Barrett syndrome

252
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:54,450
which means that the cells start being differentiated

253
00:32:54,550 --> 00:33:06,180
that means they may become eventually unhealthy. So this is the secret.

254
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:13,200
Now I have to ask you something else.

255
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,360
You feel happy?
- Yes.

256
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:30,850
- You feel as happy as before 2000 or less happy? Now you are 40, when you were 30...

257
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:35,150
When did you marry?
- Two years ago.

258
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,830
- You have children?
- No.

259
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:40,430
- You don't want?
- Maybe next year.

260
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:54,850
It's a plan. First, we don't have children because she has a fear of having a child.

261
00:33:54,950 --> 00:34:00,830
This is her case. In her case you will find out why we don't have children.

262
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:07,930
- Ok, that means you take precautions.
-Yes.

263
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:17,730
Her position is quite serious. This is also making me precautious.

264
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:30,250
When I was 30 I had financial problems, right now I don't have at all financial problems

265
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:35,150
but I have different problems.

266
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:51,320
- No drugs, no cigarettes, social drinker, had rubella, smallpox, father

267
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:58,060
and uncle has similar stomach problems. Your stomach is the worst,

268
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:05,240
the weak point in your organism. And because of ancestors,

269
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:12,420
as well... they have the same problem. Now I want to ask you something else.

270
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:18,400
If you are in a high place, and you look down, do you have a problem?

271
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:24,320
- Not much. Because for example she has a big problem.

272
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:35,160
I can sit in the balcony on the 6th floor and I won't have any problem.

273
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:40,340
- If you look down?
- If you look down... it looks high!

274
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:47,990
Not a fear, but I can think for example if there is an earthquake

275
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:54,030
this is too high I can't jump,

276
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:58,400
if there is an earthquake maybe it is advantage to be in the balcony,

277
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:04,070
everything is collapsed, you can walk out, this is what I was thinking

278
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:11,090
but I think also if these things are not strong in the balcony, the protectors,

279
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,610
therefore I'm not touching them too much, if I touch and break I can fall down.

280
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:24,910
This makes me nervous. If I had to make it from one to ten, my heroism is 2 or 3.

281
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:34,860
- Is it sometimes that you look and you imagine it would be terrible

282
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,570
if I would fall from this height...
- You die.

283
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:50,960
- In the meantime you live this falling?
-No. I have not this kind of fear.

284
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:57,360
- When you have to go through a bridge and there is water...

285
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:05,740
-No problem. Because I used to drive every day the Bosporus bridge Asia to Europe,

286
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,330
I don't recognize this is a bridge. It is your daily life.

287
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:15,330
But she got a fear, I don't have it. I know the differences.

288
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:28,970
- Are you able to speak to strangers?
- Yes.

289
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,430
- Very easily.
- Yes.

290
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:35,750
- Do you perspire at all?

291
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:49,100
- Not much, but we recognize because we were driving from Istanbul to here,

292
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:56,760
8 hours, driving 2 hours I recognized that that my back was sweated.

293
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:05,330
But I am too much a sweating person, I am not a water drinker.  I don't drink water.

294
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,900
- That means you don't like the water.
- Probably.

295
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,090
- You don't need it. But do you drink tea, or drink coffee?

296
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:19,740
- Every day in the morning I drink one or two teas between 9 and 10.

297
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:31,110
And around 11 I drink one café latte Arabia, not Turkish coffee, nescafe.

298
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,690
- But if you do homeopathy you stop coffee.

299
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:42,070
- Yes, I know. I can stop coffee. It is not a big thing. I can drink tea.

300
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:49,210
And I am drinking juice. Apple juice, orange juice, all juices I like.

301
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:59,600
I can't drink water, I can drink like one third of the glass...

302
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:07,590
- Why?
 - No I don't like to drink water.

303
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,560
If I am thirsty for example I go open the refrigerator, take the apple juice,

304
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:18,700
mix with the soda and drink this glass non-stop.

305
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:29,890
Apple soda I can drink. Cold milk I can drink. But water; one third of the glass.

306
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,680
Then I have to push myself to drink a lot again.

307
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:44,920
- But, except in the morning, do you drink other drinks during the day?

308
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,750
- Not much.

309
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,180
- But how much? Can you tell me?

310
00:39:50,280 --> 00:40:05,720
- Maybe a whole day from 9.00 to 21.00 I drink total 3-4 cups of tea but small glasses,

311
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:13,830
2 cups of coffee and one glass of water. Lately, the last 6 months

312
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:17,970
I am pushing myself to drink water.

313
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:24,990
For example I drink 1 liter of water one the table just to drink, I push myself,

314
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:38,610
I finish half of it. Because now I am drinking alkali water...

315
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:47,390
We have a special machine at home which produces alkali water.

316
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,660
I bring in the office but I still don't drink it.

317
00:40:54,220 --> 00:41:04,500
- Did you have an acute like influenza or anything with fever?

318
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:19,240
- When I was 11 I had a meningitis. I stayed 21 days, 3 weeks in the hospital,

319
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:29,400
it was like 3 weeks long treatment, they took water from the spine to start treatment.

320
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,930
Every day I was having 3 needles, injections, I remember this

321
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:45,080
and after three weeks she said it was in a very early stage,

322
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:50,700
when we started the treatment, therefore I was lucky I survived

323
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,420
because if I was one week late probably  I would have to live with side effects.

324
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:10,660
- Since that time you never had a high fever again? While you were married?

325
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,840
-No.

326
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,190
- Never?
- No, for 2 years.

327
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:28,530
- 3-4 years ago?
- No.

328
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:41,580
- Fever?
- No.

329
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:53,940
Maybe I got really one influenza last 5 years, maybe once I got influenza.

330
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:06,730
One day I was really hot but I took some strong medicine I took Augmentin,

331
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:18,810
I started Augmentin like 1000, for one week time, I didn't let it to get up,

332
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:25,320
I felt I was going to get it and I started early and it stopped the fever.

333
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:38,130
- So the last thing, the skin reactions; The upper part of the body around chest,

334
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:43,320
area reddish, patchy areas after exhaustion.

335
00:43:48,030 --> 00:44:02,680
- If I take a hot or warm shower after the shower it is here like patches and also exhaustion.

336
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:12,880
After the sex basically I get... 
-Altogether with the patches comes the exhaustion?

337
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:27,660
- No, after the shower and after exertion. After the sex I am getting patches.

338
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,530
- And you have condylomata/ warts at the surface of the penis.

339
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:46,710
- Yes, maybe 25 years. I had it since 25 years, maybe 30 years.

340
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:52,130
- Maybe 30 years and you are 40...

341
00:44:54,050 --> 00:45:10,250
- I don't know, I might had it after the first sex...  I might have it after the circumcision.

342
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:19,880
- At the age of nine you had the circumcision. And became a man...

343
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:32,280
- It's the culture. I don't know because I thought those small things,

344
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,930
I thought it was because of this cut.

345
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:40,250
Because they are cutting the skin goes up,

346
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:42,500
and at the side of the skin there are these small things.

347
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:50,670
I thought this is because of this. Because I remembered this... long time... I don't know.

348
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:58,800
Five or six are still there. They don't bother, no painful.

349
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:06,770
As a number they don't increase, they don't decrease. They don't go big, they don't go small.

350
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:15,480
They are always there. We are trying to think everything that is on the body.

351
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:28,200
- Yes, you gave a good case.
-Hopefully! Good but difficult.

352
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:45,760
- Your pathology is not easy. It appears to be difficulties. I want to ask something more.

353
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:50,950
When you were younger you would do dangerous things?

354
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:55,590
For instance, would you think what would happened

355
00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:05,240
if you put a kind of a steel in the plug, in the electricity, try to put...

356
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:09,370
- Not this but I used to drive very fast cars.

357
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:22,640
I took like parachute jumping from the plane, diving like 40m, extreme sports...

358
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:32,250
I think I will not die. If I die it will be fast, I don't feel nothing,

359
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:38,080
therefore I don't bother this kind of risky things, I would not calculate the results,

360
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:48,260
I would just go and do it. I did bungee jumping in a Greek island.

361
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,390
- You were not afraid in the beginning?

362
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:56,240
- In the beginning I was thinking I was afraid but then I said let's do it.

363
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,200
- I want to overcome it...
- Not like this.

364
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:06,440
I just didn't think of the results. If you think the result you wouldn't do it.

365
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,260
I was so stupid not to think the result.

366
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:16,710
You don't think because you are like 18,16... everybody does it.

367
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:27,210
- Do you sleep well? That means from the moment you fall asleep you wake

368
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:30,760
or do you have problems...?
-No.

369
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:36,720
If I sleep like 11 o'clock in the night I might wake up like 2 or 3 o'clock.

370
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,540
- With pain in the stomach?
- No pain in the stomach.

371
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:56,920
Either two things; if it hurts on my neck or my mind is busy.

372
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,120
This wakes me up.

373
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:06,760
Let's say tomorrow is Monday, I have things to do in the job like A,B,C,D I think at night,

374
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:12,710
I should not forget this, in 3 o'clock in the morning I am getting up and I am checking,

375
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:19,430
if there are things in my mind like brain checking... I am doing this.

376
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:34,990
Work is still important therefore anything that happens to work makes me nervous.

377
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,440
- Do you have any fears?

378
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:52,290
- Like certain things, health conditions make me nervous. Not a fear but makes me nervous.

379
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:00,100
Also, losing a job makes me nervous.

380
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:05,340
These two things; health condition, it's in my life for 2 years,

381
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:12,170
I'm thinking of what will happen, when we solve it, when we solve it, it makes me nervous,

382
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:17,710
I am thinking of it, the second thing I am thinking about generally is the job.

383
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,920
If something happens to my parents then I am thinking of my parents.

384
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:32,480
My father has a stomach problem. I think about my mother also. These two things make me concern.

385
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:41,040
- Are you afraid of the dark?
-No I am not afraid.

386
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:44,920
- Thunderstorms?
-No.

387
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:57,170
- The ice cream you like it because it is cold or because it is sweet?

388
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:10,460
- Both. But generally because it is sweet. In winter I don't eat ice cream,

389
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,150
I eat ice cream in the summer.

390
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:26,530
- You want to say more? Something we didn't ask you about?

391
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:30,260
- Not really... I think this is all.

392
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:54,790
One thing... during the day I feel tired after the lunch between 14.00...

393
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:59,520
- Suddenly you feel tired?
- No suddenly, but the energy level goes down.

394
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,950
-What time?
- After lunch.

395
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,120
- 13.00, 14.00?

396
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:10,750
- Exactly and if I have half a night sleep, or like we say... a nap.

397
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:20,820
This between 13.00 or 14.00, after the lunch and it goes down.

398
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:26,150
It also happens after the dinner, if I have a dinner like 18.00 or 19.00,

399
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:32,130
after eating the energy goes down and I feel like sleepy.

400
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:39,460
But I can sleep 20minutes, half an hour, it's like recharging battery.

401
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:50,420
One more thing... I cannot sleep if there is a light in the room.

402
00:52:51,100 --> 00:53:00,960
I close curtains, doors and windows and it is nearly 95% dark, then I can sleep.

403
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:08,090
If the windows have no curtains, if the daylight comes like 4.00 or 5.00 in the morning,

404
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:16,990
I wake up. If I am not drunk I cannot sleep during the daylight.

405
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,080
Or if I am very tired.

406
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:24,220
- You drink every day?
- I don't.

407
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:32,950
Previously, when I was a student I was drinking three times a week.

408
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:39,590
Mainly I was drinking vodka, this was 2 or 3 years of my life.

409
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:43,490
And generally I am just drinking in the weekend.

410
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:50,140
Last 2-3 years I am drinking maybe once in a month.

411
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:54,600
-Have studied anything? Or you went to business from...?

412
00:53:54,700 --> 00:54:02,170
- I studied economics. I worked and studied economy in Vienna.

413
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:07,930
This was also a tough time because , this was a stressing time of my life

414
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:16,870
because in 1992 the Turkish lira had a devaluation

415
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:27,140
because the economy has gone bankrupt  then I was studying in Vienna in the age of 20,

416
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:35,520
I got a phone call from my father he said devaluation hit Turkey

417
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:39,640
and he was sending me money he was sending like 1000 dollars

418
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:44,650
but after this time I will not send you I cannot send you 1000 dollars

419
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:51,770
because Turkish lira has crushed down, you either come back to Turkey or you work and study.

420
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:54,800
And then I started looking for a job, I found a job

421
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:59,880
and the rest of the 4 years I was living in Vienna I worked and I studied.

422
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:05,610
And when I was working, most of the times I was working at night,

423
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:09,360
I started working at a bar, I was working from 17.00 in the night

424
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:18,100
till 5.00 in the morning in the bar. Whole night. Then I came back home in the daylight.

425
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:22,550
Therefore I had to close the curtains so that I could sleep.

426
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:31,130
This was like 2 years of my life working and studying. I was doing night shifts a lot.

427
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:35,030
-But still during that time no problem with the stomach, yet.

428
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,870
- Very little.

429
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,560
- Some burning?
- Some burning.

430
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:44,260
But I was not taking regularly medicine.

431
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:52,980
If I had a burn, I was just taking maybe once in a week, anti-acid, after the lunch.

432
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:57,070
But very little. Maybe once in two weeks.

433
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:09,650
- But the problem that appeared during 2004 was a serious problem for you?

434
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:14,380
- Yes. Because this time I could not eat.

435
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,250
The time I ate everything was burning and come out in my mouth.

436
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:21,980
- I mean the problem you had with the job...

437
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,220
- Yes I was in Australia there was a problem.

438
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:29,030
- How big?

439
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:34,600
- I could lose the job and I could have gone back to Turkey.

440
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:41,900
It was a serious the job and the economic problem all combined together.

441
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,580
This was a highly stressing time.

442
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:56,310
But as I am looking now, during all my life, in the university in Vienna,

443
00:56:56,410 --> 00:57:02,880
I was really stressed, because I went to Vienna in the age of 18, my parents were in Turkey,

444
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,830
that 6 years I was alone in Vienna, 2 years were fine

445
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:10,880
but after 4 years the stress level was up

446
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:13,110
because if you lose the job you cannot finish the study,

447
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:17,360
if you cannot finish the study, you are going back to Turkey, it's a big stress,

448
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:24,610
I am the only son, it's not a good thing. Then I came to Turkey, 2 years it was ok.

449
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:32,680
Then I went to London, I took a job in London it was an international job

450
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:40,740
but I was the youngest in the team. There was too much stress as well.

451
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,190
I was the Turkish man in the U.K. company.

452
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:50,110
Therefore everybody was watching, 2 years of stress there, as well.

453
00:57:50,210 --> 00:58:01,850
What I am thinking stomach thing is like developing. It's like the last drop in the glass.

454
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:06,640
It's started maybe from the age of 20 and it's developed...

455
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:18,450
And in between, two years in Turkey it was fine, then a got again abroad, it started again.

456
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:24,600
Some time after 10 years , in 2004 it reacted but I think it is in the backyard,

457
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:30,140
maybe it has not started in 2005 but in the year of 2000.

458
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:40,970
This I think back my life... this is what I am thinking. Because I left Trkey at the age of 17 1/2.

459
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:46,340
Quite young, going abroad to study 2 years later, your country bankrupt,

460
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:51,740
you need to work and study, small stresses but there are some stresses.

461
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,560
-Ok, we'll try to help you.

462
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:26,970
If you take a case properly, you will always learn from each of you cases.

463
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:40,520
And you will be amazed after some years if you follow strictly the idea

464
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:44,110
of trying to find the correct remedy.

465
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:51,940
You will surprised how much you know about the organism of the people

466
00:59:52,040 --> 01:00:09,550
who are in front of you. So, is he a nice man? Yes. Pure heart. Open.

467
01:00:09,650 --> 01:00:15,940
No secrets behind, no mental aberration.

468
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:28,730
But the whole force of the disease is in his physical body.

469
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:48,810
So maybe you do not agree that it is because of the suppression of the acidity of the stomach

470
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:59,210
that he has such serious problems which are hernia and also the tumor.

471
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:09,250
But for me is very clear. This is what has happened.

472
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:17,890
You will ask anybody who takes that medication

473
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:28,430
and he has heartburn is he going to develop such severe problems?

474
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:39,920
The answer is no. Not everybody. But what is the difference?

475
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:53,150
Why somebody will have burning in the stomach, a kind of gastritis and uses this medication

476
01:01:53,250 --> 01:02:04,460
and will not have these severe side effects and why this man has this severe side effects?

477
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:26,850
Because... hereditacly. The heredity shows that his weak point, weak organ is the stomach.

478
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:35,560
This is the organ that will break down under stress.

479
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:51,430
How far can go? Maybe you don't know this disease; Barrett syndrome.

480
01:02:56,580 --> 01:03:06,540
Who knows Barrett? Only 2,3... Very strange.

481
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:22,110
It is a kind of inflammation of the inner lining of the stomach

482
01:03:22,210 --> 01:03:35,600
especially the upper part which is connected with the esophagus and creates ulcers

483
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:46,130
which they have the tendency to become malignant.

484
01:03:49,420 --> 01:04:04,590
For this boy who is very nice physical body has a weakness in the stomach which is severe.

485
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:12,760
If he's left like this he will develop cancer in the stomach.

486
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:20,600
In how many years.. maybe 12 years, I don't know something like that.

487
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:38,830
But will develop cancer, eventually. So therefore we have to know what we treat.

488
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:56,860
Otherwise I believe every doctor who is trained in a medical school he will be confused

489
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:02,180
with all this picture. He will not know what's going on really.

490
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:14,430
One is looking only on the tumor, the other is looking in the stomach,

491
01:05:14,530 --> 01:05:25,840
the other is looking on the ORL. See a piece of the picture.

492
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:39,170
And we look on the whole picture and also when we treat we treat the whole picture.

493
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:50,580
When you give a remedy, the remedy in order to be correct has to cover the whole picture.

494
01:05:53,540 --> 01:06:01,930
I will show you something and I will explain afterwards.

495
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:19,250
I want to you to show them the Arsenicum... in the repertory...

496
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:32,240
You see, if you go to the repertory you see his symptom,

497
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:38,510
he says if I drink milk the pain is gone.

498
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:46,260
What are the remedies? Can you see the remedy? Ars, asar and graph.

499
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:52,100
And the second you are looking in the beginning...

500
01:06:57,550 --> 01:07:14,750
Sweet milk. Pain with sweet milk amel. also yoghurt... yes kind of...

501
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:22,530
So you remember what he said when he took Ars?

502
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:31,650
When he took Ars the pains were gone for a certain period of time.

503
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:42,930
This is what we say it is a partial action of a remedy.

504
01:07:46,810 --> 01:08:00,670
Because you take a portion of the case, you don't realize is he an Ars case? Not really.

505
01:08:03,570 --> 01:08:21,460
The patient doesn't look like Ars at all. If you look in the repertory

506
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:29,320
and you prescribe this remedy this remedy will take away the symptom not the disease.

507
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:36,010
That's why the disease is the same, they checked it several times.

508
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:45,050
If the remedy was correct the stomach condition would be much better if not cured.

509
01:08:48,270 --> 01:08:57,710
- Just to make sure, when he got Ars 200CH, 30CH, 30CH it was for rhinitis

510
01:08:57,810 --> 01:09:05,780
or for the stomach pain? Maybe I didn't listen carefully but I thought it was for rhinitis.

511
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:19,400
-The pain in the stomach and the allergy. Both.

512
01:09:29,230 --> 01:09:37,590
Not the rhinitis, a discharge from the nose,

513
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:52,510
what he was describing was a postnasal discharge that was coming he had to spit it out.

514
01:09:52,610 --> 01:10:05,210
That discharge was cut off , stopped. Plus the pain for a period of time stopped.

515
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:18,000
That is partial action of the remedy. The fact that the discharge is gone is not a good idea.

516
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:29,000
If the rest of the symptoms remain. That means that the outlet the organism has, stops.

517
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:36,930
Therefore the remedy is acting partially because indicated partially.

518
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:54,580
- It's suppressive.
- You can say it, it's suppressive.

519
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:12,810
The origin of the problem is the stomach. This is what we have to see improving with the remedy.

520
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:25,960
If we improve certain peripheral symptoms and the basic problem remains

521
01:11:26,060 --> 01:11:43,090
that means we have not done a good job. Austria, do you agree? Yes, ok.

522
01:11:44,050 --> 01:12:01,130
Therefore the remedy is not Ars. The Ars has quite a lot of his symptoms.

523
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:06,890
What is the remedy?

524
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:18,610
First of all before we go to the remedy according to the theory of the levels of health,

525
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:36,050
in which level you will more or less place this man? That would be a good test.

526
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:54,320
Do you have a piece of paper and write for me the level which you think is this man.

527
01:12:56,730 --> 01:13:15,100
Just a number 1-12. Has everybody written down his own idea?

528
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:22,050
It doesn't matter if I collect. I saw more or less.

529
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:29,430
Has everybody written down? You are checking yourself, I am not checking you.

530
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:42,600
The pathology is chronic pathology.

531
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:56,960
Quite severe, not very severe, not malignancy, not absolutely life or death. One.

532
01:13:57,250 --> 01:14:09,340
The second is does his organism have the possibility of developing fever? No.

533
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:20,500
From 11 years old when he got the series of injections he never had fever again.

534
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:38,940
This fact should put him under level 6. Because in level 6 we have frequent acutes.

535
01:14:39,910 --> 01:14:46,780
Level 6 are frequent. Level 5 are not so frequent.

536
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:54,860
Level 4 yes, Level 3 is a quite good state of health.

537
01:14:56,150 --> 01:15:05,740
With one acute every year, every second year at the most.

538
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:18,710
But can you say this man is very healthy and therefore he has no acutes? No.

539
01:15:22,930 --> 01:15:36,420
Therefore the level which is correct to place him is level 7.

540
01:15:39,390 --> 01:15:50,800
Now I want to know who has written down 7. Excellent, very good.

541
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:06,590
The average is quite good, that means you have perceived the logic behind it.

542
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:22,830
Therefore your treatment, if it is successful has to give what...

543
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:32,290
the possibility of the organism to develop fever again.

544
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:42,100
He has stopped having fevers due to meningitis.

545
01:16:47,060 --> 01:17:00,980
The question will be if you treat this case can the meningitis come back?

546
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:09,180
Because we say that old symptoms are coming back.

547
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:22,750
You are tired, eh...? But can talk up to 12.00.

548
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:31,840
How old are you?
-30.

549
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:39,980
- He's 35.
- No. 44...

550
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:51,580
You asked if the meningitis can come back. The answer is no.

551
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:53,610
- The answer is no. Why?

552
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,990
- Because the organism will protect the most important organ

553
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:08,670
and the head is the most important physical organ and will not allow an aggravation there.

554
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:18,320
- This is a problem. I'll tell you what is my problem.

555
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:28,080
That once the possibility of the organism was taken away for developing fever,

556
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:35,150
the immune system is suppressed quite a lot,

557
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:49,160
that means something will come back if the treatment goes as deep as that level.

558
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:59,240
Will the meningitis which is an infection actually come back? This is doubtful.

559
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:11,740
What may come back is some headaches which may develop in the course of the treatment

560
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:17,930
reminding the headaches of the meningitis in the end.

561
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:29,960
They accuse us for giving remedies and it's a placebo.

562
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:39,610
They don't know that we have signs which guide us

563
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:46,260
whether the remedy was a placebo was a placebo effect or the remedy did a job.

564
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:52,330
Because a placebo would never follow this course, first the aggravation

565
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:59,260
then the amelioration then the pain in the neck will go back

566
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:08,200
because the last pain in the neck will be one of the first to go away.

567
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,750
The organisms starts going back.

568
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:23,240
And by the time the organism reaches at the age when he was 2005

569
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:31,830
he may have a partial aggravation of the stomach problem

570
01:20:31,930 --> 01:20:46,600
and eventually if the correct remedy correct potency then maybe by repeating the remedy,

571
01:20:46,700 --> 01:21:05,850
we don't know yet, may reach the point where he was 11 years old. What that means?

572
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:15,420
It means that we can bring an organism back to the state of the organism

573
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,480
when the organism was 11 years old.

574
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:31,360
That means we nullified all the damage done to this organism all these years.

575
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:35,420
And we renew the organism.

576
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:54,010
And give him the possibility to live many more years, naturally and in a very natural way.

577
01:21:54,530 --> 01:22:05,200
Not pumping the organism with chemicals and trying to control his mental state,

578
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:14,790
his stomach state and whatever and one organ breaking after another.

579
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:20,950
See the big difference between homeopathy and allopathic approach.

580
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:28,180
What is the remedy we did not say, eh?

581
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:41,170
You would like to write down the remedy that you thought.

582
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:47,030
Write it down don't cut the piece of paper.

583
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:58,030
Some of you, you may write I don't know. What is the remedy? Do you have a computer?

584
01:22:58,590 --> 01:23:52,350
Who has a computer system? What is your remedy...? No success this time.

585
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:05,280
Show me the symptoms on which you based the prescription.

586
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:12,590
Because I wrote down the remedy and at a certain moment she came to see what is the remedy

587
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:20,350
and then I looked at the computer.

588
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:37,130
Nose, coryza, discharge, postnasal discharge, paroxysmal sneezing, throat itching,

589
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:42,790
burning in esophagus, acidity of the stomach, pain-milk-amel.,

590
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:53,760
pain-burning, thirstless, condylomata. I don't believe that condylomata is condylomata.

591
01:24:53,860 --> 01:25:05,350
It's just some cheloid. It's a kind of cheloid, it's not really condylomata.

592
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:27,250
It's totally different evaluation. It doesn't matter. Put everything salt desire, sweets desire.

593
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:58,390
And if you ask to solve this. You see the remedy is Arg-n. You did not find the remedy.

594
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:08,540
Who found the remedy? Oh my god...

595
01:26:10,470 --> 01:26:16,230
- You were asking the keynotes...

596
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:29,080
-You are clever. By inference, not by knowledge you got it. Because I was asking keynotes.

597
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:34,890
Now I will tell you something else but you have to realize.

598
01:26:35,620 --> 01:26:46,290
I was asking keynotes mental keynotes of Arg-n. He denied them.

599
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:56,120
Just because he denied the mental symptoms it does not mean the remedy is not Arg-n

600
01:26:56,220 --> 01:27:02,930
it means that on the mental level he is well, he is healthy.

601
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:08,350
Mental, emotional level has not been touched.

602
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:11,090
You see the difference between the a person

603
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:19,550
who has not been touched in the mental emotional level how open and full of love and energy is he.

604
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:23,970
We have become ah.

605
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:30,450
With all these kind of anxieties, depressions and all these kinds of things.

606
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:43,100
And you see he is so open. But also the openness we have described it in the Arg-n case.

607
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:59,200
Has anybody taken  the e-learning? Who is taking the e-learning?

608
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:05,800
Go back and see the description of the arg-n

609
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:14,110
and you will see how much it fits with the openness of this person.

610
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:32,590
Feels very open and very easy to communicate and even to ask a stranger about a matter

611
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:34,610
which concerns him.

612
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:53,510
So therefore the pathology is fitting on this remedy but he is quite healthy

613
01:28:53,610 --> 01:28:59,400
on a mental emotional level and therefore you cannot get the keynotes I was searching.

614
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:07,830
Because if the keynotes where positive when I was asking I would come to the class

615
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:14,380
and everybody would say Arg-n. Fear from high place.

616
01:29:30,890 --> 01:29:38,610
I brought into homeopathy the idea of essences.

617
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:44,800
And I gave a description of the picture of the mental emotional states of the remedies.

618
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:52,660
As a result before I was back in Greece the whole world was prescribing on essences

619
01:29:52,760 --> 01:30:00,080
and prescribing only on essences. George said you prescribe only on essences.

620
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:05,540
That was a misunderstanding. I gave some information.

621
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,400
A little bit more information than what was in the book.

622
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:16,320
But I never said that you prescribe only on mental/emotional symptoms.

623
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:23,280
You prescribe on the totality of the symptoms always as much as possible.

624
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:28,590
But see here now something very strange.

625
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:40,590
The computer says and I say also before the computer Arg-n. Now I will show you something.

626
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:53,040
Out of 17 symptoms, Arg-n covers 7. Go to the next remedy.

627
01:30:53,140 --> 01:31:02,230
It says that the next possibility is Phos. Out of 16 Phosphorus covers 13.

628
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:09,720
And yet I say no Phos. Arg-n.

629
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:23,090
And the systems follows of course my thinking because I have programmed it

630
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:27,770
to think the way it think.

631
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:38,660
Go further. Show something else. Next remedy, Nat-m.

632
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:51,240
See 10 symptoms even Nat-m has more symptoms than Arg-n. No way. Nat-m is totally out.

633
01:31:51,340 --> 01:32:16,050
Go further, Med. 7 equal. Why? Because if you take out condylomata Med will disappear.

634
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:30,060
You see why it is difficult even for an expert even for somebody

635
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:37,070
who really knows quite good homeopathy it is difficult to come down to the right remedy

636
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:47,230
unless you have a global information. This is the main thing.

637
01:32:47,330 --> 01:32:52,680
You have to know the Materia Medica, as well. It's not enough, this is a tool.

638
01:32:54,850 --> 01:33:02,040
The best possible according to my understanding. But it's not everything.

639
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:07,780
That means if you don't know anything, you put the symptoms, sometimes you hit it

640
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:13,550
but you have to know really what are you doing.

641
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:31,260
So how much you learn... they gave a remedy already which fitted some partial symptoms

642
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:37,520
and the remedy acted by closing down the symptoms not the disease.

643
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:53,090
- In theory this is in C group level 7, so we need more than 1 remedy.

644
01:33:56,010 --> 01:34:05,480
In that case by your teaching I understand you're seeing layers.

645
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:10,000
Do you see more than 1 layer now?
- Yes.

646
01:34:12,410 --> 01:34:15,240
-That's a part I cannot understand yet.

647
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:21,240
The layers, the graphic, I understand everything but I don't understand in front of the patient...

648
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:25,540
-To see the next remedy.
- Yes.

649
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:36,740
- You're asking too much. Argentum nitricum will do quite a lot for his stomach.

650
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:46,570
You may not believe I will ask him not to take any anti-acids and within a week

651
01:34:46,670 --> 01:34:51,230
he will be able to eat without anti-acids.

652
01:34:56,670 --> 01:35:08,240
But still the organism will come back with a force because underneath there is another remedy.

653
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:13,770
Which is the remedy I am not able to perceive at this moment.

654
01:35:13,870 --> 01:35:22,520
I have to see the reaction and judge. Sometimes I may see most probably this is coming next.

655
01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:33,570
In this case I cannot say because I do not have information about the underlying layer.

656
01:35:34,090 --> 01:35:48,240
But we will see. And in any case the proof that his health has improved

657
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:56,880
and jumped to the next level will be the manifestation of fever. An acute with fever.

658
01:35:56,980 --> 01:36:07,020
The moment that you see the acute with the fever you are very sure that the remedy has acted

659
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:12,960
but you should not touch this fever with antibiotics.

660
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:21,940
With homeopathic yes, because he will have a big reaction.

661
01:36:25,290 --> 01:36:32,890
I don't know if it will be like meningitis but will be a big reaction with high fever,

662
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:39,800
with severe pain in the head during the fever. This kind of thing.

663
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:51,110
Maybe Belladonna type, I cannot predict. I took your time.

664
01:36:55,980 --> 01:37:01,120
- I don't understand well while you choose arg-n more than phos.

665
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:07,290
Because they are too open and... why did you choose arg-n?

666
01:37:07,390 --> 01:37:16,590
- Because for Phos there were contraindicated symptoms.

667
01:37:16,690 --> 01:37:25,350
Phos needs water and he has the opposite.

668
01:37:25,450 --> 01:37:35,060
He does not need water. Phos also needs very cold water. He never said that.

669
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:47,110
Phos as a child at least should nose bleedings. He denied.

670
01:37:47,210 --> 01:38:00,870
Phos should have some kind anxiety if there is total darkness. They don't like it.

671
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:11,220
So there are a lot of opposite symptoms for Phos though the openness yes it is correct.

672
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:15,990
Looks like Phos.

673
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:28,840
- He said after short sleep he is refreshed. That's Phos as well.

674
01:38:28,940 --> 01:38:47,010
- Yes, but catnap sleep , not the main sleep. Phos is very refreshed after the main sleep.

675
01:38:47,110 --> 01:38:54,330
In the catnap, not usual. But maybe, yes, you may see.

676
01:38:55,860 --> 01:39:02,520
- I perceive this patient chilly, in general.

677
01:39:10,530 --> 01:39:21,960
Interms of the history he has problems with wet weather and in the change of weather

678
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:30,850
he always used to find some problems. To me it's a chilly patient.

679
01:39:30,950 --> 01:39:36,320
This supports again Phos..., along with the openness, along with the sweet and salt,

680
01:39:36,420 --> 01:39:39,780
it is a combination of Phos.

681
01:39:44,650 --> 01:40:00,960
- You don't to tell me. Here it says, how many Phos, Phos has 13 symptoms out of...

682
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:03,030
but it's wrong.

683
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:21,010
What can we do? First of all he is not chilly. He can tolerate heat and cold.

684
01:40:21,110 --> 01:40:27,300
He said, if it is very cold, no problem if it is very hot no problem.

685
01:40:27,670 --> 01:40:36,560
So you cannot consider him chilly. Ars especially or Phos is very chilly.

686
01:40:39,740 --> 01:40:43,850
- He has a family history of stomach problems.

687
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:48,790
But in his lifestyle he didn't have much of alcohol or drug abuse.

688
01:40:48,890 --> 01:40:55,630
Did you consider his anxiety levels during his younger age when he had to work as well as study,

689
01:40:55,730 --> 01:41:04,630
as one of the possible direction why chose arg-n over the other symptoms of arg-n?

690
01:41:04,730 --> 01:41:22,580
- No. The moment that he says I want total darkness, the moment he says I don't like water

691
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:28,000
already the mind should go away from Phos.

692
01:41:28,100 --> 01:41:43,090
And the Phos anxiety if we take in sympathetic should be much more than he expresses.

693
01:41:43,190 --> 01:41:48,600
I'm concerned about my wife, but about my job also.

694
01:41:48,700 --> 01:41:58,930
So Phos is not a matter of just anxiety it's an anxiety about who is suffering.

695
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:01,550
That is his anxiety.

696
01:42:02,310 --> 01:42:08,390
He suffers, he's my relative then I'm anxious. Not the job, forget the job.

697
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:20,940
He is considered therefore it's not a Phos. Who prescribed Phos for this case?

698
01:42:23,900 --> 01:42:36,360
They don't confess, ok. The potency. What potency should we give?

699
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:43,300
Very low, low, high, very high, medium?

700
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:52,620
You can give up to 200CH without any problem.

701
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:59,120
You can give if you like 30CH every day, you can give even 12CH

702
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:05,950
but I think 200CH will be a good potency, only one dose, for starting.

703
01:43:07,780 --> 01:43:10,860
-Shall he stop the anti-acids?
-Yes.

704
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:15,700
Stop the anti-acids. Ok see you tomorrow.
