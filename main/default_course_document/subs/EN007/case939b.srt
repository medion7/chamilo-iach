1
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:25,456
This was a case of epilepsy that started in 2009

2
00:00:25,946 --> 00:00:34,666
and started after a conflict that the child was observing

3
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:41,307
and at first she developed cramps on the jaws with distortion of the face

4
00:00:41,582 --> 00:00:47,212
without losing her consciousness and during these local fits she can’t speak...

5
00:00:48,987 --> 00:00:55,387
Sometimes with retching, sometimes with reclination of her head and neck.

6
00:00:55,662 --> 00:01:02,572
Neurologists diagnosed Rolando Epilepsy. I don’t know what it means.

7
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:09,983
In 2011 a primary focal and secondary generalized epilepsy

8
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:22,783
and the EEG shows an epileptic focus parieto central left. That was in June 2009.

9
00:01:23,052 --> 00:01:32,293
She had received several remedies; Carcinosin, Stramonium, Ignatia, Helleborus, Sepia, Nux vomica,

10
00:01:32,783 --> 00:01:45,583
Tuberculinum, Kali bromatum, Hyoscyamus, Cicuta, Oenanthe crocata, Ignatia again, Thuja...

11
00:01:47,138 --> 00:02:03,270
So when we discussed the case we had symptoms, how many symptoms were used...?

12
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:11,226
Indigo actually was coming tenth

13
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:20,425
but it was chosen because of the peculiar aura of the epileptic fit from abdomen to head.

14
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:29,146
And because Indigo is a remedy that has given epileptic fits.

15
00:02:40,666 --> 00:02:51,663
Indigo was prescribed in low potency 12X twice daily, she was doing very well.

16
00:02:52,425 --> 00:03:02,426
The doctor had not seen her, only through the phone.Till now she had 3 epileptic fits, 2 in August.

17
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:20,346
When did she start the remedy? End of June. 2nd, 8th and 10th July and in November 2014.

18
00:03:20,857 --> 00:03:24,697
Before the attacks she had the same abdominal sensation.

19
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:32,105
Also sensations in head and jaws, difficult to describe,

20
00:03:32,623 --> 00:03:40,057
as if the blood vessels are blocked followed by a free flow of blood.

21
00:03:40,826 --> 00:03:51,305
It is interesting for this case to keep in mind this sensation of vessels blocked,

22
00:03:51,577 --> 00:04:01,306
followed by a free flow of blood. It’s a feeling like after running very fast.

23
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:06,665
During this sensation she is unable to think clearly.

24
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:17,670
She had a fall on her back and she was given a dose of Hypericum 30C

25
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:27,145
and she was told to continue with Indigo 15X and there is no other fit until today.

26
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:36,623
No stage of confusion anymore and she has pain in lower abdomen before menses. That’s all.

27
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:44,057
Otherwise you feel good? She did well in school?
- For the time being yes.

28
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:54,790
– What’s her position in the class?
– In the middle field.

29
00:04:55,066 --> 00:05:05,219
– Do you have any complaints for your health apart from the pain in the abdomen?

30
00:05:05,734 --> 00:05:16,944
– Recently I was quite often sick and weak.
– Ill with fever?

31
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:20,538
– It was feeling like fever but it was no fever.

32
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:29,744
I was just weak and when I was climbing the stairs I had to lie down because I was so weak.

33
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:48,063
– How many time did this happen?
– Twice but each time for one week. End of April.

34
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:52,172
– You did not go to school?
–No.

35
00:05:56,507 --> 00:06:03,423
– The pain in the abdomen is before menses only or during menses?

36
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:11,372
– It is always before menses starts and in the beginning after menses start.

37
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:18,783
– The menses are with a lot of blood or scanty blood?
– It’s rather strong bleeding.

38
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:27,503
– So the pain stops once the flow becomes strong?

39
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:37,146
– No, there is no correlation between the blood flow and the pains.

40
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:46,489
– Do you have black clots in the blood.
– No.

41
00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:54,169
– The blood is bright red or watery?

42
00:06:54,423 --> 00:07:02,939
- It’s just as if you have a cut and it’s bleeding. It’s not watery. It’s just normal blood.

43
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:11,853
– And there no headache or anything?
– Pain in my back.

44
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:21,824
-  When she felt ill she had headaches.

45
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:26,944
– But did you put a thermometer?
– 37C.

46
00:07:27,703 --> 00:07:37,345
– Very little fever. Is she still biting her nails?
– Yes, I do.

47
00:07:37,584 --> 00:07:45,264
I stopped for a short time, I tried to stop and I had success but now I started again...

48
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:39,578
Did she gain height?
– Yes I think so. Her shoes are 43.

49
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:44,182
– She is going to be very tall. How tall is her mother?

50
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:52,625
– She 1,76 cm and her shoes are 41. But her husband is...

51
00:08:53,659 --> 00:09:02,944
- The same height as me.
– She will be taller than you.

52
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:07,053
–The mother says her father is very tall.

53
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:12,173
– In her character she is ok now?
– I would say so.

54
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:14,982
– She is a nice child?
– Yes.

55
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:26,944
– In your class are you mixed boys and girls?
– Yes.

56
00:09:28,983 --> 00:09:32,064
– Do you like fruits?
–Yes.

57
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:42,573
–What kind of fruits she likes the most, soft and sweet or green?

58
00:09:43,063 --> 00:09:53,062
– Rather the ripe and soft, sweet fruits.
– Sweets she likes? She take a chocolate a lot.

59
00:09:53,583 --> 00:10:00,224
– I would eat chocolate but it’s not I feel a desire and would look for something sweet.

60
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:04,233
When there’s something sweet around I will take it.

61
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:10,092
– Eggs?
– Yes, I can eat them. It’s not a passion, not very big desire.

62
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:24,450
I don't really have a favourite meal, I like some sort of meat with sauce.

63
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:34,182
– When the meat has fat in it will she take it?
– No. I don’t like it.

64
00:10:35,462 --> 00:10:43,442
–In general she feels better in warm climate, cold climate, fresh air?
–I can tolerate everything.

65
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:48,542
There is no special climate that would make me better.

66
00:10:48,812 --> 00:11:06,946
– She has any fear? Fear of high places?
– Slight fear of high places. I do have it.

67
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:18,982
– I don’t really know if you could call it a fear but I’m stressed when I see somebody smoking,

68
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:26,146
then I get anxious that some friends or somebody in my family could start smoking.

69
00:11:26,422 --> 00:11:29,986
Then I get sort of panicky.

70
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:47,982
– Does she have any anxiety when there is a thunderstorm?
– Not really.

71
00:11:48,226 --> 00:11:54,382
– Fear of the dark?
– In former times it was more, now it’s ok.

72
00:11:57,575 --> 00:12:06,022
– In the time when she was really bad, it was strong that she would not stay alone when it was dark.

73
00:12:06,662 --> 00:12:14,103
But that’s much better now.
– Any other information from the mother?

74
00:12:14,622 --> 00:12:20,503
– Concerning the actual situation?
– The health of the child.

75
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:29,463
– I wanted to tell you something about these situations that she was slightly confused.

76
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:36,652
There were 2 situations, which were in November and December 2014.

77
00:12:36,902 --> 00:12:39,703
She was in school, she went to the toilet

78
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:47,383
and didn’t find the way back from the toilet in the school into her classroom.

79
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,503
That had never happened before. That was something very new.

80
00:12:52,780 --> 00:13:00,702
It wasn’t that dramatic, you exaggerate. There were the 3 rooms of Biology

81
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:07,662
and I ran out of the toilet and didn’t find the room.

82
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:23,022
– Tell me what potency she is taking now?
– 18X.

83
00:13:23,542 --> 00:13:28,142
– Twice a day?
– Three times a day.

84
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:51,182
– Continue to raise the potency every month. Ok, so no problem.

85
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:16,822
I don’t think we have to say much about the case.

86
00:14:17,662 --> 00:14:24,620
The only thing I can say is one of the accusations

87
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:38,942
that people outside have accused I never prescribe low potencies

88
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:49,702
and I never prescribe small remedies. Both these myths are destroyed by this case.

89
00:14:50,220 --> 00:15:08,902
The case is doing well. It is a learning process if you read the reports

90
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:20,422
you can remember the way she describes her situation you can learn something more about that remedy.

91
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:31,180
This is the important thing about this remedy. I also read the remedies that had been given before.

92
00:15:31,692 --> 00:15:38,342
Which were based in good analysis and repertorization.

93
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:48,062
Yet, sometimes, in small remedies we cannot get the remedy through repertorization.

94
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:58,615
You remember in the first day when Hahnemann in paragraph 153

95
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:09,622
he said pay attention to symptoms which are rare, strange and peculiar.

96
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:20,375
And this is the way that you have to look in a case.
Find the most strange and peculiar symptoms

97
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:29,742
and take them into consideration. This is the teaching for this case.

98
00:16:45,378 --> 00:16:50,182
You may ask why don’t we stop the remedy.

99
00:16:52,226 --> 00:17:01,702
As I said in the morning there are a lot of questions in my mind which are unanswered.

100
00:17:02,742 --> 00:17:14,502
So I am trying to find the rules and the principles concerning these cases.

101
00:17:16,055 --> 00:17:34,466
Another thing I can say about this case is that until she has an acute with high fever

102
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:43,182
we cannot be sure that with the least provocation especially with wrong remedy

103
00:17:43,702 --> 00:18:00,582
we can topple the case and have a relapse. Once this case develops a strong acute with high fever,

104
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:09,302
then from that time onwards the relapse will be difficult.

105
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:14,935
And then this acute has to be prescribed correctly.

106
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:18,102
Because it is prescribed wrongly,

107
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:29,702
this means if the acute is kind of suppressed even with homeopathic remedies then there is danger.

108
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:47,895
You have to be careful.
– I am a bit confused about the potency.

109
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:55,062
Because in the video it is mentioned 12C initially and then 12X or D.

110
00:18:55,302 --> 00:19:15,266
What was actually given to the child?
– 12D or 12X. Decimal not centesimal.
