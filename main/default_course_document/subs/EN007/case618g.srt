1
00:00:16,382 --> 00:00:26,622
What are the results? You had a test.<br/>– From yesterday.

2
00:00:28,142 --> 00:00:37,378
Yesterday I was in Vienna, in the clinic and the doctor made a list of the growing

3
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,778
and the weight of Nikola and it was normal.

4
00:00:44,782 --> 00:00:51,182
The normal is between 11 years and 7 or 8 months.

5
00:00:52,462 --> 00:01:06,050
And also the X-ray of the hand bones was normal, nearly 11 years and 7 or 8 months.

6
00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:12,942
– So what says the professor? Is he happy?<br/>– He is happy.

7
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:25,742
In the last control in December he told me that in summer we can stop the medicine,

8
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:43,170
but now he told me we should go on until December to take the medicine. For the next 6 months.

9
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:46,742
He told me it’s better for her to take the medicine.

10
00:01:47,502 --> 00:01:56,462
– He thinks the improvement is from his medicine?<br/>– But I didn’t tell him that we will come here.

11
00:02:00,822 --> 00:02:03,650
He cannot believe it.

12
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:06,210
– Has he seen another case like this?

13
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:12,862
Did you ask him if he have seen another case improving with a conventional medicine like this?

14
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:18,222
– The old professor didn’t work now. There is a younger doctor.

15
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,622
– The old professor is in pension.

16
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:31,542
– I think the younger doctor hasn’t seen so many cases,

17
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:50,222
I think Nikola is a very special case because she began before she was 2 years old.

18
00:02:50,742 --> 00:02:59,702
– Before 2 she had pubic hair, menses, and her breast growing.<br/>– It was quite a severe case.

19
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:20,450
And I remember the professor said...<br/>- In the very beginning when we came to the professor,

20
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:30,422
we were forced by the government to a professor for an injection.

21
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:37,342
He told me that he never had seen before such a young child with this sickness.

22
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:47,330
– But what was his prediction? What did he tell you?

23
00:03:49,378 --> 00:04:07,022
– He told me that in some years she will stop growing at the height of 1,50 m but now she is 1,53 m.

24
00:04:08,302 --> 00:04:16,770
And she will continue. Not so fast but she will.<br/>– So it’s a normal condition now.

25
00:04:23,662 --> 00:04:32,622
What was the last remedy that we gave you?<br/>– Last year she didn’t get any remedy

26
00:04:33,662 --> 00:04:41,342
because you said she was in a very good condition and she could make a break from remedies.

27
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:44,822
She got nothing.

28
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:49,422
– But now the same doctor said she will continue.

29
00:04:50,946 --> 00:05:04,022
Last year the doctor who saw her said... Last year was it the young doctor?

30
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:10,146
– Yes already.<br/>– You mean the same doctor.

31
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:14,775
– Yes, it was always the younger one.

32
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:20,662
– Only the first time was the older professor?<br/>– Yes.

33
00:05:25,506 --> 00:05:33,186
– But did you tell him at a certain point that you are giving her homeopathic treatment?

34
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:37,542
– No. Never.

35
00:05:40,622 --> 00:05:47,022
Because you always advised us to keep quiet because they are really school mediciners.

36
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:55,735
So it was better to hide it.

37
00:05:58,786 --> 00:06:05,186
– That is correct but I remember last year he said, 6 months more or something like that.

38
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:08,262
– From the hormonal treatment?

39
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:13,655
– He told me in December that we could stop with injection now

40
00:06:13,902 --> 00:06:17,986
but yesterday he told me it would be better for 6 more months.

41
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:25,175
– You had not stopped the injection already?<br/>– No. It’s not allowed.

42
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:45,382
I am forced by the hospital to make injections. Because if I didn’t they would take me to the court.

43
00:06:47,942 --> 00:07:00,742
– So she took Med. 200C, it was the first prescription in 2006. One year later, Lach.

44
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:10,466
200C, one year later Phos. 30C, 31C, 32C for 3 months. 2009 Lyc.

45
00:07:11,255 --> 00:07:15,862
200C and 2010 Nikola develops very well.

46
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:20,462
She is in general very good state so that year she needed no remedy.

47
00:07:21,495 --> 00:07:24,822
So last year we did not prescribed any remedy.

48
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:38,382
Until September everything went well but then the father realized

49
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:44,262
that she seemed so symbiotic with her mother.

50
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:52,215
What do you mean “symbiotic”?<br/>– She wants always to be close to her mother.

51
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:56,302
Symbiotic is not an English word.

52
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:06,786
– Attached to her mother?<br/>– Yes. Very close to the mother, only the mother.

53
00:08:07,575 --> 00:08:10,902
– And kept distance from the father?<br/>– Yes.

54
00:08:12,182 --> 00:08:19,342
– Without any obvious reason. She rejected him even when he wanted to hug her. Very strange.

55
00:08:20,622 --> 00:08:27,782
Was she manipulated by her mother? They are divorced.<br/>– They never married.

56
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:33,942
And the relation is still bad as always.

57
00:08:40,342 --> 00:08:51,586
– We don’t live together in the same house.<br/>– They never had a connection.

58
00:08:54,662 --> 00:08:59,542
I only talk with him or with her, never together.

59
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:10,542
And he told me that it was so strange; normally she liked him very much

60
00:09:11,575 --> 00:09:16,422
and always wanted to be with him and there was a period where she was rejecting him totally

61
00:09:17,186 --> 00:09:22,306
and it was so strange. He always had the impression that she manipulates the daughter against him.

62
00:09:25,382 --> 00:09:28,706
It’s not the first time he has this impression.

63
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:48,942
– Since 2009 in June, she hasn’t received any homeopathic remedy.

64
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:51,502
– Yes.

65
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:57,655
– In school it was going up and down in general,

66
00:09:58,146 --> 00:10:02,262
she has lots of quarrels with her mother concerning her studies.

67
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:15,302
Still she can have fits of rage, sometime ago she even destroyed a glass door. She kicked the door.

68
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:25,026
When did this happen?<br/>– I have only seen the destroyed door.

69
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:32,982
– Yes but in time. Was it one month ago?<br/>– It was 4 or 5 months before.

70
00:10:38,862 --> 00:10:49,102
– The last 5 months, did she have fits of rage?<br/>– Only with her mother.

71
00:10:54,982 --> 00:11:09,826
– How do you know since you don’t live together? She tells you?<br/>– Sometimes I see it.

72
00:11:11,895 --> 00:11:17,506
– When you are present?<br/>– He is in the house every day.

73
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:26,466
He lives 5 minutes away but he spends all his free time in the same house.

74
00:11:26,982 --> 00:11:29,815
He is in the house most of the time.

75
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:34,422
Only for sleeping he goes to another place because they live in his house

76
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:41,826
and he wants to sleep somewhere else.<br/>– It’s his house where they live.

77
00:11:42,342 --> 00:11:48,502
– When Nikola was born, I bought a house and her mother lives with her in this house and...

78
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:52,342
– He went away.

79
00:11:53,102 --> 00:12:01,302
He sleeps 5 minutes away by car in another house and when Nikola goes to bed every day, he leaves.

80
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:09,495
So he spends a lot of time with her in the house. But not as normal parents.

81
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:21,262
– Did she do anything aggressive except of breaking the glass door?

82
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:30,742
Did she throw things, did she do something aggressive, not as bad as breaking a door but...

83
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:35,862
Can you describe?

84
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:42,262
– She was crying, her mother was crying but no more aggression.

85
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:47,382
It was the first time when the glass was broken.

86
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,735
- She didn’t destroy anything else so far.

87
00:12:52,502 --> 00:13:07,342
– Did she hit her mother?<br/>– When she was younger but now she stopped that.

88
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:14,946
– When she was on hormonal treatment she was striking a lot.

89
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:24,422
It was when she started having menses between 2 and 3 years old, she was striking.

90
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:36,215
– When she was very young, 3 – 4 years old she was crying and had red head...

91
00:13:36,706 --> 00:13:43,106
- But was she striking, attacking, hitting?<br/>– Yes.

92
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:47,735
For some minutes, but then she stopped.

93
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:53,102
– But after the hormonal therapy she stopped entirely.

94
00:13:59,746 --> 00:14:05,142
– She weeps or screams, occasionally with more or less fits of rage.

95
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:13,062
She is snoring a lot. She had constipation.

96
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:21,506
And if she eats eggs, she has constipation?<br/>– Yes. Sometimes.

97
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:36,102
– But soft boiled they are ok. She likes soft boiled eggs?<br/>– Yes, sometimes.

98
00:14:36,866 --> 00:14:48,902
– Sometimes, not always.<br/>– Yes, sometimes she eats but not every day.

99
00:14:55,822 --> 00:15:00,422
– She gets nausea after sausages, especially fat.

100
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:13,222
She desires sweet and sour food and lots of salads. You talk with her mother...

101
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:22,702
- Seperately.<br/>– And the mother also talks about her having a lot of anger.

102
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:28,342
– Yes. The mother says the same. Sometimes fits of rage

103
00:15:28,855 --> 00:15:35,502
and for example when they have fights concerning her duties to do some homework for the school,

104
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:41,142
she doesn’t want to do her homework and so they have fights

105
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:46,775
and she doesn’t want and then she screams and so. And then she can get very aggressive.

106
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:53,666
She feels forced to it.<br/>– She is quite angry I can see.

107
00:15:56,226 --> 00:16:01,102
– But with me there are no problems.

108
00:16:02,902 --> 00:16:10,822
– He always observes that the anger is only at the presence of her mother. And not with him.

109
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:15,702
They are very harmonic together, very easy going.

110
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:29,015
– But I think she feels that he doesn’t harmonize with her mother.

111
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:35,415
– She has the feeling of a tension.<br/>– She feels tension when the mother is present.

112
00:16:36,182 --> 00:16:48,982
She can have fits of rage, aversion to do homework and she thinks her mother does not love her.

113
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:56,662
– Yes. She says to the mother you don’t love me

114
00:16:57,422 --> 00:17:01,015
when the mother says you should study, you should do your homework.

115
00:17:01,782 --> 00:17:05,622
Then she says you don’t love me and screams.

116
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:14,306
– She doesn’t want to get advised, give explanations, has a total aversion towards them.

117
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:21,986
– This is the view of the mother. It’s her experience.

118
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:25,826
– It’s her impression.<br/>– Yes.

119
00:17:27,106 --> 00:17:34,786
– She is in a terrible state at this moment. I can see, she is so...

120
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:52,215
Ask her if she just wants to get out of here.<br/>– No, it’s ok.

121
00:17:53,222 --> 00:18:12,942
– It’s just the same.<br/>– She seems to be in inner despair. Like to explode sometimes.

122
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:23,942
Has even the tendency to throw things around, to beat at things or herself on her head.

123
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:31,622
– The mother is saying this.

124
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:42,902
– Sometimes she screams while let herself falling on the floor and knocks herself around.

125
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:55,426
Do you know if she talks in her sleep?<br/>– When she was younger she did sometimes.

126
00:18:56,462 --> 00:19:13,102
– Nightmares?<br/>– Sometimes when she was younger she told about dolphins in her dreams

127
00:19:15,906 --> 00:19:21,815
and she was talking in the night about dolphins etc.

128
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:27,182
– She spoke in the night, in the dream? Or that was happening in the daytime.

129
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:36,662
– No in her fantasy.<br/>– She is impatient.

130
00:19:39,462 --> 00:19:47,142
She sweats a lot on her head. She is hot and has a strong desire for cooling down herself.

131
00:19:48,182 --> 00:19:54,306
She loves water. Ask her if she wants to have a shower,

132
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:59,942
if she can stand the shower over her head and the water running.

133
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:05,826
– Cold water?<br/>– No, it doesn’t matter.

134
00:20:14,542 --> 00:20:21,702
– It’s ok.<br/>– I have the impression the first thing she wants to do is to go to the pool.

135
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:29,382
She always wants to be in the water. And she also likes the shower over her head.

136
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:36,822
– Is she afraid of anything? Does she have any fear?<br/>– Thunderstorm.

137
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:52,942
– Dark? – When she has to go out in the night to do something...

138
00:20:53,975 --> 00:20:58,306
- But in order to sleep, she doesn’t need light in her room.

139
00:21:00,102 --> 00:21:11,382
When she was younger, she needed light in the room.<br/>– Yes.

140
00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:17,015
When she was younger she needed the light.

141
00:21:19,822 --> 00:21:26,982
– She sees bad dreams, has nightmares?<br/>– No.

142
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:31,586
– She remembers her dreams?<br/>– Sometimes but not often.

143
00:21:37,222 --> 00:21:42,102
– Usually she feels more the cold or the heat?

144
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:54,902
Is she aggravated by hot weather or by cold weather?<br/>– She loves hot and cold weather. Both.

145
00:21:55,415 --> 00:22:01,026
– Her feet usually are cold, normal or hot? <br/>– Normally warm.

146
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:28,422
– She has constipation and most probably she has hemorrhoids because there is blood in the stool.

147
00:22:29,702 --> 00:22:37,382
– They are rare but sometimes there is blood in the stool.

148
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:49,666
But I think that it comes from the fact that she goes to the toilet once every 3 or 4 days,

149
00:22:52,502 --> 00:22:58,902
or sometimes 5 days. I think it’s constipation.

150
00:22:59,662 --> 00:23:08,102
– Ask her if she is perspiring during her sleep around her neck.

151
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:20,142
– No.<br/>– Her self-confidence can be good or bad.

152
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:26,022
But she is doing things by herself more than before.

153
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:30,382
With her friends she has less conflicts in the meanwhile

154
00:23:30,902 --> 00:23:39,095
she is still lazy only doing absolutely the minimum. Her nose is mostly blocked.

155
00:23:47,542 --> 00:24:04,695
How is the pubic hair?<br/>– In the last year it is growing. Not strongly.

156
00:24:09,302 --> 00:24:25,175
– Have you noticed a special interest in flirting with boys?<br/>– I think so.

157
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:39,502
Sometimes she is playing with boys, especially with her friends.

158
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:46,422
I think she likes to play with boys but also with girls.

159
00:24:48,982 --> 00:25:01,506
– But have you noticed any sexual tendency?<br/>– No, not until now.

160
00:25:02,295 --> 00:25:06,382
– Masturbation?<br/>– I cannot tell.

161
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:13,302
– Only when she was very young, 2 years old she masturbated.

162
00:25:14,062 --> 00:25:18,422
– You did not ask her mother.

163
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:29,942
– I asked in general if the development is normal from this side and she said yes,

164
00:25:30,702 --> 00:25:53,222
it is normal, she doesn’t know any more. If this question is very important we can now phone her.

165
00:26:11,662 --> 00:26:26,775
– This is not so much important. Most probably yes, she is having some sexual development now again.

166
00:26:27,542 --> 00:26:40,066
I can see. She is mentally and emotionally disturbed because of that.

167
00:26:43,142 --> 00:26:50,306
Do you know if she is jealous?<br/>– Yes.

168
00:26:54,935 --> 00:27:08,502
When we go together and if I meet some friends she says let’s go now, be with me, not with the others.

169
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:19,255
– What did you ask her?<br/>– If she likes to stay here or not.

170
00:27:21,026 --> 00:27:35,382
She likes to stay here.<br/>– No she is calmer. I can see it. Before she was really angry.

171
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:47,142
– She is a typical young lady.<br/>– I don’t know.

172
00:27:55,862 --> 00:28:08,142
She still likes dancing?<br/>– Singing and dancing. Sometimes she sings more than dancing.

173
00:28:12,502 --> 00:28:20,182
– She used to snore in the very beginning.<br/>– Yes.

174
00:28:20,695 --> 00:28:29,655
– Heavily. She is still snoring.

175
00:28:31,942 --> 00:28:39,622
I think it depends on her teeth because the upper jaw is smaller than the lower jaw

176
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:49,346
and I made her some orthodontics regulation for nearly 4,5 years.

177
00:28:50,626 --> 00:28:58,306
– Do you know if she grinds her teeth in her sleep?<br/>– No.

178
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:05,986
– Because she wears this, you cannot see it.

179
00:29:08,055 --> 00:29:16,742
– No, if she doesn’t wear the orthodontic, she doesn’t grind.

180
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:40,382
– I don’t understand, if she wears the orthodontic device does she grind her teeth or not?

181
00:29:41,143 --> 00:29:42,942
– She does not.

182
00:29:43,462 --> 00:29:51,142
– If she does not wear it?<br/>– She also doesn’t. She doesn’t grind her teeth at all.

183
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:04,702
– If I wouldn’t have done orthodontic treat there would be a very prominent upper jaw.

184
00:30:05,982 --> 00:30:08,542
But now it is normal.

185
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:52,582
– Is her mother a scientist?<br/>– She is a secretary. She works in real estate.

186
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,663
– She hasn’t studied in the university.<br/>– No.

187
00:30:57,452 --> 00:31:02,060
– But she has a very strong personality.<br/>– Yes, sometimes.

188
00:31:02,822 --> 00:31:22,782
Sometimes her self-esteem is very low. But on the other side she is very aggressive.

189
00:31:25,612 --> 00:31:28,940
– She hit you?<br/>– No.

190
00:31:34,822 --> 00:31:43,782
– Have you seen her striking her hand on the wall?<br/>– No I haven’t seen it,

191
00:31:44,812 --> 00:31:54,540
but I thought if she would become angrier she would but it didn’t happen.

192
00:31:55,302 --> 00:32:14,743
But this happened short time ago. Yesterday when we were in Vienna she was stung by a bee.

193
00:32:19,622 --> 00:32:22,182
No reaction.

194
00:32:23,212 --> 00:32:29,100
– Of course we didn’t give anything.<br/>– Ok. Thank you.

195
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:37,292
It is a quite serious condition

196
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:46,502
and I don’t know why the government feels that this condition has to be treated

197
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,583
otherwise the parents go to the court.

198
00:32:52,902 --> 00:33:08,780
Anyhow this child was doing impressively well under the homeopathic treatment

199
00:33:09,292 --> 00:33:21,580
and also the hormones to the extent that last year the doctor who measured the development said that

200
00:33:22,342 --> 00:33:26,182
most probably she could stop the hormones

201
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:35,660
otherwise I think the hormones would continue for years maybe, I don’t know how many.

202
00:33:36,663 --> 00:33:40,262
– She started the hormones when she was 3, now she is 9.

203
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:44,620
For the last 6 years she was under hormonal therapy.

204
00:33:45,382 --> 00:33:53,303
– For how many years normally...<br/>- It depends on the case, on how severe the case is.

205
00:33:53,822 --> 00:33:59,703
This case was very severe because she had menses since she was 2.

206
00:34:05,612 --> 00:34:09,452
– The hormonal disturbance was very severe.

207
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:19,692
– Normally they stop the allopathic treatment when the girl is ready to enter puberty.

208
00:34:20,702 --> 00:34:24,542
About 11, 12 years.

209
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:37,862
You stop the hormonal treatment and you hope that the system is not totally destroyed

210
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,702
and she would develop normally.

211
00:34:50,263 --> 00:35:00,012
– My evaluation Is that she was doing quite well until 2 years ago

212
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:09,463
when she received the last remedy and last year she was doing so well

213
00:35:11,262 --> 00:35:18,743
as the professor who was attending her case said that she would continue the hormonal therapy

214
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,580
for a few more months and then she would stop.

215
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:27,980
The interesting thing is that she received no more homeopathic remedy

216
00:35:28,983 --> 00:35:37,943
and it appears to me that there is a regression in the case for several reasons.

217
00:35:41,542 --> 00:35:58,942
You understand the regression? Because she started having the psychological state

218
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:08,422
which she had when she was 2 years old, with the fits of anger. That’s the one.

219
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:24,542
The second is the growing of the pubic hair. The aggression because of the hormonal disturbance

220
00:36:25,303 --> 00:36:30,700
and also the growing of the pubic hair shows that

221
00:36:31,462 --> 00:36:45,542
the good development we could see last year is not there anymore.

222
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:55,262
This year we can see a regression that means we see a picture of her condition

223
00:36:56,023 --> 00:37:03,212
when she was 2 years old, only not as severe as then.

224
00:37:04,983 --> 00:37:14,220
The picture tends to be similar to the 2 year old picture, with the explosions,

225
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:19,340
the rage and the growing of the pubic hair.

226
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:38,263
There definitely is an environmental factor which is important in the case

227
00:37:38,782 --> 00:37:47,223
that means she has some kind of antagonism with her mother because of reasons everybody understands

228
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,252
and what I wanted to understand

229
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:07,703
and he can tell he said there was a period when she was attached to her mother.

230
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,543
Which was that period exactly?

231
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:31,782
– This was last year in September, October so she was very fixed to the mother .

232
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,492
- This is an important information.

233
00:38:43,302 --> 00:38:47,142
Why is it important, can anybody tell me?

234
00:38:49,943 --> 00:39:02,743
September, October last year she was in very good terms with her mother.

235
00:39:05,822 --> 00:39:20,422
What is the reason for this? She has always been against her mother.

236
00:39:22,732 --> 00:39:35,262
Why was she against her mother? Because she felt like a woman, an antagonistic woman instinctively.

237
00:39:38,092 --> 00:39:54,732
She was against another woman who is taking away her lover who is the father. It is very obvious.

238
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:03,692
So she is against the mother. She wanted to hit the mother, kill the mother, destroy the mother.

239
00:40:04,183 --> 00:40:10,092
Understood. Suddenly she becomes friendly with her.

240
00:40:10,583 --> 00:40:23,142
Why?<br/>– I think she became the 2 year old girl when she was close to her mother,

241
00:40:23,902 --> 00:40:36,972
like a 2 year old girl would be.<br/>– I think it is an emotional improvement.

242
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:45,932
This year 2010 is a good year from any point of view; physical and emotional.

243
00:40:46,423 --> 00:40:51,052
I think the remedy has also worked on these levels.

244
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:58,732
– This is correct but you could say it more clearly.

245
00:41:01,022 --> 00:41:11,532
By September, October the hormonal changes were so good

246
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:22,263
that there was no imbalance producing the female hormone to such an extent.

247
00:41:22,782 --> 00:41:29,943
Therefore she is not a grown-up woman anymore who sexually understands things.

248
00:41:30,462 --> 00:41:35,063
She stops understanding this and she becomes a child of her age.

249
00:41:35,582 --> 00:41:41,740
That was the best point in the development of her case.

250
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,182
Later on, she starts fighting again with her mother.

251
00:41:52,222 --> 00:41:58,103
Therefore we have to conclude that the hormonal treatment

252
00:41:58,892 --> 00:42:06,060
that was continuing was doing damage to this organism.

253
00:42:08,102 --> 00:42:15,262
If they had stopped giving the hormones the child would be totally normal.

254
00:42:15,782 --> 00:42:22,942
At this moment due to the hormonal treatment they brought back an imbalance

255
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:29,862
which is the opposite of what the treatment is aiming at.

256
00:42:32,172 --> 00:42:43,180
She becomes a grown-up woman again who is antagonistic with her mother.

257
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:58,263
Unless we evaluate these things we cannot understand and advise what to do.

258
00:43:00,062 --> 00:43:09,022
Therefore the hormonal treatment is doing damage from now on to that child.

259
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:32,823
And by disturbing the hormones the child feels at a state of anger all the time

260
00:43:34,103 --> 00:43:38,220
like she was in the beginning of consultation. You saw her.

261
00:43:40,262 --> 00:43:46,903
You saw how she was disturbed and leave me alone.

262
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:54,342
You didn’t see maybe but I was close and I could see more clearly. But this was her condition.

263
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:23,532
Therefore I consider this as a kind of relapse of the beginning of the case.

264
00:44:23,782 --> 00:44:32,492
If she is left without any homeopathic medication this condition will grow more and more

265
00:44:33,502 --> 00:44:40,422
and they will not realize that the hormones they are giving are bringing the opposite result.

266
00:44:42,982 --> 00:44:49,132
The treatment she took for 3 years brought her to the best possible state

267
00:44:50,142 --> 00:45:00,542
where her hormones were really balanced and became a child who loves her mother, naturally.

268
00:45:01,058 --> 00:45:06,690
It’s not another woman against whom she has to fight.

269
00:45:07,702 --> 00:45:14,862
The moment that the female hormones are in a much increased state

270
00:45:16,418 --> 00:45:27,938
then the mother becomes a symbol of an antagonist and then she will fight and kick the door etc.

271
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:50,702
What will we do?<br/>– Stop the hormonal therapy.

272
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:59,938
– We have to treat the professor.<br/>– The professor doesn’t know.

273
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:05,822
They have a protocol, they don’t evaluate, and they don’t know how to evaluate.

274
00:46:07,102 --> 00:46:10,690
They have a protocol and the protocol says you have to take so many years of treatment.

275
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:20,418
You have to continue. Why the professor said you have to continue? That’s another question.

276
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:29,102
Last year the same professor said wait, most probably we finish, we don’t need anymore.

277
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:35,502
This year the professor says I see some signs of regression.

278
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:42,178
You see how things are fitting together.

279
00:46:44,222 --> 00:46:55,222
That means the professor saw a kind of relapse in the growing of whatever they measure.

280
00:46:57,262 --> 00:47:05,982
And then they said I made a mistake last year I told you to stop, you have to continue.

281
00:47:08,022 --> 00:47:14,422
This is correct, he is a good professor from the point of view of conventional medicine.

282
00:47:15,182 --> 00:47:24,662
He is careful; he observes things are not going well anymore like last year.

283
00:47:25,698 --> 00:47:30,302
Now I see some bad signs so I’d better continue.

284
00:47:31,822 --> 00:47:45,822
He does not realize because he does not know that the result was not because of his treatment, it was in spite of his treatment.

285
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:59,660
That means the treatment overcame the injections.

286
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:13,740
– On Tuesday when I will go home I will phone to the professor

287
00:48:15,262 --> 00:48:18,092
and tell him that Nikola doesn’t like the injections.

288
00:48:27,543 --> 00:48:32,940
– He wants to tell the professor that Nikola doesn’t want to have the medication anymore.

289
00:48:38,658 --> 00:48:45,570
– Maybe it can work.<br/>But the injection is given in the hospital?

290
00:48:47,342 --> 00:49:10,382
– I give it every 28 days.<br/>– He is forced to do it.

291
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:10,018
The father is forced to give her the injection. From his point of view he wouldn’t do it.

292
00:49:12,062 --> 00:49:35,342
But he must do it because of the law.<br/>– This is not my job. He can decide whatever.

293
00:49:35,862 --> 00:49:45,090
This is my analysis, after that he is a doctor and he knows better.

294
00:49:47,902 --> 00:50:00,942
What I have to say is that the remedy which is indicated at this moment is Stramonium.

295
00:50:10,422 --> 00:50:27,582
I will show this.The first is Tarent., Stram., Lyc., Hyos., Staph., Bell., Tub.

296
00:50:35,502 --> 00:50:43,458
Why I prescribe Stram.

297
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:58,050
It is because the very beginning of her state as they described to me was a picture of Stram.

298
00:50:58,818 --> 00:51:01,102
which is coming back now.

299
00:51:01,622 --> 00:51:09,302
The aggressiveness, the grinding of the teeth, the whole picture,

300
00:51:09,822 --> 00:51:18,262
the darkness of which she was afraid etc. For me this is a relapse of the original state.

301
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:24,418
If this stays without homeopathic remedy

302
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:30,818
and they keep on giving the hormones she will have a severe relapse.

303
00:51:35,938 --> 00:51:46,422
– The first remedy was Med.But you also considered Stram.<br/>– I don’t remember.

304
00:51:50,018 --> 00:51:55,138
Now the way that they describe so clearly the original case...

305
00:51:57,182 --> 00:52:01,782
The problem is now that they did not come with the original case.

306
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:10,222
They came under the medicine, the hormones,

307
00:52:10,742 --> 00:52:22,782
so I did not have the aggressiveness that much then I took into consideration the present symptoms

308
00:52:24,062 --> 00:52:29,740
which were under the hormones and gave Med.

309
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:40,492
But if she had come without any hormones I would have given Stram.

310
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:47,660
straightaway. Now she is like starting all over again.

311
00:52:49,452 --> 00:53:00,460
That’s why I say if she is left without the homeopathic treatment she will go into a deep relapse.

312
00:53:05,303 --> 00:53:14,782
– What is also very interesting for me is that the state

313
00:53:15,302 --> 00:53:19,660
when she was very close to the mother in September you considered it the best state

314
00:53:20,172 --> 00:53:25,542
but for me it was interesting that the father mentioned that for him it was very strange.

315
00:53:26,302 --> 00:53:35,020
He didn’t see it as a positive sign.<br/>– But the father cannot evaluate the case the way we do.

316
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:44,742
He doesn’t know the facts.<br/>– But it was strange.

317
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:52,663
– Yes, also the father has his reasons to believe that the mother manipulates the child

318
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:57,783
and most probably she tries to do it

319
00:53:58,572 --> 00:54:06,743
but the reaction of the child comes out of the inner disturbance of the hormonal system.

320
00:54:08,023 --> 00:54:11,372
That’s why she has this kind of reaction.

321
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:22,892
The child likes to touch the father, likes to be the woman of the man. It’s obvious.

322
00:54:26,462 --> 00:54:30,822
Therefore the mother is the antagonist.

323
00:54:34,412 --> 00:54:40,812
But once the hormonal balance comes back she becomes a child who loves her parents.

324
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:54,103
– But I cannot understand why we cannot give Med. again.

325
00:54:55,142 --> 00:54:58,732
– I explained it but you did not understand.

326
00:55:00,012 --> 00:55:13,580
When she came in her original state she started having fits of anger and pubic hair,

327
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:22,540
they took her to the doctors, they said this is pubertas praecox syndrome

328
00:55:23,302 --> 00:55:24,823
and has to be treated with hormones.

329
00:55:26,892 --> 00:55:31,742
She had been treated with hormones for 3 years before they came to me.

330
00:55:32,503 --> 00:55:40,460
By the time she was taking the hormones the picture had changed

331
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:44,542
and the original picture was gone.

332
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:51,462
Now according to my understanding the original picture is coming back.

333
00:55:54,022 --> 00:56:09,382
If she had come in the original picture I would have prescribed Stram. The basic picture.And Stram.

334
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:25,260
would have brought back the child to normal condition without further need for hormonal treatment.

335
00:56:32,172 --> 00:56:39,852
This is a science. You have to realize it.

336
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:50,092
Everything that happens follows some rules and if you know them you can understand the process.

337
00:56:53,662 --> 00:57:04,172
Medicine today or the understanding of diseases is I got a cold and then I got this

338
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:09,292
and then suddenly I start having headaches, now I have chronic headaches,

339
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:18,252
now I take some Lonaryd, painkillers and then one day I start having fasciculations,

340
00:57:21,303 --> 00:57:31,302
I start having diplopia and then I start having numbness in one leg

341
00:57:32,823 --> 00:57:41,542
and then paralysis starts and you have now Multiple Sclerosis.

342
00:57:45,382 --> 00:57:50,502
They never connect what was happening before to what is happening now

343
00:57:51,262 --> 00:57:53,303
because they don’t know the rules.

344
00:57:54,583 --> 00:58:06,380
They have no idea that the organism is always one and doesn’t change.

345
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:16,898
It’s not an organism who has now headaches and the next day has another thing, epilepsy.

346
00:58:18,178 --> 00:58:27,650
It is a continuation. There is a continuation with acute and chronic conditions.

347
00:58:28,418 --> 00:58:36,098
Acute conditions can change and chronic conditions can also change.

348
00:58:38,142 --> 00:58:56,062
A person with chronic rhinitis or hay fever for years has this puffs they use for opening the nose

349
00:58:56,578 --> 00:59:11,170
because they cannot breathe and the edema is reduced until when? The edema comes back the next day,

350
00:59:11,938 --> 00:59:17,822
then again reduce the edema then it comes back then my nose is closed again

351
00:59:18,582 --> 00:59:27,022
back again with the cortisone until there is a time when the mucus membranes of the nose

352
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:32,930
will be dried up and become dead. They cannot react anymore.

353
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:38,302
But the original problem is inside the organism.

354
00:59:38,818 --> 00:59:45,982
Therefore he will bring it out on a deeper level.

355
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:53,410
Which is a deeper level? This is the uppermost respiratory tract.

356
00:59:54,942 --> 00:59:59,542
Then you have the larynx, the trachea, the bronchi.

357
01:00:00,062 --> 01:00:07,222
Suddenly it becomes chronic cough, take anti-coughing drugs

358
01:00:08,258 --> 01:00:20,022
and then eventually dyspnea, eventually asthma. So this is a continuation.

359
01:00:20,542 --> 01:00:27,970
You cannot say this is different than the original hay fever.

360
01:00:28,738 --> 01:00:35,902
It is the same hay fever which continues now on a deeper level which is the asthma

361
01:00:37,942 --> 01:00:47,170
and the treatments that they are prescribing are much more powerful now.

362
01:00:56,622 --> 01:01:05,582
It is very important that the theory which exists with Homeopathy

363
01:01:06,102 --> 01:01:09,698
should be taught in the Medical Schools of course.

364
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:18,902
How many cases would be saved if this was taught and people would realize

365
01:01:19,938 --> 01:01:22,742
that they should not do these things.

366
01:01:23,502 --> 01:01:29,902
You saw the other case that started with an eczema on the folds

367
01:01:32,738 --> 01:01:38,862
and then ended up in juvenile diabetes.

368
01:01:39,382 --> 01:01:47,330
It started with this! The same thing! And then from here went to the lungs.

369
01:01:50,382 --> 01:01:57,822
You press this inside then the lungs are inflamed, it’s not the skin anymore,

370
01:01:58,338 --> 01:02:05,502
it’s the lungs which are inflamed and then you treat this heavily,

371
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:15,742
you don’t allow this to express there and then the problem goes even deeper, in the pancreas.

372
01:02:22,382 --> 01:02:38,530
In the older times we used to have acute rheumatic fever as epidemics.

373
01:02:40,062 --> 01:02:52,862
Now many of such cases would end up with a cardiac problem.

374
01:02:55,662 --> 01:03:01,570
The mitral valve was usually collapsing, was eaten up.

375
01:03:04,382 --> 01:03:14,622
Mitral valve, problem after acute rheumatic fever. After suppression.

376
01:03:15,138 --> 01:03:19,742
If this was cured there would be no problem.

377
01:03:20,502 --> 01:03:32,542
But if it was suppressed the inflammation went from the joints to the heart.

378
01:03:34,062 --> 01:03:44,302
And they don’t realize. They know a cardiac condition after an acute rheumatic fever.

379
01:03:44,578 --> 01:03:46,862
They know because everybody understands that this is so.

380
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:50,210
The patient knows, the doctor knows, they write it down.

381
01:03:50,978 --> 01:03:57,890
But this is not taken into consideration. So when you treat a case like that

382
01:03:58,658 --> 01:04:05,570
and it is successful you have to expect that at a certain point of the development

383
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:11,702
while the heart will be returning to normal,

384
01:04:12,462 --> 01:04:17,342
then you will have inflammation coming back on the joints.

385
01:04:20,662 --> 01:04:24,502
And if you don’t know the rules what will you do,

386
01:04:25,022 --> 01:04:31,938
you will give again anti-rheumatic drugs and then back again to the heart.

387
01:04:45,742 --> 01:04:58,050
I had such a case with a woman who was not allowed to have a child

388
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:03,170
because it’s very dangerous in such condition,

389
01:05:03,662 --> 01:05:07,262
the cardiologists would not allow a woman to become pregnant

390
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:13,142
because it would press the heart and death can take place.

391
01:05:14,942 --> 01:05:21,342
I had such a case many years ago, back in the 70’s.

392
01:05:21,858 --> 01:05:29,538
A woman came with a heart problem and her doctor said she could not have a child.

393
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:35,662
She said I want to try Homeopathy to see if something can be done.

394
01:05:36,702 --> 01:05:44,382
So one of my students was a cardiologist who was already a professor in the university.

395
01:05:44,898 --> 01:05:52,578
He was an pathologist and cardiologist, 2 specialties, so I was teaching him Homeopathy

396
01:05:53,858 --> 01:06:09,462
and it was in his first lessons and I sent the patient to him and said can you check the heart?

397
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:22,530
He said her mitral valve is destroyed. What do you expect? I mean at this case,

398
01:06:23,542 --> 01:06:28,418
I understand you don’t realize how serious the problem is and

399
01:06:29,422 --> 01:06:38,382
that is why you send me to check whether she is better and I can tell you,

400
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:50,178
this case cannot be better. It’s a valve which has been destroyed through the inflammation.

401
01:06:53,250 --> 01:07:03,982
I said ok, don’t shout. I continued. 6 months later I sent her again.

402
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:13,982
She was feeling much better. Before examining her he said George, I told you.

403
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:20,382
Don’t send her to me because this condition doesn’t change. Finito.

404
01:07:20,898 --> 01:07:28,302
I said please make a cardiogram, look and tell me. He looked, I told you she cannot have a child.

405
01:07:29,342 --> 01:07:33,942
1,5 year of treatment, I sent her again.

406
01:07:37,022 --> 01:07:53,410
He calls me, he says I want to tell you that I cannot tell her anymore not to have a child.

407
01:07:54,178 --> 01:07:57,742
She can have a child. He couldn’t believe it.

408
01:07:59,298 --> 01:08:05,182
The cardiogram was normal and she could have a child.

409
01:08:05,942 --> 01:08:15,170
And she had a child, it must be now about 30-40 years old. She was 40.

410
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:25,662
– And the mitral valve was really better?<br/>– Yes, absolutely.

411
01:08:26,422 --> 01:08:32,302
It grew again to the extent that is functional.

412
01:08:33,858 --> 01:08:48,702
Why did this happen? Because the original inflammation from the rheumatic fever

413
01:08:51,262 --> 01:08:57,142
was transferred to an inflammation in the heart which destroyed the valve.

414
01:08:58,942 --> 01:09:05,342
In this condition there is not any more an inflammation with high fever,

415
01:09:05,858 --> 01:09:10,702
it is a sub-acute inflammation which continues to destroy.

416
01:09:13,022 --> 01:09:24,290
But the inflammation is there like in all active chronic conditions.

417
01:09:33,742 --> 01:09:38,370
This is an idea which is new of course in medicine.

418
01:09:39,902 --> 01:09:47,062
Which I have said many years ago with great restriction.

419
01:09:47,822 --> 01:09:58,338
I said to the class, I will tell you something which maybe appear to you as far too much an idea;

420
01:09:59,102 --> 01:10:07,298
that all chronic conditions are of sub-acute inflammatory nature. All.

421
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:20,098
As long as the inflammatory or the sub-inflammatory condition continues,

422
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:26,742
that means the chronic conditions are getting worse and worse,

423
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,862
there is a possibility for a cure, for a reverse.

424
01:10:34,178 --> 01:10:42,370
If the organ on which the inflammation is, is totally destroyed,

425
01:10:42,862 --> 01:10:45,422
then there is no more possibility.

426
01:10:46,702 --> 01:10:53,102
But as long as the sub-acute inflammation is active,

427
01:10:53,622 --> 01:11:00,290
there is a possibility that the inflammation will restore

428
01:11:03,102 --> 01:11:10,018
if the defense mechanism is properly stimulated, the inflammation is there to restore,

429
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:19,742
not to destroy. The inflammation is not something you have to subdue.

430
01:11:20,502 --> 01:11:26,382
The inflammation is the defense mechanism of the organism

431
01:11:27,422 --> 01:11:38,690
which says this is the best way to fight this invader, this morbific agent. This is the best way.

432
01:11:39,702 --> 01:11:47,902
I will bring an inflammation on whatever, on the lungs, on bronchi, tonsils etc.

433
01:11:49,698 --> 01:12:00,450
Don’t push me because if you push me too much I will give up on that level

434
01:12:01,462 --> 01:12:14,782
which is the tonsils and then the inflammation will go deeper into the bronchi and next time,

435
01:12:15,542 --> 01:12:25,262
instead of a tonsillitis you will have a pharyngitis, a laryngitis, a bronchitis, pneumonia.

436
01:12:29,102 --> 01:12:38,338
In the old times they used to say your tonsils have pus, put them out quickly

437
01:12:39,342 --> 01:12:47,298
and they took out the tonsils almost in every child. They also took out my tonsils.

438
01:12:49,090 --> 01:13:01,102
It was terrible, this is the defense of the organism and you take it away. It’s madness.

439
01:13:03,662 --> 01:13:07,262
Then the inflammation comes deeper

440
01:13:08,542 --> 01:13:14,178
and deeper and there is a time where the organism cannot produce anymore high fever.

441
01:13:16,222 --> 01:13:24,418
It is like an organism which is very tired and cannot really react

442
01:13:25,182 --> 01:13:31,582
but still is going on but in a much lower pace, instead of running and fighting,

443
01:13:32,862 --> 01:13:41,570
it tries to survive. This is the condition of a chronic situation.

444
01:13:44,382 --> 01:13:50,530
But as long as there is a process there is a possibility for a cure.

445
01:13:54,862 --> 01:14:05,378
This is a wonderful thing which is not understood in medicine unfortunately.

446
01:14:11,262 --> 01:14:22,262
Anybody wants to ask a question?<br/>– About Stram.

447
01:14:23,022 --> 01:14:37,102
that you advised, I learned that the patient can’t stay in the darkness,

448
01:14:41,462 --> 01:14:51,182
that is afraid of animals, of water, but when she was interviewed,

449
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:57,858
she didn’t say she cannot stay in a dark place or is afraid of water.

450
01:14:58,622 --> 01:15:09,378
– Yes. That’s correct. I said this is the beginning.

451
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:20,130
If you let her for another 6 months without a medicine she will go into the states

452
01:15:21,902 --> 01:15:26,262
where she will have more aggressiveness, more fears

453
01:15:28,062 --> 01:15:44,182
and most probably will have the pubic hair developing so fast… But it is the beginning,

454
01:15:44,942 --> 01:15:53,410
it’s like before a full case is developed in any condition.

455
01:15:54,690 --> 01:16:02,622
There is a process, a picture is developing more and more fully.

456
01:16:03,382 --> 01:16:10,302
Now she has not a full picture of Stram. as I said.

457
01:16:12,342 --> 01:16:19,502
But as it reminds me of the beginning that she had a full picture during that time

458
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:30,782
and as I feel that because of the hormones she returns back to the original disturbance,

459
01:16:31,542 --> 01:16:34,370
she is going to develop the same picture.

460
01:16:35,902 --> 01:16:42,542
It is like giving the correct remedy with the beginning of the symptoms.

461
01:16:44,862 --> 01:16:52,542
To prevent from the full picture. Very good.

462
01:17:00,462 --> 01:17:08,418
– I want to ask the father the name of the allopathic drug she took.

463
01:17:10,462 --> 01:17:13,538
– The name is Enantone.

464
01:17:14,818 --> 01:17:23,263
– And what is the allopathic mechanism of action? It stops the process of producing estrogens.

465
01:17:30,942 --> 01:17:42,978
– But in this case if the estrogens are blocked why she develops now the same symptoms

466
01:17:44,502 --> 01:17:57,570
like in the past when the estrogens were increased?<br/>– The estrogens are suppressed now.

467
01:18:03,702 --> 01:18:07,298
We took blood and they are suppressed now.

468
01:18:09,858 --> 01:18:13,422
– The estrogens are suppressed

469
01:18:13,942 --> 01:18:21,890
because the full picture of the original condition was not developed.

470
01:18:25,982 --> 01:18:38,530
The idea that the hormones will block the estrogens works in the beginning

471
01:18:39,810 --> 01:18:46,210
but now through homeopathic treatment we made this organism normal,

472
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:59,502
so we have now a normal organism; last year for instance September, October the organism,

473
01:19:00,542 --> 01:19:09,502
as far as hormones are concerned, was normal.

474
01:19:14,302 --> 01:19:22,498
We take a normal organism and we inject with hormones blocking the estrogens.

475
01:19:23,262 --> 01:19:36,302
What happens; in a healthy organism we inject some strong powerful hormones without any reason.

476
01:19:36,822 --> 01:19:40,418
The organism will react but you don’t know how.

477
01:19:41,182 --> 01:19:49,378
Is it going to block further, is he going to react the opposite way? This is what happened.

478
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:58,850
– Is she actually proving the injections? – She is proving the injections

479
01:19:59,618 --> 01:20:06,782
but she is not only proving because proving is not so deep disturbance.

480
01:20:07,298 --> 01:20:11,902
Here we have a clear deep disturbance right now.

481
01:20:13,182 --> 01:20:22,382
It is very deep disturbance it brings back the whole syndrome without any reason.

482
01:20:23,422 --> 01:20:27,778
Because of a protocol.

483
01:20:31,342 --> 01:20:40,302
And it’s so obvious that if they had stopped already last year

484
01:20:40,822 --> 01:20:47,742
when the professor who checked said it’s ok now, I don’t think she has to take anymore,

485
01:20:48,502 --> 01:20:53,622
if he had stopped the hormones the child would be normal now.

486
01:21:01,822 --> 01:21:10,530
– Another question. Will she develop this Stram.

487
01:21:11,298 --> 01:21:14,370
picture later in the future maybe or not?

488
01:21:17,698 --> 01:21:28,182
If this professor would give up the injections is there a possibility she will develop a Stram.

489
01:21:29,462 --> 01:21:34,062
picture in the future?<br/>- It is possible that after giving Stram.

490
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:42,018
and then she calms down and becomes again friendly with the mother etc.

491
01:21:42,782 --> 01:21:50,462
but if they continue to give injections most probably there will be a relapse.

492
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:56,862
And she will develop again the aggression and all this syndrome.

493
01:22:04,290 --> 01:22:11,458
– It amazes me that in spite of the hormones the remedy acted so well.

494
01:22:12,222 --> 01:22:20,142
But in other cases we must say stop, don’t take allopathic drugs

495
01:22:20,662 --> 01:22:24,258
because the remedy will not work. I don’t see the difference between these cases.

496
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:29,890
– Yes, that is true but there is a difference here.

497
01:22:35,262 --> 01:22:44,462
First of all when they brought to me the case I said...

498
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:49,090
I don’t remember the analysis, that was 4 years ago.

499
01:22:50,102 --> 01:22:55,490
Maybe in the analysis I was not so sure that we could cure such a case.

500
01:22:58,542 --> 01:23:07,262
The second thing which is related to your question is that hormones usually

501
01:23:08,022 --> 01:23:24,142
are not as bad as chemical drugs. Because hormones are natural products of the human body.

502
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:36,942
In a case where you have a thyroid problem and you replace with thyroxin,

503
01:23:38,498 --> 01:23:44,622
then you may still prescribe homeopathic remedy without reducing,

504
01:23:45,662 --> 01:23:47,702
and the homeopathic remedy will act.

505
01:23:48,738 --> 01:23:54,862
So under hormonal treatment is easier for a homeopathic remedy to act.

506
01:24:01,262 --> 01:24:05,378
– Don’t you think that what you call regression

507
01:24:06,382 --> 01:24:13,570
can be due to the approximation of the real puberty of the girl?

508
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:19,458
Her mother had a puberty at 10.<br/>– Good question.

509
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:28,930
I would consider it as approximation if she did not come back with the psychological state.

510
01:24:29,698 --> 01:24:42,742
The psychological state, the aggression in normal puberty wouldn’t be there.

511
01:24:45,302 --> 01:24:52,222
In a normal puberty also you will not have the increase of the female hormones

512
01:24:52,738 --> 01:24:59,138
to such an extent that she will become again the antagonist of her mother.

513
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:06,818
All these things give me the impression that she is in a relapse

514
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:17,570
which is pathological and not a normal puberty. Later on, after Stram.

515
01:25:18,338 --> 01:25:29,090
she may go into a normal menses condition but with a totally different psychological state.

516
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:36,770
Her psychology will be like a 12 year-old child, normal.

517
01:25:38,302 --> 01:25:44,702
At this moment the aggression with the mother and the antagonism

518
01:25:45,462 --> 01:25:55,702
and also the rage which is coming back again; there is definitely a regression.

519
01:25:58,262 --> 01:26:04,662
– Right now she is reacting to the hormonal treatment that she is getting.

520
01:26:11,582 --> 01:26:21,570
So that’s the allopathic intervention but will she stop reacting at some point and go deeper?

521
01:26:22,338 --> 01:26:31,810
Do you think if it continues?
 – It is going to be a terrible situation.

522
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:38,462
It’s already quite deep. The situation is quite deep.

523
01:26:39,222 --> 01:26:48,702
If that situation becomes deeper God knows what is going to manifest as the next pathology!

524
01:27:01,742 --> 01:27:06,862
– I just want to ask which potency Stram. and in which condition?

525
01:27:07,902 --> 01:27:16,862
Once a month? Only one time?<br/>– Only one time, 200C. And we will see.

526
01:27:18,658 --> 01:27:31,458
And repeat in case she gets better but then again there is a kind of relapse to the rage state.

527
01:27:36,822 --> 01:27:38,622
Thank you!
