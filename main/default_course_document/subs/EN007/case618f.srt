1
00:00:20,622 --> 00:00:37,782
This case we saw 4 years ago. The diagnosis pubertas praecox and received Medorrhinum 200C in 2006,

2
00:00:39,062 --> 00:00:54,146
Lachesis 200C in 2007, Phosphorus 30C, 31C, 32C each month in 2008 and last year Lycopodium 200C.

3
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:05,666
You say the process is very successful. The parameters;

4
00:01:06,946 --> 00:01:21,815
bone tests got much better so the original bad prognosis that the
child would stay small like a dwarf is not to be expected anymore.

5
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:36,142
And the doctors in Vienna are talking for big luck. So the present symptoms?

6
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:57,655
– The mother gave me the symptoms from last year and
basically she could not see many changes after Lyc.

7
00:01:58,146 --> 00:02:12,226
But she is not a homeopath so maybe she did not notice so carefully and these symptoms that
she told me are that she still catches colds very easily but now are only mainly in winter.

8
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:25,542
– With high fever or not? 
– Low temperature. 37C, 37,3C.

9
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:29,142
– And how many times did she have a cold this winter?

10
00:02:29,902 --> 00:02:35,022
– One time it took nearly 6 weeks. 
– And was continuous?

11
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:46,786
– Yes.
 – Sometimes she has temperature 37,5C and this stays for a long time, her mother told me.

12
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:59,095
– Mostly bronchitis with cough?
 – Yes. Sometimes very strong.

13
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:03,942
– Was the coughing more when lying down in the night?

14
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:16,742
– Yes when she goes to bed and laying so flat… but if she goes up a little bit more coughing gets better.

15
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:23,662
– With some pillows?
 – Yes, 2 pillows and then she was a little bit better.

16
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:36,706
– Her mother thinks that her immune system is weak from the hormones she still gets once a month.

17
00:03:37,495 --> 00:03:47,982
So what do they say about the hormones in the hospital?
 – The hormones are good for children.

18
00:03:48,742 --> 00:03:55,415
– Yes but do they propose something to stop taking the hormones?

19
00:03:56,182 --> 00:04:06,935
– No, but the young doctor told me we will stop next year.

20
00:04:09,222 --> 00:04:17,175
– If she is doing quite well.
 – They say the parameters are very good and so they are intending to stop.

21
00:04:18,182 --> 00:04:20,742
They think there is no need anymore.

22
00:04:21,506 --> 00:04:25,346
They will leave her out of hormones in the puberty, because she is going to be 10 next year.

23
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:30,742
– To have normal puberty.

24
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:37,382
– Yes. This is a good sign that they expect that she will have puberty again and this is not stopped.

25
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:46,342
And the bone parameters are all showing they got less so they are like a child bones, like a girl in puberty.

26
00:04:50,182 --> 00:04:56,855
– The bones of the hands, they make each year some X-rays and they are normal.

27
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:06,582
They don’t grow. 
– Before it was really scary. This is a big miracle.

I see her every 3 months and seems always a little bit taller.

40

I have the impression she got taller in the last 2 years.

41
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:21,986

129
00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:58,302

– No glass. Tasting. – A spoonful.

135
00:29:31,223 --> 00:29:47,102
– Her mother says about her that she is organized or very sloppy?
 – She is very sloppy.

136
00:29:48,382 --> 00:30:11,942
More this. I guess her mother will say the same. She is fastidious with her clothes and her looks but not with things around in her room… George,

137
00:30:12,702 --> 00:30:21,932
he told me just now that she can get very angry if something is not just. She can get angry.

 In the beginning, maybe you remember before Med.,
 she had heavy fits of rage.

142
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:27,782
She was always wild and emotional. 
– She is having normal stool or constipated, diarrhea?

143
00:31:30,903 --> 00:31:34,252
 – Her mother told me only every 2-3 days.

144
00:31:34,743 --> 00:31:53,452
More constipation. – There is odor from the mouth?
 – No. I never realized it. – She talks in her sleep.

145
00:31:57,783 --> 00:32:10,342
– I don’t know.
 – She is turning around.

146
00:32:11,622 --> 00:32:27,742
She sleeps quietly mostly but sometimes she is turning around changing the place. The school stuff is in order.

147
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:43,102
Not so sloppy. – The school books you mean?
 – Yes they are in order.

148
00:32:43,863 --> 00:32:47,703
Not so sloppy. 
– Ok.

149
00:33:00,012 --> 00:33:16,140
I don’t know if you know this syndrome. Girls having menstruation too early and they don’t grow.

150
00:33:16,902 --> 00:33:35,582
It’s quite serious condition with deep hormonal disturbances
and actually they have to take hormones all their lives.

151
00:33:36,343 --> 00:33:55,052
They usually stay very short. This case is going quite well actually. Has responded very well.

152
00:33:56,332 --> 00:34:09,623
An interesting thing when seeing the present state of the girl, you see actually a healthy organism.

153
00:34:10,903 --> 00:34:22,700
There is no something mentally or physically to indicate that there is still a need for a remedy.

154
00:34:23,212 --> 00:34:30,380
That’s why this time it was very difficult to discern the remedy at that state.

155
00:34:31,383 --> 00:34:52,382
Because the girl has come to a balance, mentally, emotionally. In the beginning she behaved like a crazy person, absolutely uncontrollable rage.

156
00:34:53,932 --> 00:35:02,892
Mental/ emotional changes. At this moment she is in a quite good condition.

157
00:35:04,172 --> 00:35:17,463
The best prescription for her at the moment is placebo actually.

158
00:35:19,782 --> 00:35:30,022
The right remedy is placebo. There are some indications for either Pulsatilla or Sulphur.

159
00:35:32,332 --> 00:35:44,620
But neither of the 2 is clear so therefore, I wouldn’t go ahead and give any remedy at this moment.

160
00:35:45,382 --> 00:35:49,463
I see she is going quite well and we’ll see.

161
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:56,652
Once she stops the hormones she is taking, maybe we can have a clearer picture,

162
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:10,732
maybe the next remedy will manifest itself but she is doing extremely well actually.

163
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:30,942
You saw me I was trying very hard to find some way but she is very good girl.

164
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:41,702
The fact that she throws things around and her looks go towards Sulphur.

165
00:36:44,262 --> 00:36:49,900
The desire for sweets also which is quite strong. The feet out of covers.

166
00:36:51,180 --> 00:37:02,700
Yes I was not happy with the full picture and I don’t want to spoil an excellent reaction which is going on.

167
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:33,420
With this case we have reached almost the end of our encountering. You may put some question if you like.

168
00:37:52,620 --> 00:38:02,860
– I would like to make a remark to this case. 
She is still getting the hormones but the hormones fit to a case which is not treated homeopathically.

169
00:38:03,372 --> 00:38:15,575
They fit to a case where a girl will be very small and now together with your treatment and the hormones she is getting much too high.

170
00:38:16,342 --> 00:38:24,535
She is already too high for her age. They should reduce the hormones.

171
00:38:25,542 --> 00:38:36,546
– I don’t want to interfere because they are responsible for the hormonal part, not me.

172
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:44,742
They have to decide sooner or later to interfere and stop the hormones.

173
00:38:47,062 --> 00:38:51,662
I agree but I cannot decide myself.

174
00:38:52,182 --> 00:39:00,866
– Of course, not you personally but I just wanted to mention the
hormones must be stopped otherwise she will get 180 or 190cm tall.

175
00:39:05,222 --> 00:39:12,902
– I believe as they already said, that they have to stop the hormones.

176
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:23,906
He said next year, maybe they will decide at the end of this year to withdraw the hormones.

177
00:39:25,702 --> 00:39:33,142
That maybe will leave a clearer picture for us, I believe.

178
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:54,902
We will see how the hormonal system will work whether she will have natural menstruation at the age of 11.

179
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:24,342
Anybody wants to ask? 
– Why don’t you just not give her a remedy? Why do we need the placebo?

180
00:40:30,742 --> 00:40:33,302
– It’s not a matter whether I want to give placebo or not.

181
00:40:34,062 --> 00:40:46,862
It depends on the doctor who is in attendance feels that they must have something or not.

182
00:40:47,106 --> 00:41:01,186
It’s a matter of being more calm they are taking something and the child is not left.

183
00:41:01,975 --> 00:41:12,215
The matter of placebo is an individual thing for the homeopaths to decide between the homeopath and the patient.

184
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:31,415
Actually because in the older times, one remedy, one time will be very suspicious for many people.

185
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:40,102
They say I came here, sat for one hour and you give me one dose and you say goodbye. It’s no good because of these reasons.

186
00:41:40,622 --> 00:41:52,662
I used to give placebo in every case when I was treating patients in Greece. Always placebo for one month. One remedy and placebo.

187
00:41:55,222 --> 00:42:12,102
And the results were actually fantastic. Second month if people still felt they needed a continuation,

188
00:42:12,622 --> 00:42:21,335
second month placebo, third month placebo, fourth month placebo and then I tell them don’t come again you’re good.

189
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:32,582
Some patients felt more secure to see us because we were charging very little actually.

190
00:42:36,182 --> 00:42:45,382
I said ok if you like to pay me every month come, but I tell you you can stop. So they decided to stop many of them.

191
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:59,982
Actually sometimes we had to ask them to stop and forget it and don’t come anymore
because they were too many people wanting treatment and we did not have the time.

192
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:11,255
So we had to tell them stop coming and come only if there is a real problem or something manifests.

193
00:43:14,062 --> 00:43:18,935
But these periods are more difficult with the pollution.

194
00:43:21,495 --> 00:43:28,662
Anyhow in this case I don’t say to the doctor to give placebo.

195
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:33,782
She will decide herself. This is up to her.

196
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:42,466
What I meant is that at this moment we don’t have enough information to give a prescription.

197
00:43:47,342 --> 00:44:01,422
Next question. … Alcohol desire? Sulphur.

198
00:44:02,946 --> 00:44:09,622
When children need Sulphur they like beer or anything.

199
00:44:10,626 --> 00:44:15,502
They would take a glass of beer and drink it, at her age.

200
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:22,422
That’s an indication for Sulph. Desire for alcohol.

201
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:33,942
But mostly beer and whiskey. Some they try!

202
00:44:39,822 --> 00:44:43,662
The desire for sweets is the same as alcohol.

203
00:44:44,942 --> 00:45:00,302
Either a lot of sweets are needed in the organism of Sulph. or they take it from the alcohol.
