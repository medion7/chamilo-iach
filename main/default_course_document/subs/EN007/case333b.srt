1
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,880
-So you have been quite anxious last time when you appeared here.

2
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,030
-Very much, it was so severe that I was not in connection with myself.

3
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:45,370
I was trembling and my heart was beating very fast and I was like an Opium state.

4
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:55,720
I felt so bad after the interview that I cried without stop, not right after

5
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:02,550
but in that evening, so I didn't sleep, I was just crying.

6
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:12,070
Then something very interesting happened. It turned into pictures.

7
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:19,890
-And you started having in front of you pictures of feelings?

8
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:38,890
-It was feelings, it was visions. The interview was in a way far from me

9
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:51,330
but it touched something very deep and it was the relationship I had with my father.

10
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:04,100
As I told you, my parents died when they were very young.

11
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,000
In the interview I couldn't cry and now I won't stop.

12
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:32,400
I had these visions, my father died 20 years ago and I had these visions of him,

13
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:43,150
very clear and very calming and I woke up very much refreshed in the morning,

14
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:51,740
although the sleep was unusual to me. Woke up very refreshed and happy

15
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,170
and I wasn't sure I wanted to take the remedy.

16
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:03,430
-It was like as if you were cured almost.
-Yes.

17
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,910
It happened before I took the remedy and gave me a deep inside about interview

18
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:23,980
and case taking and something I started to do Homeopathy this year every day, very intensively.

19
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,240
It gave me a very deep inside of the case taking and what can happen

20
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:38,490
and that's why I'm telling you; it may be not connected but that's why I'm telling that.

21
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,340
-Very interesting what you are saying.

22
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:50,810
Actually one of the subjects which I have programmed for talking is about the meaning

23
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:56,070
of the interview and the effect and the relationship and all that.

24
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:06,810
-Although I was a bit angry that I had shown such a character of myself here in this interview

25
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:16,540
that it felt very bad. On the other side I said it's lead to touch things in myself

26
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:27,980
that are not every day. Every day with people I'm very open and expressive and I don't have,

27
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,730
it's very rare. So it happened, it had a significance for me.

28
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:45,730
I brought it up here because it was just before my son went to the army.

29
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,730
I represented it as if I had a fear of him going to the army

30
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:55,230
but actually I didn't say the real reason.

31
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:02,730
Because I have 4 children and I'm not that worried person in the daily life,

32
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:10,450
I let them do things and I can sleep before they come back at night, I'm not that worried person

33
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:22,900
but something with my oldest son is very significant.

34
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,400
It is deep, deep fear that I have towards him is ever since

35
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:44,140
and it's maybe connected to my fear from maybe clairvoyance but it is something psychic

36
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:56,240
that I have, a tendency to these places. I couldn't even express here, I was so frightful.

37
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,400
You asked me the questions and I was so frightful even to express my fear for him.

38
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:09,320
I don't know if it's in a dream, in a vision that I saw blood around him.

39
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:23,220
-And since then you have this kind of anxiety, this kind of fear concerning specifically him.

40
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:45,220
-Yes. Whenever I was with him I had no comfortable feeling. I wasn't calm with him.

41
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,540
I have 3 sons and 1 daughter, my third son is so wild and he is doing unreasonable things

42
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,290
and I'm not worrying.

43
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:00,800
Just before I came to the seminar, he drove a bicycle without helmet at night

44
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:09,300
and he had an accident. I got a call that my son had an accident and my heart was beating

45
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,310
but they said he is OK and I knew somewhere inside that he is OK.

46
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:19,800
It was a very severe accident and he wasn't even scratched.

47
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:28,050
I'm not worried for him but for my oldest son I have something as if he is connected to my father.

48
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:39,890
It's not my delusion. He is very similar to him, in his internal appearance, he is very strong guy

49
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:55,130
and his inner will is strong and very radiating and I want to prevent this fear.

50
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:12,640
Because I feel that this fear can harm him, that it can hurt him I do a lot of meditations

51
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,240
and prayings but it is still there.

52
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,800
When I was a kid 5 years old, I told my teacher, my parents are dying.

53
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:37,310
It was quite strange but when it happened, they were quite young 50 years old, both of them,

54
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:45,470
I was in touch with this feeling that I had from my childhood, that they are going to die young.

55
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,570
It frightens me a lot.

56
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:59,500
-When you were 5 years old you told your teacher, my parents are dying?

57
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,330
-Both of them. Both died, very close to one another.

58
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:16,070
-And they died 3-5 years later?
-No, they died when I was older.

59
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:24,230
It didn't occur so quickly. I was a child and my father died when I was 20 years old

60
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:31,070
and my mother died 5 years later.

61
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:38,970
But I had this connection with these feelings which I had always before that.

62
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:50,970
It's not that I predict things to happen. It's a fear,

63
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,570
it's more fear than I think something really psychic.

64
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,970
Maybe I will tell my symptoms what happened after taking Phosphorus?

65
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,570
-Yes.

66
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:15,220
-I took it just on my way back home and my energy level went very high.

67
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,970
When I'm here I always need more sleep, it's tiring these seminars

68
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:31,310
but also at home I couldn't do mental exertion late in the evenings and now I can do very easily.

69
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:40,050
I go to sleep and I didn't need more than 6 hours sleep and during the day I could very alert,

70
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:45,710
working, wake at 7 o'clock in the morning and I come back,

71
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:51,800
through the day I'm very busy in work and I felt more energy.

72
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:56,590
-You have a busy practice already?
-Yes, very much indeed.

73
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,810
It's more than what I can do but I'm not working on my own.

74
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:06,980
I also work with another homeopath with whom I do what we call stage practice for him

75
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:14,810
and we do two days together, we want to do research and we work very intensively.

76
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:25,720
I'm very much into Homeopathy. I got my menses one week earlier and it was very astonishing

77
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,970
because I used to get it in a regular date and it came earlier.

78
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:41,970
Also I didn't feel well before. Two days before menses I felt really bad.

79
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:56,970
I feel more tired but nervous, I feel a bit ill. Last time I had a flu before, 24 hours before that.

80
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:03,300
I don't feel good before menses. I used to have it since my first delivery

81
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:13,630
but after I took Carcinosin, it stopped and I had very exact menses and no PMS.

82
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,380
Now it came back again.

83
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:26,730
My sexual desire increased a lot after taking Phosphorus and my husband was very happy,

84
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,460
I became more thirsty for cold drinks.

85
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:40,290
I didn't drink cold drinks before so much but I started to drink, not with ice

86
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,140
but I drink quite a lot.

87
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:55,650
The symptoms of the menses, when the flow starts, it feels much better.

88
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,060
You told me if the remedy would not work, I should take Pulsatilla

89
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:11,380
but right after taking the remedy I started eating butter and some other fats

90
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:19,220
and I don't like meat but I ate more butter and things like this.

91
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,970
I also started to perspire, which I used to have long ago in the past

92
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:33,220
and when I came back to Israel the weather was very hot.

93
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:42,480
Here I'm not perspiring like that but when it's hot I perspire here, in the lower abdomen,

94
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:52,470
in the pubic, I have to change my underwear and also very much in the inner thighs

95
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:58,810
and I used to have spots there and I got it again. Even I couldn't walk.

96
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,970
-When you used to have that?

97
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:10,810
-20 years ago, even more, in my high school time.

98
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,960
-How it went away, by itself or you put some cream there?

99
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:25,400
-I didn't put anything. I think with the remedies it changed.

100
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:41,380
I have leucorrhea a little bit but now after the menses and after taking Phosphorus,

101
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,750
it was little pieces of cream cheese coming out.

102
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:58,630
Also I had again what I used to have before I took Carcinosin,

103
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:05,640
I had the tendency for constipation, it came back very strong.

104
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,630
Not that I'm constipated many days.

105
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,120
If I take the right diet, it won't happen, it's not more than two days

106
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,470
but the tendency wasn't there and it came back.

107
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:32,970
I always feel very good after stool. My hair is extremely falling.

108
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:43,380
It was like that always in the recent years but not so extreme, like since the Phosphorus.

109
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,980
Also my nails became very soft.

110
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:56,310
-Softer and brittle or not breaking?
-They can break easily.

111
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:15,860
I had fibrocystic breast and I think it was much better after Carcinosin and I didn't check it

112
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:23,460
but I feel in the left side, it came back. I can feel the area.

113
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,450
-If you finished I have to ask you some questions.

114
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:04,940
-What also became very strong to me, I'm very sensitive. The weather in Israel is very hot.

115
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,940
We have also mild winter.

116
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:14,200
I'm very sensitive when there is any air condition and I get to the area with the air condition,

117
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:24,450
I can develop sour throat, even the teeth and all my body acts like I have flu.

118
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,770
It happened to me 3 times since I took the Phosphorus.

119
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:38,020
I don't like the winter in general, I don't like the summers, they are very extremes in Israel

120
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:48,320
but this weather here is just perfect, I'm not hot, I'm very easy and I like it like this.

121
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,040
I used to suffer as a child from tonsillitis.

122
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,420
-Your tonsils are out now?
-No.

123
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:05,260
But from last time I got fever from tonsillitis was when I was 20 years old.

124
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,510
I remember when I went first time to homeopath, it was 20 years ago

125
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,760
and I didn't know anything about Homeopathy.

126
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:22,610
I asked her to bring me back fever because I felt very good.

127
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,270
-After the fever, clean.

128
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:33,750
-Yes, also it was important to say that the times I got fevers during the recent years,

129
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:40,610
last one was in 1993 was after tremendous shock from the body.

130
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:48,330
Last time I got after 10 days after an operation. I didn't want to take antibiotics

131
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:56,000
after the operation and 10 days after I got very severe fever, I didn't take anything,

132
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:03,840
I felt very good during that fever.

133
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:11,090
Even though it was delirium, even illusinations I felt very good.

134
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:21,850
I can remember I had also after the third delivery high temperature.

135
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:29,600
When my body is after very severe emotional stress, it happened to me once in the army.

136
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,590
It was the last time I got tonsillitis, it was after a very severe emotional shock

137
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:39,020
that I developed that.

138
00:19:54,270 --> 00:20:05,510
As I said before, when I was a child I was born 5 years after my parents holocaust.

139
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:20,510
I thought a lot of this because I was a very sweet child and timid and withdrawn.

140
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:31,510
I had a real problem of speaking in the class. Something with teachers and big group

141
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:40,010
I had problems, I was very good always in one to one relationship.

142
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:51,770
I was never told that I was born after a death of my sister from polio.

143
00:20:52,270 --> 00:21:00,420
My parents came after a real drama and then in Israel in the beginning of the 50's

144
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:07,670
they had this polio epidemic and my sister that was before me, died.

145
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:17,670
My parents never said a word of anything concerning their past of this trauma they had

146
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:26,670
and they were very expressive people. The whole thing was kept.

147
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:39,670
But I know as a child I was very sensitive to all this kind of impressions

148
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:43,000
and I could feel them very strong.

149
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:54,630
When I was 6 years old I could know to myself that he is from their land.

150
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:08,780
I said that because I think my problem from speaking and trembling comes maybe

151
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:19,620
from over excitement and being excited and very easily impressed. This is how I see it.

152
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,120
Another thing that I wanted to talk is about my fears.

153
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:34,370
I mainly fear from cruelty, from violence. We never had television at home, in my house.

154
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:43,970
Part of this is cultural thing that we don't really like junk, not in food,

155
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:55,060
mainly not in spirit but also I'm very sensitive to see human cruelties.

156
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,650
Recently in Israel we were very involved with the earthquake in Turkey

157
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:08,700
and people were very afraid. I don't have any fear from natural, cosmic disasters.

158
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,220
I just don't fear it.

159
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:18,380
I don't have fear from thunderstorm and fears from cosmic catastrophies

160
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:31,380
but I can get very agitated and excited if something is happening by people.

161
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:46,360
I live in a very violent place. So it's maybe a reason for me to be there.

162
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,720
It's very difficult for me this thing.

163
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:59,600
-When you were in the army you had problems? Because army by its definition is cruel.

164
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,460
-I was professional in the army.

165
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:13,700
-What profession?
-I had a very rare job.

166
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:28,240
The education department unit in the army established something of researching nature

167
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:34,440
and archaeological and historical sites and teaching the soldiers about various places

168
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,460
in the land of Israel.

169
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:44,200
Then Israel was much larger because we (?) in the desert and I had to study a lot,

170
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:50,950
the whole thing was new and a lot of archaeology and nature and geology.

171
00:24:51,050 --> 00:25:03,940
I knew the army very well but the army itself...

172
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,200
-But you were outside of the fighting units.

173
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:13,950
I went into the army during a war that was very severe and I was more touched

174
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:21,210
with the casualties that I saw and the emotional shocks that people had during the war.

175
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:35,200
What I mean is more, a couple walks with the children in the forest and an (?) came

176
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:46,190
and murdered them in such a cruel way, out of the blue, this or vice versa, that can kill me,

177
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,630
that's very hard.

178
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:59,350
-The fact that you don't see television was decided by you or by your parents or your husband?

179
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:05,600
-My parents had television and my mother liked it very much to see these violent things.

180
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,270
-So it's your decision.

181
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:17,020
-Mainly it's my decision but my children went through this very harmoniously

182
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,770
and now that one of my sons wants himself, he bought, he lives in a little unit downstairs

183
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:30,950
and he has his own. I respect it, I don't want to have it in our place.

184
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,710
-When you finish you tell me because I have to ask you some questions.

185
00:26:47,220 --> 00:27:01,700
-My colleagues told me to tell you, it's very difficult for me to ask money from people.

186
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:12,950
-You have a timidity. Everybody who starts has difficulty.

187
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:21,940
Hahnemann himself suggested to his pupils, you have to take to show respect.

188
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:28,100
The others must respect your work and the respect is shown by just paying something

189
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,450
for what you are doing.

190
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:44,010
What I want to ask you is, I see here in the notes that the warm room

191
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:49,600
you said it was bothering you. Is it less bothering now?

192
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:01,610
-Not a warm room, the warm room will not bothered me, it is stuffed room.

193
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:20,820
-Then you did not mention anything about sweets last time. How much you like sweets?

194
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:28,190
Do you like sweets, you don't like sweets, is any change in that respect? Sweets and salt.

195
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:38,830
-I don't add any salt in my dishes. Sweets is a difficult question to me

196
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:47,990
because I'm very aware of nutrition and I don't know how much in my impulses

197
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:57,080
come from my understanding. I do like to have some cakes. I'm not a chocolate eater

198
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:08,570
but I used to love it when I was smaller but I'm not addicted to sweets, I can be without it.

199
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:16,260
I don't like ice-cream so much. I can eat but I'm not craving.

200
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:23,040
-Your feet in bed are normal temperature? More hot, more cold?

201
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:28,230
-They used to be very cold in the previous years, I suffered from cold feet

202
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:36,500
and perspiring feet but after taking the Carcinosin it changed and it's more normal

203
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:44,480
but in the winter I always go with shocks in bed, I can never unwear the shocks in the winter

204
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,340
but not in the summer.

205
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:03,840
-This feeling, what you said you feel much better after stool, you mean psychologically

206
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:12,170
or physically?
-Physically. I feel more light.

207
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:24,080
-Can you say you feel more happy?
-Sometimes definitely.

208
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,770
-And the tendency for constipation is back.

209
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:43,180
Have you checked lately how is your fear of high places?

210
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:55,250
-When we were checking some friends, they were talking about bangee jumping they were doing

211
00:30:55,350 --> 00:31:03,010
I could collapse there, in a place. I never, never had any desire to be in the air.

212
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:15,230
Even in the times that I was hiking a lot and I liked hiking and I love walking,

213
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:23,450
they were people who were so enlighted up there but I wasn't. But I'm not afraid,

214
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:29,430
I can hike to a high mountain, I'm not attracted by this.

215
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:35,080
And I told you last time, if I see my children there then I will sink down.

216
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:43,730
I can not see them in a high place. I have this unease, my husband has to hold me back

217
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:49,670
and let them go. I'm very much...

218
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:57,070
-Have you noticed if you perspire except from lower abdomen?

219
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:03,070
-I do perspire in other places but this I had it long ago and it came back

220
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,820
and the perspiration in the feet I had it more than I have it now.

221
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,040
I have a little bit but not as before.

222
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:15,570
-Perspiration in the head? Do your perspire in the sleep?

223
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:23,830
-I don't think so. I never felt it very directly here.

224
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:34,680
-What about the flow? You said once the flow is coming, then you feel good.

225
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:43,560
Is it a flow which is clean, red blood or sometimes it has some clots,

226
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:49,670
not so bright red more dark?

227
00:32:50,170 --> 00:33:00,050
-Usually it is bright and at the end I have some dark spots, specially since the Phos.

228
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:20,800
But my flow is not so strong. Maybe 2-3 days.

229
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:37,780
I also mentioned that after taking Phosphorus in 1993 I had some skin eruptions coming here.

230
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:49,210
Now it's all over the place.It's like skin fungus and a little wart came out but very little.

231
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,190
-Do you remember having warts on your fingers?
-I never had.

232
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:23,460
-You like fruits? All kinds of fruits or you like more ripe fruits or green or sour fruits?

233
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:39,900
-I don't like that much oranges, I like fruits, I eat them. I don't like meat very much.

234
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:50,870
I have aversion to meat and I don't like milk too, I do like yogurt and feta cheese

235
00:35:50,970 --> 00:36:11,310
but not milk. I can drink milk in a tea, it's not aversion to milk but I don't like it by itself.

236
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:41,460
Maybe I did not stress enough the point that I dwell a lot about my family history past

237
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:47,290
it's not so much grief although you see that I'm almost crying.

238
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:52,970
It's not grief but it's dwelling on the past.

239
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:02,620
After taking the Phosphorus something interesting happened. 20 years I wanted to go

240
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:12,130
and see my parents place, especially my father's place is in Hungary where he was born

241
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,620
and I did it very spontaneously, after taking the Phosphorus

242
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:24,400
and I wanted to do it for 20 years; it was very fascinating trip.

243
00:37:52,200 --> 00:38:00,950
Your thinking is between either waiting or this remedy. Correct?

244
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:16,200
This is your dilemma, shall we write waiting or shall we write this remedy?

245
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,530
It's not very big dilemma therefore.

246
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:45,890
Taking the cases and investigating really it is a adventure of discovery

247
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:57,720
and you will discover more and more, if you keep on taking the cases in this way.

248
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:05,360
Discover human nature, discover a lot of things which are happening

249
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:11,220
within the human soul and mind.

250
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:29,960
And maybe if we have time, in the subjects that I would like to discuss,

251
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,960
though they may seem to be a little bit theoretical,

252
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:41,290
it is the subject of what is the meaning of taking a case

253
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:51,040
what is the preparation of a homeopath to take a case, what kind of an attitude

254
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:58,370
and the psychological state he should have, are you interested in this matter?

255
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,300
-Yes.

256
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:18,390
-We'll see if we have some time we'll talk about that.

257
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,730
Who prescribed wait for her?

258
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:42,330
Who together with wait prescribed a new remedy appearing?

259
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:50,350
Who prescribed that the new remedy is Calcarea Carbonica?

260
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:58,810
The class is getting too good. Very soon you'll be better than me.

261
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:19,290
This is exactly the idea with this case. She is doing quite well

262
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:28,060
and the next remedy appears quite clearly. This is the beauty of Homeopathy.

263
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,800
This is real beauty.

264
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:38,880
This is what makes you really happy and I believe you also feel that

265
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:43,840
because you see it you discover it.

266
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:53,800
What are the symptoms which lead you to the Calcarea Carbonica? First the cruelties.

267
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:12,140
Then the perspiration, then the constipation, then the coldness of the legs, then?

268
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,070
Where is my notes for this case?

269
00:42:45,560 --> 00:43:02,540
Soft nails, brittle nails, vertigo high places.

270
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:08,290
You see the vertigo high places was there and remains.

271
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:29,900
Better after stool, happy after stool, show me this rubric.

272
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:44,310
This you should have noted immediately. That is a symptom of Calcarea Carbonica.

273
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:52,820
Calc. Carbonica, Nat. Sulphuricum is very strong, Nat. Carbonicum, Borax.

274
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:11,160
Cheerful after stool, that she said it very clearly.

275
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:17,060
The moment she said that, immediately your mind should go there and then she said

276
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:27,820
I can not see cruelties and the soft nails the case is going towards Calcarea Carbonica.

277
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:35,740
The problem is will you give it yes or no?

278
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:44,980
In this case because she is doing quite well, you can still wait until when?

279
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:50,660
What do you want more?
-Cold in the summer.

280
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,910
-Or perspiration around this area.

281
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:23,980
-I would like to know your opinion about Carcinosin. To my understanding she got before.

282
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:34,140
what that did to her because she said after Phosphorus this and this came back.

283
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:39,370
-Correct. This is the next subject that you have to discuss and make clear

284
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:42,380
what happened with the Carcinosin?

285
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,130
Because she took Carcinosin and several of the physical symptomatology

286
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:53,710
which has gone away with Carcinosin, has come back.

287
00:45:53,810 --> 00:45:57,960
We have to investigate that matter. In order to investigate that matter

288
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:06,640
and to really know the answer, we have to know ...

289
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:15,670
-Many major essential symptoms leading towards Calcarea Carbonica

290
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:20,500
but at the same time she has a main fear about her oldest son.

291
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,090
My impression was that this fear is torturing her a lot.

292
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,930
Why would it be a mistake to prescribe Calc. now at this moment?

293
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:50,170
-Not really. You are entitled to prescribe Calc. Carbonica at this stage

294
00:46:50,270 --> 00:47:02,080
but as the case is progressing, you can still wait to see how far Phosphorus

295
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:07,190
will take the case and where it will stop.

296
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,930
She will have to take Calcarea Carbonica definitely.

297
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,930
There are symptoms which indicate that she must take it; she can not avoid it.

298
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:28,840
Now you are entitled but even a better answer would be wait for a period of time

299
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:35,080
and then have in mind Calcarea Carbonica. This is quite a good answer.

300
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:42,350
She comes in the same group like the little angel.

301
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:50,000
Both Phosphorus changing into another remedy but we suspect the remedy,

302
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,500
we don't prescribe it.

303
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:57,520
We can still wait because we see they are doing quite well.

304
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:08,170
Now concerning her fear I perceive, she is a very sensitive individual as you understand

305
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:10,590
and very perceptive.

306
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:20,590
She, herself said what I perceive is not a fear, it is an intuition almost.

307
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:34,510
This intuition makes me uneasy, anything happens, oh what might happen to my son?

308
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:43,660
It's not exactly the fear you can control with homeopathic remedy

309
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:53,430
because she has a conviction that her perception is more or less correct.

310
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:01,660
She will stay with that conviction. It is difficult to take it away by the remedy.

311
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:08,930
I don't know maybe after Calcarea Carbonica she will have less of that.

312
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,160
-One more point for Calcarea Carbonica that I didn't mention.

313
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:19,660
When I put on shocks in the night, it's never in the morning.

314
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:28,240
I always take it away during the night, which I think it's also from Calcarea.

315
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:34,540
I told my friends that I felt Calcarea is coming but artificially I came to you this time

316
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:40,050
because the seminar is now. Normally if you would be my homeopath in my country

317
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:46,280
I wouldn't go now because I, myself still feel that the fear is better

318
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:52,280
and Phosphorus is still there and I don't want to lose the action of the remedy;

319
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,540
I wouldn't take now another remedy.

320
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:59,860
-Very good. This is a good confirmation, what she says.

321
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:06,370
I'm quite happy, I will not go to a homeopath yet, I will not bother so much

322
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:09,030
by something which is there.

323
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:21,030
Therefore wait. So our estimation is correct, to wait but what I want to stress is this.

324
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:26,790
In the past I went to different countries and I prescribed live cases.

325
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,880
I take the case and I prescribe.

326
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:44,700
80% of these cases were spoiled by my students who later on, 5 or 6 or 20 days later

327
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,530
because the patient complained of certain symptom, they give another remedy

328
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,110
and then another remedy and another remedy.

329
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:59,710
I go next year to see the case and of course the case is in a terrible state.

330
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:08,290
I had the opportunity to see that when I was prescribing myself.

331
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:12,610
But now you have the opportunity to see what happens when you wait,

332
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:19,120
when you can evaluate correctly you wait, then how the case develops.

333
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:30,870
This is the beauty of Classical Homeopathy. Don't be in a hurry to prescribe.

334
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:35,620
Her feeling is very correct when she says, I'm really feeling much better

335
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:40,620
and I don't want to lose this. It's the first time in my life that I feel so well,

336
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,450
don't give me another remedy.

337
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:49,110
She says, it is not that I don't want to take your remedy. If you insist,

338
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:57,620
I will take Thuja and I say no. Don't take Thuja yet, wait.

339
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,220
Because she is not anxious to take another remedy.

340
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:10,480
Like in the same way, Hava is not anxious to take another remedy.

341
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:14,460
But why do we give the Sulphur in the other case?

342
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,440
They are 3 cases which have reached the point

343
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:27,290
where the second remedy has become apparent and clear. 3 cases. Like the Sulphur case.

344
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,530
Why do we give the Sulphur case?

345
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:36,240
Because the Sulphur case has some symptoms which are bothering him.

346
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:42,200
The fact that he wakes up in the morning and then the picture also of Sulphur

347
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:50,550
is so clear, so typical that is going to benefit him absolutely.

348
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:56,220
It is a blessing really, I can tell you.

349
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:07,870
-We still wanted to discuss the question of Carcinosin please in this case.

350
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:13,220
-The Carcinosin question is like this.

351
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:24,110
If the patient tells you that I took Carcinosin and I'm better in my menses,

352
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:31,620
better in my breast, better in my headaches, better in this, better in that

353
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:42,970
but my anxiety was worse that was a suppression.

354
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:53,120
But if she tells you that I was better, better, better in everything and now is back,

355
00:53:53,220 --> 00:54:02,370
that means we are in a state in which ...

356
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:24,620
I have explained to you these remedies that go into a cycle. Sulphur-Calcarea Lycopodium.

357
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:34,640
Sometimes we see Ignatia. Ignatia many times is followed by Sulphur and then Calcarea carbonica.

358
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,530
That is another cycle.

359
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:47,620
In this case there might be a possibility, if there is a big stress in the organism

360
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:54,620
to start all over again Ignatia-Sulphur-Calc. carbonica

361
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:05,550
but the difference is that the cycle now is on a higher level.

362
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:20,200
You started with this unraveling, you reached there; now you have to make the same thing

363
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:25,550
but on a higher level. The same cycle but on a higher level.

364
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:47,290
I do not know and it has no meaning in finding out,

365
00:55:47,390 --> 00:55:53,120
because you are led by the present symptomatology.

366
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:58,120
So if she gives me symptoms of Calc. carbonica, I will give her Calc. carbonica.

367
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,950
If later on, she will give me symptoms of Carcinosin again,

368
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:07,210
then I will prescribe again Carcinosin. Or I will never prescribe Carcinosin again,

369
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:12,620
depending on her symptoms. Is she going to give me some symptoms, yes or no?

370
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,380
No symptoms, no remedy.

371
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,120
-Can I say something? I thought a lot about this issue of suppression by the remedies

372
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:25,200
because I was treated by Carcinosin ever since.

373
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:34,790
I started my treatment with Homeopathy in 1982 and I was prescribed by one of your students,

374
00:56:34,890 --> 00:56:36,790
I got Carcinosin.

375
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:43,460
They were impressed, it was after the death of my parents, they both died from cancer

376
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:49,540
and it was very in fashion to give Carcinosin. Then I got it 4 more times.

377
00:56:50,970 --> 00:57:00,530
I would say to this question that only last time, 2 years ago, I was benefited some things.

378
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:05,750
But I can say today it was suppressive remedy because simply what I studied here.

379
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:15,420
I never had symptoms going back. I never had any of (?) in my case.

380
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:23,350
I was so happy to get again perspiration, to get again sour throat, I never had it

381
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:28,590
after taking Carcinosin. So I thought it's not the right remedy, it was not correct.

382
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:40,360
It was the theme that I had. It wasn't prescribed on symptoms.

383
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:57,760
-I agree with what she says because there is one Greek who never studied with me.

384
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:02,010
He studied in Germany and he is practicing now.

385
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:13,360
He claims that 90% of his cases he gives Carcinosin and he claims that it has results.

386
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:18,670
I asked him to make a resume of what are these results,

387
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:23,180
can he give me some picture of Carcinosin?

388
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,420
What he did is, he copied whatever it was written for Carcinosin

389
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,920
and gave it to me without anything new.

390
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:35,850
If you give 90% of your cases Carcinosin,

391
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:41,670
you are definitely going to get some peculiar cases of Carcinosin that you have some effect

392
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:46,420
or some proving and therefore if you are careful you are going to collect a lot of information

393
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:48,670
concerning this remedy.

394
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:56,510
Therefore I believe that Carcinosin has been misused quite a lot in different countries

395
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,860
without real indications.

396
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:18,760
It's very interesting that the physical symptoms, almost all of them have come back

397
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:22,860
while the mental-emotional is clearing.

398
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:29,440
It's very impressive, it's very interesting, it's very instructive and we are very happy.

399
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:36,500
-I would agree that Carcinosin as a remedy is not understood well

400
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:40,590
and is prescribed too frequently for the wrong reasons.

401
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:47,340
As well as people who read the Organon decide to give Sulphur at the end of every case.

402
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,350
The understanding of Homeopathy is the thing that's lacking

403
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:55,100
and if there is a cancer in the family, immediately they give Carcinosin.

404
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:00,260
I find that there is a danger especially because it's a strong nosode that can do provings

405
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,030
and different complications.

406
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:22,680
-On Saturday we asked Frederick Schroyens why Carcinosin was coming so often in the VES?

407
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:31,430
He explained to us that if you repertorize and put a desire for food

408
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:37,510
and then aversions for food, you will get Carcinosin automatically.

409
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:44,270
-Because a lot of these symptoms have been recorded for Carcinosin.

410
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:48,920
The moment you record a lot of symptoms in desires and aversions,

411
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,530
of course always you will see Carcinosin.

412
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:57,000
This is another problem that we have to discuss.

413
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:02,420
Perhaps I've made some time to discuss a little bit more in detail

414
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,760
how to improve the Repertory.

415
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:14,180
In the way that our Repertories are done today, just damping anything

416
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:25,000
which appears this is a very dangerous practice.

417
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:30,600
It's going to make the Repertory finally a useless tool.

418
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:38,580
Can you imagine what is going to happen when all these rubrics are filled up

419
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,690
with 100,150,130 remedies?

420
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:48,920
And they are going to fill up because the way the information comes in,

421
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:55,940
a lot of information, all the rubrics will fill up with remedies.

422
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:07,520
You will lose the individuality and the specific personality of the remedy,

423
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:17,170
like some teachers who are teaching Materia Medica or if you read Materia Medica,

424
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:24,420
you read Medorrhinum and there is no difference from Sulphur, no difference from Aurum.

425
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:32,770
All they have depression, all they have fears... where is the individuality?

426
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:38,420
Here we're looking for the individuality.

427
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:45,110
What is the real quality of that particular case of that particular remedy?

428
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:56,920
-To clarify my mind that the symptoms now of the Phosphorus came back,

429
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:01,670
does it give me a hint that before were suppressed by the Carcinosin?

430
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:05,780
-Yes. It gives you a hint.
