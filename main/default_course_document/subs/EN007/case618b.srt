GERMAN LC681 FU1 06.06

2
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:30,782
I saw this child last September and the diagnosis was pubertas praecox

3
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:42,818
which means that the menstrual period had started already regularly at 2 years old

4
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:48,942
during which time she used to catch a cold with a sore throat and

5
00:00:49,462 --> 00:00:55,342
fever and she became very pale in her face during the menses

6
00:00:55,862 --> 00:01:02,782
she was very aggressive and violent temper fits with red face and perspiration

7
00:01:03,022 --> 00:01:08,418
in the face. She usually shouted stay away, leave me alone.

8
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:12,770
She usually hit her mother, didn’t want to be touched,

9
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:16,862
you could see strong anger in her eyes.

10
00:01:19,422 --> 00:01:25,822
The father says he felt he was helpless and could not deal with her energy.

11
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:35,298
At the age of 3 she grew very fast with breast and pubic hair started to grow.

12
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:45,022
She had received hormonal treatment and this was done by law.

13
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:52,942
Since that treatment no more temper tantrums, occasionally she hit herself.

14
00:01:53,982 --> 00:02:02,942
She has a cold now, she has a bronchitis.
 – Since about 2 weeks but not so acute.

15
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,142
In January I talked to the father and he reported her emotional state

16
00:02:33,662 --> 00:02:38,262
had greatly ameliorated but in the beginning it was really bad,

17
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:42,862
after taking the remedy. She had temper tantrums like before

18
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:45,942
she had started the hormonal therapy.

19
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,378
He was really upset what all came out after taking the remedy, she was so harsh…

20
00:02:53,622 --> 00:03:01,822
So intense. The same kind of intensity and anger and temper tantrums

21
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:09,742
as before the hormonal therapy. This phase lasted for 2-3 weeks and I was happy

22
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:13,582
as we homeopaths are when the emotions come back.

23
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:16,662
And I could calm him down when things settled also.

24
00:03:17,422 --> 00:03:22,050
Now in the long run she is more stable and pleasant with her like before.

25
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:27,662
What was surprising to the father is that in some situations she started behaving

26
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:31,262
more like a child again and for him this was a good sign and

27
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:36,622
the hormonal examinations showed a little bit more

28
00:03:36,898 --> 00:03:39,458
normalization compared to before.

29
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,578
The father also said she was more cheerful again and her laughing was coming

30
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:50,462
more from the heart. One time she had a cold for 2-3 weeks,

31
00:03:51,490 --> 00:04:00,182
the stool was rather hard, the sleep was good but nonetheless was tired

32
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:26,542
in the mornings. Every now and then she still speaks in her sleep.Talks in her sleep. She expresses and kind of emotion more clearly than before,more strongly.

33
00:04:27,582 --> 00:04:31,938
She can get very angry if things don’t work the way she wants them to.

34
00:04:33,462 --> 00:04:38,582
She has many ideas. A strong desire to cuddle.

35
00:04:40,622 --> 00:04:45,502
And in everything she does she needs a lot of time and hates being pressurized.

36
00:04:48,578 --> 00:04:55,222
The father says she is actually very sensible and has good ability to talk

37
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,302
and express herself, rhetorically she is strong.

38
00:04:59,062 --> 00:05:06,222
Wants to relate a lot, talk a lot and concerning foods it’s still the same,

39
00:05:06,742 --> 00:05:11,618
she eats everything especially meat, she likes a lot.

40
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,502
The only thing she does not like is whipped cream.

41
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:26,210
My general impression is that a lot have been taking place,

42
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:32,098
this is confirmed by the lab results but the father likes to talk about that himself.

43
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:36,702
Maybe we do that in the end, we brought some papers with him.

44
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:54,542
–Ok. Now what happened with growing hair in pubis continues or what?

45
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,382
– She does not have any pubic hair anymore since

46
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:06,338
they started the hormonal treatment, it all fell out again.
 – No menses?

47
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:16,302
– No, since the hormones. A couple of months later I also talked with the mother.

48
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:21,422
The mother related she actually could tell no change.

49
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:28,342
The mother felt that child very often was strenuous and very demanding.

50
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:35,502
The mother says if the child wants something, laments more than necessary…

51
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:42,422
She can be very intense or violent,
 impulsive and also beat the mother.

52
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:52,662
She also beats furniture but she did admit that this thrashing around has got less compared to before.

53
00:06:54,978 --> 00:07:01,378
Then she also confirmed that Nickola can be sensible and thinks a lot.

54
00:07:02,142 --> 00:07:06,498
The mother also reports that the child is very lazy and lets her mother

55
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:15,702
serve her a lot. And nothing may be abrupt, no sudden things,

56
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,810
because she cannot tolerate at all.

57
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:24,142
And I ask what happens if something abrupt happens and the mother says

58
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:28,502
she becomes irritable and screams no and starts to beat.

59
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:37,462
Mother’s nerves are really wrecked because the child always says

60
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:47,182
you are so mean to me. The child accuses the mother is being mean to her.

61
00:07:50,782 --> 00:08:00,258
– I want to ask the father a thing. There is a kind of controversy

62
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:10,742
between mother and sister.
– Which sister?

63
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:15,618
– I think it’s a controversy between mother and daughter taking place.

64
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:23,542
The mother is a rather nervous type who cannot tolerate stress.

65
00:08:27,138 --> 00:08:32,258
– There is no jealousy against the daughter because the father

66
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,890
pays to much attention to the daughter?
– That’s possible.

67
00:08:41,462 --> 00:08:44,290
The relationship between the parents is very tense

68
00:08:44,782 --> 00:08:46,850
as we related during the first interview.

69
00:08:48,622 --> 00:08:51,970
But the situation between the mother and me has got better,

70
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:54,262
it’s not like what it used to be.

71
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:04,502
– But the child is attached to her father rather than the mother?

72
00:09:05,782 --> 00:09:11,422
– That’s possible. When the child is together with both parents

73
00:09:12,182 --> 00:09:16,782
she becomes completely off-balance, that’s a very difficult time for the child.

74
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:30,862
– The child is jealous of her mother?
 – No, I don’t think so.

75
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:42,902
– She has no fever all this time?
– She never had fever.

76
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:48,022
She coughs since 2 weeks mostly in the mornings and in the evening.

77
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:55,182
– When lying in bed or before lying?
– Mostly already before and also

78
00:09:56,222 --> 00:09:58,018
when she lies down in bed, not during sleep.

79
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:09,022
– Have they noticed if the child cannot tolerate something around her neck?

80
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:25,142
– She doesn’t want that but I really didn’t pay attention up to now but she just said she doesn’t like to be buttoned up.

81
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:34,102
The mother says she is very sensitive to touch,

82
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:39,490
for example when the mother combs her hair and also very critical.

83
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:47,662
She tends to try and blackmail her mother and she is easily offended

84
00:10:48,702 --> 00:10:57,410
and she still has the temper tantrums but at night she cuddles so close to her mother

85
00:10:58,178 --> 00:11:00,738
and always touches the nevus of her mother

86
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:06,862
and concerning her general development her mother has the feeling that the child

87
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:12,770
sometimes talks like a child in puberty talking about those stupid boys

88
00:11:13,262 --> 00:11:17,102
and things like that.
 – Precocious.

89
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:26,062
– The mother just reports that she reacts like a child in puberty. Sleep is good.

90
00:11:26,338 --> 00:11:31,458
She sleeps in every position. No saliva. No perspiration.

91
00:11:34,262 --> 00:11:41,182
And she tired in the morning. She like to eat everything especially fried things.

92
00:11:43,222 --> 00:11:56,022
She also enjoys fish and juicy fruits, even lemons.
– Oysters? – She never tried.

93
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:04,738
But concerning food she is not complicated at all. She eats practically everything.

94
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:08,302
She is afraid of the thunderstorms.
 She is even afraid of rain.

95
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:17,022
– Is she afraid of the thunderstorms very much?
 – Yes.

96
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,610
– She will hide under the table?

97
00:12:21,622 --> 00:12:26,742
– She comes to me or to her mother and wants to be held and cuddled.

98
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:34,178
– Is it true that what it was written she is normally quiet

99
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,298
and confident only out of balance when parents are together.

100
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:51,582
This still is like this?
 – It’s true but it has got better. Finished.

101
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:09,502
They have said she was snoring in sleep, is that true?
 – That’s still the case.

102
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:24,862
– How much water she needs?  A lot, normal, cold water?

103
00:13:25,378 --> 00:13:29,730
– I think she takes normal amount of juice and water.

104
00:13:31,262 --> 00:13:36,382
– Asks for cold or normal?
– She drinks any kind of temperature.

105
00:13:36,898 --> 00:13:41,502
If something  has ice cubes in it she will take it just as she will drink warm,

106
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:54,050
no special affinities.
 – Do you see the growth of the hands? Do you check it?

107
00:13:55,822 --> 00:14:00,702
– This is a longer story. The growth of her hands is being checked once a year

108
00:14:00,942 --> 00:14:07,342
by Professor Waldhauser but when she was 4 years old the growth of her bones

109
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:15,022
represented a child of 8,5 years old. Last year at age 5 they checked it again,

110
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:21,422
the growth resembled to a hand of 10,5 years and this year in April

111
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:26,542
they checked it again and there it still resembled the age 10,5

112
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:29,102
meaning that the growth has stopped.

113
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:38,062
– Is she still continuing taking hormones?

114
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:41,410
– She gets an injection of hormones once in a month.

115
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:47,542
Legally I am obliged to do this, I am not permitted to stop.

116
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:51,382
– For how long?
 – According to the experience of Dr. Waldhauser

117
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:55,490
this will be continued till she is in the age of 10 year old.

118
00:14:58,302 --> 00:15:04,702
Up to age 10 and weight of around 50kg because then from all experience

119
00:15:05,462 --> 00:15:08,782
the injection with the hormones does not any effect anymore.

120
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:29,782
– What is her weight now?
 – About 27kg.

121
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:42,062
 – She shows any sign of masturbation?
– Well, she still does every now and then, sits on her knees and starts rubbing with

122
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,970
her feet, it has got a lot better, in former times this happened often and stronger,

123
00:15:48,738 --> 00:16:04,098
and she was smiling at me while she was doing it.
 – She flirts with grown-ups?

124
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:15,342
– Sometime but very rarely. If she finds a man sympathetic or

125
00:16:15,862 --> 00:16:25,090
she likes a man she tends to do it.
 – They say that she does not like to be touched.

126
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:33,538
Can you explain this?
 – That’s in combination with anger.

127
00:16:34,302 --> 00:16:37,102
If she is angry she says go away, don’t touch me.

128
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:45,302
– But somebody touches her otherwise she will accept?

129
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:53,250
– That’s no problem. My impression is that she is even seeking physical contact.

130
00:16:54,018 --> 00:17:03,490
When she sees me she comes and hugs me.
 – No constipation.

131
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:12,702
– Concerning the constipation now she has stools every day or every other day

132
00:17:13,218 --> 00:17:25,250
and very large amounts. Because I have to wipe her and that’s why I notice

133
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:33,942
it’s a large amount.
 – Her mother does not pay much attention to her.

134
00:17:35,742 --> 00:17:38,050
Who pays more attention the father or the mother?

135
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:44,702
– The mother has more time for her because she is only working 20 hours a week.

136
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,942
– Ask her who she loves more; the father or the mother?

137
00:17:56,738 --> 00:18:30,262
– Mom. – I think she loves both each in individual ways… 
- Is she going to school?

138
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:43,330
– She will start coming September.
 – Does she know how to read or…?

139
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:51,010
– She is better able to write already, reading only a  little

140
00:18:51,502 --> 00:19:02,262
but she also knows the numbers.
 – In general she is excitable,

141
00:19:04,062 --> 00:19:08,418
talking a lot or she is reserved and closed?

142
00:19:09,422 --> 00:19:14,542
– If she knows somebody well or she is together with her girlfriends she talks a lot…

143
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,862
- Ok!

144
00:19:33,742 --> 00:19:38,370
With the Medorrhinum it increases normally, with hormones is this way…

145
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:54,498
- She takes hormones since when?
 – 3,5 I think.

146
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,742
– So this time it was almost continuous to there…

147
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:16,770
- This was hormonal therapy and Medorrhinum…

148
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:22,658
- Impressive but you cannot really see it.

149
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:46,702
We will speak about the child. To my understanding this is a quite deep

150
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:56,182
hormonal disturbance and most probably will need a series of remedies

151
00:20:56,942 --> 00:21:01,822
before we can bring about the best possible effect.

152
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:11,810
At this moment the Medorrhinum seemed it had done some work

153
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:20,258
especially because we had an initial aggravation and then it was an amelioration.

154
00:21:21,262 --> 00:21:28,702
Therefore we know it was the first correct remedy and now the problem

155
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:39,182
is how to continue. And what information we have concerning the child.

156
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:55,822
We don’t have much information. At this moment it seems to me to be a good sign

157
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:08,898
that there is a sub-acute inflammation of the lungs which is going on and

158
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,702
this is one thing we have to take care of,

159
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:24,770
the other thing is to be guided by the psychological state of the child because

160
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:28,862
we don’t have much on the physical level.

161
00:22:31,662 --> 00:22:41,902
What would you think as guiding symptoms at this moment?

162
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:51,138
Can anybody give me what do you think as a guiding symptoms about this case?

163
00:22:55,742 --> 00:23:18,018
Nobody talks… - The very strong fear of thunderstorms.
 – That is correct. One…

164
00:23:25,422 --> 00:23:35,938
- She is beating her mother and she is angry.
 – What that means...

165
00:23:46,942 --> 00:24:13,302
We are impressed of course by the fact that at this age there is a kind of tension?

166
00:24:15,102 --> 00:24:22,782
Jealousy. It comes from jealousy but it’s a kind of controversy… not controversy…

167
00:24:25,582 --> 00:24:31,222
competition! Woman competition.

168
00:24:32,258 --> 00:24:38,902
It’s like two women competing for the man.

169
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:58,370
Actually for me it is very strong the jealousy of the child towards the mother

170
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:03,982
but also the jealousy of the mother towards the child.

171
00:25:05,022 --> 00:25:17,302
So it is from both sides but that child really has a kind of a competition

172
00:25:18,062 --> 00:25:20,382
and jealousy towards the mother.

173
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:34,210
So this was there before and continues to be after Medorrhinum.

174
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:44,942
Maybe a little bit less but it is because the aggression of the child has been reduced.

175
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:51,862
Therefore the expression of the jealousy of the child is less prominent.

176
00:25:53,410 --> 00:26:02,370
The child still has a competing feeling with the mother and definitely she is jealous.

177
00:26:02,862 --> 00:26:07,982
But now you will ask, when I ask her in front of the father,

178
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:14,142
who do you love more the child says my mother.

179
00:26:19,502 --> 00:26:25,410
This is the cunning thinking of a woman.

180
00:26:40,258 --> 00:26:46,142
You have to go into the psychology of the child, the father is there,

181
00:26:47,662 --> 00:26:58,690
the question is direct and what she does, she thinks first before answering,

182
00:27:01,742 --> 00:27:03,810
very quickly she comes to a decision,

183
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:14,050
I’ll tell my mother but she turns around to her father and she says ok we manage.

184
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:30,942
Her whole behavior towards the mother points very clearly

185
00:27:31,702 --> 00:27:49,378
that there is a woman who challenges the mother and she says he loves me more.

186
00:27:51,662 --> 00:27:59,862
My father loves me more than you and if he loves more you then I will hit you.

187
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:12,418
The element of competition and jealousy is very strong and it is there.

188
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:22,142
Therefore our mind should go to Lachesis. You remember I asked,

189
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:29,822
thinking of Lachesis, if she can tolerate tight clothes, she said no,

190
00:28:31,102 --> 00:28:39,298
I cannot but maybe the child did not know the importance of this question and

191
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:43,650
she answered not thinking very much.

192
00:28:44,142 --> 00:28:52,342
Do we have other points for Lachesis to support?

193
00:29:07,182 --> 00:29:09,502
– She is tired in the morning on waking.

194
00:29:13,342 --> 00:29:18,462
– Also coughing on waking in the morning and coughing in the evening before

195
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:27,662
and after sleep. That’s one. Another one do you know what it is? She says…

196
00:29:30,222 --> 00:29:38,422
- The father told us that she is talking a lot with her friends and to other people…

197
00:29:39,182 --> 00:29:46,622
- She is very talkative when she is at ease.
– Also she has a lot of ideas,

198
00:29:47,138 --> 00:29:52,770
fantasies this is also a sign…
- A lot of activity in the mind.

199
00:29:54,542 --> 00:30:06,850
There is one more point which is clear. You know that Lachesis when she has a pain

200
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:22,978
does not want to be touched. And when she has a psychological pain she says

201
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:28,610
don’t touch me, again one more point for Lachesis.

202
00:30:29,622 --> 00:30:35,778
She says does not want to be touched when she is in bad mood.

203
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:43,458
Therefore we have several points to support the idea of Lachesis.

204
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:56,258
The idea of Lachesis and the precocity of the child… Show me precocity of children.

205
00:30:58,302 --> 00:31:01,890
Medorrhinum, Lachesis, Veratrum album are main remedies.

206
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:13,410
So this is a precocious child. I believe it’s a child that will be flirting almost

207
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:28,502
in a sexual connotation with men and she will behave much older than her age.

208
00:31:29,782 --> 00:31:49,250
This is precocious.
 – The tendency to masturbation to children you find Lachesis

209
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:55,902
in the third degree too. Considering her moment state can you really take this

210
00:31:56,142 --> 00:32:02,302
as a symptom?
 – Yes, you can take it as a symptom.

211
00:32:02,542 --> 00:32:08,450
In children who have a tendency to masturbation you can take it as a symptom.

212
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:14,742
It only means that the hormonal system is not balanced.

213
00:32:15,255 --> 00:32:21,902
Therefore the expression if this imbalance is through masturbation.

214
00:32:22,662 --> 00:32:30,862
A child of 6 years who masturbated that means is a child whose hormonal balance

215
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:44,182
is not correct. Actually when the sexual activity should start together with puberty,

216
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:57,986
this idea, is ok. Many women even delay feeling having sexual symptom and

217
00:32:58,502 --> 00:33:07,222
they develop sexuality when the find a partner later 20, 25.

218
00:33:13,102 --> 00:33:20,535
So at this moment we want to push forward the organism and

219
00:33:21,026 --> 00:33:32,302
help her with the bronchitis which is when she wakes up and before going to bed

220
00:33:34,102 --> 00:33:41,262
this is the time Lachesis has aggravations. Therefore Lachesis 200C and 1M,

221
00:33:41,782 --> 00:33:45,862
first day and second day will push forward.

222
00:33:48,182 --> 00:33:55,342
The problem in such cases is that the organism will not develop

223
00:33:55,862 --> 00:34:01,222
because they give a hormone that stops the development, actually the general

224
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:09,942
development of the organism. The conventional medicine knows that the child will

225
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:19,415
remain in this height. We will go against these hormones because it is by law,

226
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:27,095
as she said, we cannot stop the hormones. I don’t know why this law is there,

227
00:34:29,142 --> 00:34:40,142
first time I hear there is a law… We don’t want to go against,

228
00:34:41,942 --> 00:34:58,582
we are not a revolutionary group. Lachesis 200C and 1M

229
00:34:58,822 --> 00:35:12,902
and we’ll see the child next year. Ask the father how is her height

230
00:35:13,422 --> 00:35:22,135
since last September. Did you check her height?

231
00:35:24,942 --> 00:35:37,222
– Since last September she grew 2.5 cm, Every month she grows about 0.5 cm,

232
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:54,626
sometimes 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, it depends. Where the normal is… who knows?

233
00:36:07,182 --> 00:36:12,302
– The professor in Vienna says that a child of this age normally grows up about 4cm

234
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:36,866
every year on average. We will see. We have an acute case. One question.

235
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:46,102
– In the paper I see that the Medorrhinum has been given once a month,

236
00:36:46,862 --> 00:36:50,182
I suppose this was due to the hormonal suppressive therapy during this time,

237
00:36:50,702 --> 00:36:58,902
would you give the Lachesis once a month also?
 – No I would like to give it only once,

238
00:37:00,182 --> 00:37:14,775
see if there is an effect and then I will decide.
 - Why this difference?

239
00:37:17,582 --> 00:37:30,382
– This level where she is now, with mostly the jealousy and the bronchitis,

240
00:37:31,662 --> 00:37:37,542
I consider it as an intermediate level. I believe that later on

241
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:55,735
we will have to give remedies maybe like pituitary gland, Baryta carbonica, I will see.

242
00:37:55,982 --> 00:38:01,346
But at this moment I want to see the effect on mostly emotional level and

243
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:06,742
see how kind of boost can be given.
