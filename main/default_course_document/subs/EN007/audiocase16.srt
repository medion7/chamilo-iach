1
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:28,500
-...codependency and sex addiction. I was born into an alcoholic family system

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:34,760
and had an alcoholic father. I stopped smoking 10 years ago.

3
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,000
I have done my types of drugs ranging from LSD to marihuana.

4
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:45,490
I have been drug and alcohol free for 10 years. I have been sugar, flour

5
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,990
and wheat free for 5 years.

6
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:56,100
The last 2 years I seemed to get the flu easily and having a hard time getting rid of it.

7
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,370
My immune system does not seem to function as it used to.

8
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:12,110
My allergies seem to be worse than ever. I ache all the time around my joints.

9
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,620
If I sit for a while, I have a hard time getting up.

10
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,370
I don't want to go to bed at night and I don't want to get out of bed in the morning.

11
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,370
Why you don't want to go to bed at night? Because of over excitement?

12
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,200
-I just don't seem to go to sleep until I'm totally exhausted.

13
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,950
-I play my computer games for hours, I generally sleep about 8 hours at night.

14
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:51,890
I'm very sensitive to the chemicals, restaurants put on beef.

15
00:01:52,890 --> 00:02:01,580
I think it is MSG and it gives me a case of running stool.

16
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,440
-What is this?
-Monosodium glutamate.

17
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:15,740
-I eat very little beef as it causes my anus to burn after I have a bow movement.

18
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,580
I have little interest in sex, isolate myself from others,

19
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,440
I'm usually in a hurry feel overwhelmed by life and depressed most of the time.

20
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:46,590
You have to have a really strong organism to survive all these kind of medicine

21
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,930
that he was given. I don't know.

22
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,090
The fact that he is in that condition, as we see him,

23
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:06,680
he looks in quite good condition is a miracle after all this.

24
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:17,580
That means he has put a lot of effort, a lot of will power this man to come to that condition

25
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,440
in which we see him today.

26
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:29,840
-After seeing the case yesterday I have a real fear that if I let go, I would be paralyzed

27
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,830
and cripple in a wheel chair, if I ever let go.

28
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,820
-You see what he says is very interesting "if I ever let go".

29
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:50,180
That means he goes on by sheer will power, he says another day, another day.

30
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,920
There is no enjoyment inside.

31
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:05,180
He will be very justified to take all kinds of drugs.

32
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:16,910
Because you find a drug, what is called "the trip" and he takes.

33
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,660
This life I can't live this kind of life.

34
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:33,010
Can you imagine inside him how he feels and what will power he needs to control all that?

35
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:48,520
And how the disturbance has progressed deeper and deeper.

36
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,670
He says the last 5 years he is constantly depressed. It's not his marriage.

37
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:03,410
What it has to do with his marriage? They destroyed his immune system and after that

38
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,350
he will feel all this kind of things.

39
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:26,090
In a case like that we have a very difficult case at hand.

40
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:46,490
There are two reasons. The one is that he does not give symptoms

41
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,100
on which we can base a prescription.

42
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,750
We do not have a clear case, as I said yesterday for the other case.

43
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,510
Here we do not have a clear case unfortunately.

44
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:18,350
Most probably it will be that we have to do a lot of work with him, very careful work.

45
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:27,000
He needs, in order to bring him around to health, he needs a lot of time and a lot of knowledge

46
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:35,080
from the homeopath to start with the right remedy and then continue in the right way

47
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,510
because one remedy will not do the trick.

48
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,170
We are going to have a series of remedies but the series of remedies

49
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,670
are going to be the first that is needed, the second that is needed

50
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,010
and then the third that is needed.

51
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:07,680
Of course with his history Medorrhinum was given and that was not a bad prescription.

52
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,930
From the first remedy that you were given, did you have any reaction you remember?

53
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:30,220
-The only reaction I remember from many remedies was one that I was given from my nose

54
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,730
to help the membranes inside my nose and if I would start with the allergies

55
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,310
and would start sneezing, if I would take this remedy, it would help stop sneezing.

56
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,570
-What was the remedy? Allium cepa?

57
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:53,820
-I think so yes. The rest I don't have any recollection. It's like...

58
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,180
-Having any effect.
-That's right.

59
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:59,540
-Scrotum and penis very sensitive almost hurts to touch. There is a pain or just sensitivity?

60
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:06,790
-My left testicle from the withered from the mumps it got big and then it shrunk.

61
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,500
-Now it is very sensitive?
-Yes.

62
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,050
-That means painful?
-Yes, sensitive and painful.

63
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,040
-But you have no problems, you have children.

64
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:24,530
-Yes, I have one testicle that works fine. I barely only need one.

65
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:31,700
-What I want to understand is you had excessive desire for sex and you lost that?

66
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:39,120
-Yes, it was actually compulsive. It was like an addiction but it's gone away.

67
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,610
Everything has gone away. It's really started going away with the drugs and the alcohol,

68
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,580
it was really the part of that.

69
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,360
-The drugs and the alcohol took it away?
-Right.

70
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:01,950
It was like having in an empty hall in the middle of your belly and the drugs and the alcohol

71
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,710
and sex and everything else was like filling up that hall but it only lasted

72
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,720
for a short period of time. Then you needed more.

73
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,370
I was really out of control with drugs and alcohol.

74
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:21,220
I was an alcoholic and drug addict and sex addict, all at the same time.

75
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:28,620
-As I say I wouldn't call it a miracle, I would call it a tremendous will power.

76
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,470
-I have a strong will.

77
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,940
All Canadians have.

78
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,210
-All Canadians have strong will?
-Yes.

79
00:10:51,970 --> 00:11:01,220
-That's why you have a good country, organized, too organized I would say.

80
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:33,280
Your sleep is straight? That means you go to bed but you go late and then you sleep

81
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,860
until the morning or you wake up in between?

82
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,360
-Most of the time I wake up in between briefly.

83
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,210
Sometimes I have to go to the bathroom, I wake up.

84
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,530
-How many times you will wake up during the night?

85
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,050
-Two or three times.

86
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:03,970
I wake up when my body hurts. Like last night it was like a circle around my body

87
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,880
and the bottom of my rib cage woke me up because it hurt.

88
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:25,720
-Do you cover your feet or you like your feet out of the covers?

89
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,300
-Out of the covers most of the time.

90
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:36,460
-Because of that burning of the soles or because they are warm in general

91
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,970
or you do not know why?

92
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,060
-I just like to have at least one foot out. One foot in, one foot out.

93
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:52,790
-After he took the Medorrhinum, the incidence of herpes outbreak tremendously.

94
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,540
Before he took the Medorrhinum, he had it occasionally

95
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,790
and then after the Medorrhinum it happens more and more often and then after the Clematis,

96
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:09,220
the sensitivity in his penis and scrotum increased.

97
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,220
-OK thank you.

98
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:25,390
-Did you ever have any warts?
-No, I have some small little warts on my hand.

99
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:34,290
-Very flat. No, it's not there.
-How about skin tags?

100
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,560
-I have some skin tags under my arm.

101
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:46,700
-What I want to ask you is whether you cry easily?

102
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,930
-No. I cry much easier now than I used to but...

103
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,030
-But still not easy.
-I still control it.

104
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:06,200
-In your house, in your things are you organized? You put everything in order?

105
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:13,930
-I think I'm organized but I'm messy. I know where everything is if nobody touches it

106
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,600
but it's not neat.

107
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,440
-It's not neat.
-No.

108
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,200
My wife on the other hand is very neat.

109
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:27,810
-So there is complementary.

110
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,130
-I have a room where I can be messy and she has the rest of the house to be neat.

111
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,230
-That's better. It's good arrangement.

112
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:03,890
You see the palms are burning. Is it heat or is it burning pain?

113
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:10,490
-Like burning pain and it's worse if I have herpes outbreak.

114
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:21,890
My hands also feel swollen, especially if I use my hands like if I dig a hole,

115
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,060
just the least minor work. I used to work with tools but not anymore.

116
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:38,380
-Did you ever have any laboratory tests made? Blood test?

117
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,720
-Not recently. They always show normal. Everything shows normal.

118
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:57,620
-Liver test you have done?
-I think I had some.

119
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,860
I don't remember why, with the blood test a few years ago but I think everything showed normal,

120
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,220
cholesterol. They found it was an oriental...

121
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,710
-You like to put some questions?

122
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:44,370
-What is your response to temperature, hot or cold? I understand that you live in Canada?

123
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:52,620
-No in Florida now. I don't like the heat so much, I don't like the humidity

124
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:59,780
because I've been in Florida, I can feel the cold up here but I don't really mind the cold,

125
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,390
I enjoy it.

126
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,640
I really don't like humidity.

127
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:17,400
-Could you tell me your reactions to be indoors and outdoors to air in general?

128
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:25,290
How do you feel for example when you are indoors or you are in a room

129
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:34,090
and the windows are not open?
-I don't feel restricted. It feels fine.

130
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,470
-And if you go outdoors in the open air, how does that affect you?

131
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,960
-I like it as long as it is not humid. I like it being outside.

132
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:53,720
-Looking for aggravations, for low energy, sleepiness or hunger during the day?

133
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:08,880
-That's been changeable. Lately I seem to have fairly consistent low energy all the time.

134
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:16,110
I used to have spikes and then valleys but lately it just seems to be

135
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:25,860
just a general level of enough energy to do what I have to do.

136
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:36,960
-Do you have any hard time to stand up for a long time?

137
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,410
-Yes.

138
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,860
-In which sense? What is wrong if you stand up?

139
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,550
-My knees hurt, my feet hurt, my back starts to hurt, I have to move around.

140
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,650
I just can't stand on one spot and I can't sit on one spot either.

141
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:58,210
-How is the time passing for you? Do you think the time is passing fast or slow?

142
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,820
-Fast, very fast.

143
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:07,170
-Any problem with trembling?
-No.

144
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,990
-Does the humidity affect your joints as well?

145
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:20,830
-I don't know if the humidity affects my joints but it affects my lungs.

146
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,730
My joints hurt all the time and I don't have any... Of course is humid all the time in Florida also.

147
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:37,080
-You said that you wake up in the evening. Is there any particular time that you wake up?

148
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:43,830
-I don't really look at the clock, I don't know if there is a particular time.

149
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,480
-I'd like to ask two questions. One about the bump on you head and the other one is regarding,

150
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:54,080
you said you are affected by damp can you tell me if it's warm damp or cold damp?

151
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:02,080
-There is no cold damp in Florida. So it would have warm damp.

152
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,560
-The bump?

153
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,580
-The bump on my head I don't know what it is.

154
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,320
I had acupuncture treatments for a long time to make it go away. When I was 4 years old,

155
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:22,050
I got hit with the baseball and it sort like dazed me and I went home, crawled home, whatever...

156
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:26,980
I think the bump is ever since. It's a funny bump, it's like an egg.

157
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,320
-Is it painful?
-No, it's not painful.

158
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:37,730
-You have a growth on your right face like a mob, did you always have that?

159
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:44,580
-Yes, I have another one at my leg just like that.

160
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:57,370
-Could you tell us how do you feel to the suffering of other people?

161
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:00,360
-I have a great deal of empathy to the people who are suffering.

162
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,940
-What do you do? Do you do help if you see somebody...?

163
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,940
-Yes, as a matter of fact I'm in graduate school,

164
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,780
I'm working on a Master's Degree of social work.

165
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:22,180
-Could you tell me about the nature of your discharges? What color are they, thickness?

166
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,100
-I don't have any discharges now but when I had,

167
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:33,450
the time when I had gonorrhea... are you talking about... from the nasal...?

168
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:43,140
It depends if I'm having a flu is very clear or sometimes my nose just runs like clear water

169
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:51,890
and then if it gets thicker, then it gets like milky white

170
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,500
and then if I'm really sick it gets yellow.

171
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,730
So it varies.

172
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,990
-Are your hands dry or just normal?

173
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,230
-I'm a salesman for a living and one of the things I've learned to do is to control my hands,

174
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,990
whether I'm nervous or not, they are usually dry.

175
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,640
-Are too dry sometimes like really rough?

176
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:26,490
-No I wouldn't say that. They are little moist right now.

177
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:36,730
-I have two questions. How is your thirst?
-I'm not very thirsty.

178
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,370
-When you do drink, what temperature drinks do you prefer?

179
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,070
-Cold.

180
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,680
-Can you tell us about what fears do you have?

181
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,980
-You name it and I'm afraid of it.

182
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:01,470
-Could you be a little more specific? Give us some example?

183
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:12,800
-I have a fear of success and a fear of failure at the same time, I have fear of abandonment,

184
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,050
I have some fear of people...

185
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:29,060
I began not to trust people in the last few years, especially in business,

186
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:40,050
I have fear that I will not get well, I have a fear that I'm just going to wither away.

187
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,960
Sometimes I feel like, I don't know if you read Gulliver's travels

188
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:51,290
but when the little [?] going to the ground with the needles and threads, I feel like that,

189
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:58,140
that I'm stuck, that I'm not going to get out, that I'm not going to break out of this.

190
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:16,040
-Your food likes and dislikes?
-I don't likes vegetables very much, I like starch,

191
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:24,290
I don't particularly care for starchy vegetables, I do like potatoes but not some of the other ones.

192
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:28,560
-Is there anything that you hated before but you like it now?

193
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:43,280
-I hated salad before but I can tolerate it now. I eat a lot salad out of the knowledge

194
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,540
that I need to put vegetables in my system, not because I like the taste.

195
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:58,140
-Did you like something before but you hated now?
-Not that I can think of.

196
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:07,630
-How do you feel if someone shows you sympathy?

197
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:15,530
-It can bring tears to my eyes if someone shows me sympathy or shows someone else sympathy,

198
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,880
when I'm around. It's an emotional experience for me.

199
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,890
-Do you tend to be philosophical?
-Yes.

200
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,630
-Could you tell me a bit more about that?

201
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:38,120
-One of the things I have done is intellectualize my entire life, I supposed to emotionalize it,

202
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,120
it's just been the last two years that I began to even feel feelings.

203
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:50,370
Prior to being in therapy I only thought feelings, I would come to intellectual understanding

204
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,370
of appropriate emotional response and then model it.

205
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,050
I supposed to actually generating a feeling from within myself.

206
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,890
I do now have feelings. I feel like human being.

207
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,570
-Are your eyes bothered by light?

208
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:16,550
-I wear sun glasses all the time, there is a lot of sun in Florida. I don't like bright light.

209
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,480
I'm also going blind in the dark.

210
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:32,890
-Can you imagine an area in sciatica where herpes outbreaks?

211
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:39,390
-Yes sciatica generally precedes herpes....

212
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,470
-Where is the sciatica?

213
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:51,460
-Down on the right side, in the back from my hip because down my foot...

214
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,970
-Numbness, tinglings are the sensation?
-Just burning.

215
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:04,120
-When you were talking about your fears, how do you feel about heights?

216
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:10,520
-I'm afraid of heights but the reason I'm afraid of heights is because of my job sometimes

217
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,610
I have to go up in the air, in a tall building. And if I'm out in the balcony,

218
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,050
I have a tendency to jump.

219
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:28,460
-Are you afraid of spiders?
-Probably I'll kill them if I see them.

220
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:51,800
-Do you have any crack skin in your body and do you have any problem with your finger joints?

221
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:58,200
-Yes, my thumb joint hurts, my little finger on my right hand joint hurts.

222
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:08,130
The rest of the joints are OK. A cracking skin, I don't have any cracking skin.

223
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:19,050
-Have you been successful in your business?
-Failure.

224
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:27,860
-The history in your family, your parents were sick, well, they are living,

225
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,130
what disease did they have?

226
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:36,170
-My paternal grand mother died from heart attack at age 55,

227
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:41,930
my paternal grand father lived to be 90, my maternal grand mother and grand father

228
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,780
both lived to be 90.

229
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:53,160
My maternal grand father was gassed in the world war one and survived it,

230
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,020
he also was a Canadian veteran.

231
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:08,900
My maternal grand father was unhealthy but he lived through everything.

232
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:16,500
My grand mother never really got sick, she just put up with it.

233
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:26,490
My father died at age 55 with a heart attack, my mother is still alive and in her 70's

234
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:33,340
she had urinary cancer, total hysterectomy and had her one breast removed.

235
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:59,430
I think when my paternal grand father was about 89, he developed diabetes before he died

236
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,620
and it was just part of being old.

237
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,680
-How does water affects you? Itching your skin?

238
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,120
-It cools it off but it doesn't take the itching away.

239
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:24,360
-I will ask one more question and then we stop.

240
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:31,180
Such cases have a lot of symptomatology, tremendous lot of symptomatology

241
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:38,940
because the whole system is suffering, so whatever system is suffering, the eyes, the nose,

242
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:47,430
the mouth, the body, the extremities, the whole system is suffering so it presents symptoms

243
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,270
from all systems.

244
00:30:51,780 --> 00:31:01,590
The idea with this case is to find where is the focus, homeopathically wise.

245
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:07,340
Not the focus in his pathology because there is no actually focus in his pathology.

246
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:16,090
You can not say the focus is the eyes or the nose or the stomach or the sciatica

247
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:18,530
or the depression.

248
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:33,540
So you ask all these questions, so you are now satisfied, you have all the information.

249
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,880
Now process it.

250
00:31:52,880 --> 00:32:01,880
In this case, what is your process assess?

251
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:24,380
I will ask one more question. What is the question I'm going to ask?

252
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,790
Somebody is maybe clairvoyant from the audience.

253
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:46,620
I ask whether he is critical towards others? Are you a critical person?

254
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,480
-Yes, I'm very judgmental.

255
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,930
-Thank you.

256
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:30,260
Here we have, as I said, we have a lot of symptoms, it is a confused case,

257
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,510
not only because of several homeopathic remedies that he had

258
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:45,010
but also because systems like that, systems that are deteriorated in their immune system,

259
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:54,120
his immune system has suffered a lot, usually they do not give clear cut pictures.

260
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:06,900
Where shall we start? Yet there is one remedy that will give the optimum result,

261
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,990
not will cure, it will give the optimum result.

262
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:17,650
And we are trying, this is our objective now, to find the remedy

263
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:22,640
that will give optimum result for him. What is optimum results?

264
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:30,910
Optimum results will be a remedy that will set his organism in better condition

265
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:36,740
so that the next symptomatology that will bring about, will more clear.

266
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:41,830
This is my objective with this case.

267
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:57,170
When he started can you give me the symptoms, as he related them?

268
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:13,480
Heat of hands and foot, twitching on the inguinal region and loathing of life.

269
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:22,350
These were 4 symptoms, the first 4 symptoms that he related.

270
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:34,580
And then he related some more symptoms, give me the second step.

271
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:48,820
Already with this information, my mind was settled. This is the remedy,

272
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,950
not because of the 4 symptoms alone but for some other reasons that I will explain to you.

273
00:35:55,050 --> 00:36:01,950
He said food and drinks, sugar aggravates, farinaceous food aggravate,

274
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:07,300
after vaccination symptoms and suppressed gonorrhea.

275
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:21,470
Then he related some more symptoms, just to remind us.

276
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:48,870
Genitalia sensitiveness, heat in the foot, uncovers them, burning in the palms,

277
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:54,720
standing aggravates and time passes too quickly.

278
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:03,970
These are some of the symptoms.

279
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,710
Give some more.

280
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:27,200
Suicidal disposition, ability for philosophy, loss of vision and censorious.

281
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,770
What's the remedy?

282
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:42,110
-Thuja.
-Carcinosin.

283
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:50,780
-Agaricus.
-Nux vomica.

284
00:37:51,780 --> 00:38:02,860
-Nat. Sulphuricum.
-Pulsatilla.

285
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:21,430
-I only vacillated one time and the only remedy which I considered except from the one

286
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:26,280
that I will tell you is Natrum Sulphuricum.

287
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:39,180
The reason for that is his depression and also the injury to the head from the ball,

288
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:45,260
though there is no connection between depression and the injury to the head

289
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:51,610
because the injury was done when he was very young.

290
00:38:54,610 --> 00:39:02,520
Also the aggravation from farinaceous food which is strong with the Nat. Sulphuricum.

291
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:10,280
The Natrums are aggravated by farinaceous and the Pulsatilla

292
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:21,350
also is aggravated very much by farinaceous food, flour.

293
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,520
Vacillated but only for a second and then I said, no.

294
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:47,770
The reason is that we have a better choice. What is the better choice? Show me.

295
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:08,430
Sulphur is the better choice for many reasons that we will see.

296
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:13,020
Can you show me Sulphur how much of his symptomatology is covering?

297
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,470
All the symptoms?

298
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:31,850
Foot twitching, loathing, drinks, farinaceous food aggravates, vaccination,

299
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,200
gonorrhea suppressed, let's see more.

300
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,170
Philosophy, loss of vision, censorious, critical...

301
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:48,220
So Sulphur it covers, it's not a choice arbitrary which I thought in the beginning

302
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:56,950
when you have a confused case in order to de-confuse it, in order to clarify, in order...

303
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:05,210
You are allowed to give Sulphur. Here we have a confused case that has a lot of

304
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:16,620
symptoms from Sulphur, therefore you are justified absolutely to go to Sulphur.

305
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,480
Very simple remedy but it has not been given so far.

306
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:30,120
But it may put the organism into a better condition,

307
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:35,870
so we may eventually see another remedy appearing.

308
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:41,130
You know the circle, Sulphur, Calcarea, Lycopodium.

309
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:48,130
It may go into that circle of remedies that eventually his body

310
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:53,880
will be more and more organized and balanced.

311
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:14,530
Apart from that, you remember when I read you the paper, on the food it says craves fat,

312
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:24,130
sugar but makes him angry, sugar makes him angry.

313
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:31,540
You remember somebody asked about standing, I did not want to make it

314
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:38,540
too obvious for you asking all the questions for Sulphur but somebody asked

315
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:46,540
because he was thinking of Sulphur also and he said exactly how Sulphur moves around.

316
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,780
He can not stand.

317
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,050
Put a Sulphur to stand in a chair especially, they can not.

318
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:09,120
What about the Aurum? Aurum also is a possibility.

319
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:20,430
He said when I am in a high place, I think of jumping and this reminded us of Aurum

320
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:27,010
in spite of the fact that he has been in such turmoil with his health,

321
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:31,100
he never attended suicide so far.

322
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,120
And he said, suicide no.

323
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:45,500
If that was a case of Aurum, he would have said, yes I thought a lot of times

324
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,850
of killing myself.

325
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:16,600
With this case I would suggest now to start with Sulphur.

326
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:31,250
What potency would you give to him, considering you remember what I told you about his wife,

327
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:37,500
that she had a sensitive organism again, she was abused by allopathic drugs

328
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,510
and we started very low.

329
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:46,500
What about his case?
-High potency.

330
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:53,750
-How high?
-I give him 1M, he is so strong.

331
00:44:53,850 --> 00:45:09,600
-I think we should start no more than 12C.
-200.

332
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:20,410
-I would be very conservative and I would give him 30 and then repeat.

333
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:40,610
-Who is in favor of 12C? Who is in favor of 30? Of 200? Of 1M? Nobody.

334
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:54,340
It is interesting it started with 30, 40 people in favor of 12, 42 in favor of 30, 18

335
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,680
in favor of 200, one in favor...

336
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:04,200
So the majority, I will go with the majority.

337
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:22,570
No. In this case we can start with 200. He comes with a very strong constitutional organism.

338
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:34,600
This man like the AIDS people is very strong and he was abused with medicines and drugs

339
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,340
and that's why he has become like that.

340
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:49,830
His ancestors 90, 92. He is born with a constitution which is strong, he abused

341
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:57,830
that constitution but still the initial strength with which we are born it stays basically.

342
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:06,910
Therefore there is no fear to give 200 or 1M. So I will start with 200

343
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:14,920
and in case it gives no effect, then I will go low, 12X and I will give for a period of time.

344
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:21,850
But I believe the 200 will give some reaction and then some effect where he will feel better

345
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,850
for some time and then he will start again developing some symptomatology

346
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,360
and then I will judge.

347
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:37,700
I will pass judgment whether he will need a repetition or he may go into another remedy.

348
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:50,110
-How come when there is no effect of 200 to go lower instead of going higher?

349
00:47:50,210 --> 00:48:00,190
-This I said it, you are right. When I prescribe a remedy, I prescribe it for good reasons.

350
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:10,860
If a potency does not give me the results which I expect, I will say maybe another potency.

351
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:18,750
His organism is in the frequency of another potency.

352
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:24,610
So if I give high, I will try low, if I give low, I will give high.

353
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:36,680
I do not give up what I have thought so long and so methodically to say it doesn't work,

354
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,860
I will give another remedy.

355
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:44,510
-How long you wait for one dose of Sulphur 200 before you give another one?

356
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:52,430
-One month, at least one month. In his case being particular,

357
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,180
the evaluation should be done within three months.

358
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:02,680
For three months definitely we should let him stay with that remedy

359
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:07,170
and in the end of three months you can evaluate whether the remedy has acted

360
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,280
and how it has acted.

361
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:26,280
It's not so common.

362
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:39,520
Why I was not impressed? Because it's not such uncommon thing.

363
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:47,680
The twitching is more but, as I said, in the beginning of his case

364
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:56,250
there is nothing in particular that had impressed me because when you have a patient like that

365
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:58,250
where he gives a lot of symptoms,

366
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:04,600
he can give anything. His organism can give all kind of symptoms.

367
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:17,250
It's not an organized whole where it gives these, some of the symptoms.

368
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:36,260
His organism is so upset inside that any little aggressiveness from the outside,

369
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:43,590
the dust, the food, the organism is intolerable. It can not tolerate.

370
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:59,490
Unfortunately I don't know when shall we understand these things in Medicine

371
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,350
and stop doing them.

372
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:16,250
They vaccinate such huge numbers and they keep on vaccinating and pushing the chronic diseases

373
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:23,350
more and more inside and bringing out more and more chronic conditions.

374
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:36,910
Where the fear of small pox I don't think there is a possibility for the Western population

375
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:47,250
to get small pox because the organisms are too sick to get small pox anymore.

376
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:56,500
So small pox is out by itself. Who from us gets small pox? Nobody.

377
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:01,860
If there are some healthy ones here and there, they may get small pox.

378
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:11,010
-It seems difficult choice between Sulphur and Natrum Sulphuricum.

379
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:15,240
I see that there are a lot of Natrum Sulphuricum symptoms suppressed,

380
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:26,260
aggravation by humidity and a lot of other things. And because [bad sound]

381
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:38,660
-There is the element of Sulphur and the element of Natrum which in his case,

382
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:44,170
as I said in the beginning, it was the only remedy that I vacillated.

383
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,920
Because they were some symptoms.

384
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:57,160
I would have considered it more in case his depression was directly connected

385
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,920
to the injury to the head.

386
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:05,830
If that was the case, you might have seen me, even with this kind of symptomatology to say,

387
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:09,180
we have to go to Nat Sulphuricum.

388
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:25,420
But there are some symptoms of Sulphur with him, especially worse standing, critical,

389
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:42,500
working with his mind a lot and burning feet, desires fat, sugar.

390
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:50,160
You have a lot of Sulphur symptoms that you can not ignore, you have a confused case,

391
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:55,830
so it fits you to give and you do not have...

392
00:53:55,930 --> 00:54:04,190
As a second possibility, as I said, I will go to Natrum Sulphuricum.

393
00:54:08,430 --> 00:54:15,530
-...to whatever he touches is a kind of characteristic of Sulphur mind?

394
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:19,250
Do you think is important for you to decide for Sulphur?

395
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:26,770
Like Sulphur would smoke too much, drink too much, take whatever he likes too much.

396
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,170
-Not really.
