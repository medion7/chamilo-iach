1
00:00:53,690 --> 00:01:06,090
I have promised that I will see Dr Bennis from Germany, he is a very good homeopath,

2
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:14,090
excellent homeopath and he has sent a case which he was treating, 

3
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,430
it is in your hands now. 

4
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:26,610
A case of a young male 31 years old, married with two daughters, 

5
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,720
who first went for consultation..

6
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:51,370
I had a look and the first look I have seems that the case is incurable,

7
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:58,820
as far as Homeopathy is concerned. We can not do almost anything with this case.

8
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,620
But since I did not have a good look, we are going to look together 

9
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:11,860
and see if we can make a better prescription than the prescription 

10
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:20,150
that was given which was Alumina, Phosphorus and then Alumina phosphorica.

11
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:39,260
It is a case of diabetes, treated with fixed amount of insulin since 1994

12
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:49,620
and then he had a hemorrhage into the corpus vitreum of both eyes, first left,

13
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:57,520
then right since September 1996.

14
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,540
One and a half year before detachment of retina. 

15
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:14,160
So he had detachment of retina and then he had hemorrhage in the eyes

16
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,140
which developed in the 9th of 1996. 

17
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:32,630
Visual aptitude reduced a lot since September 96. Now left nearly blind and 16 to 24...

18
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:48,470
I don't understand what it is.
-Per cent.

19
00:03:52,890 --> 00:04:04,900
-Are you sure? 16 to 24,6 %?
-Yes it is per cent.

20
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:32,150
-The man is almost blind.
-Not at all.

21
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:39,980
-16 % you can see with one eye?
-It's working. 

22
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:49,150
From the clinical examination one would have to say this man is practically blind,

23
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:57,500
the objective examination says this, but subjectively the man says, I can see quite well.

24
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,980
-It's still working, so yes he can see and function.

25
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,900
-A boy who has lost both his eyes and works for the Ministry of Transportation 

26
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
doesn't mean anything.

27
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:19,210
-But he can see still, he can see both his daughters for instance and he can work 

28
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,200
and function with it. He is going to work every day.

29
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:32,450
-What do you mean "can see"? He can see shapes or just barely can differentiate 

30
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,390
whether this is one daughter or the other?

31
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:47,890
That's what you mean. All right. We said almost blind, we didn't say blind.

32
00:05:53,140 --> 00:06:01,040
All answers come out only very difficult, very tenacious, slow moving, 

33
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,060
even the easiest question is answered with great difficulty.

34
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:12,290
So here we have a mental symptom, which we can find in the Repertory.

35
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:30,790
Now you go to the Repertory, you look hemorrhages in the eyes, which is the pathology.

36
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:37,370
Then diabetes. Diabetes and hemorrhages are close to a remedy, 

37
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:49,990
which is called Phosphoric acid. We said yesterday on Phosphoric acid, we have diabetes.

38
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:22,210
We can see the repertorization here. Answers slowly, so by these two  things that we see,

39
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:45,970
diabetes and slow answering, here we see Phosphoric acid is the remedy 

40
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,960
that we have to be thinking.

41
00:07:49,060 --> 00:08:04,630
As we said Phosphoric acid produces diabetes and produces also this slowness, mental slowness,

42
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:12,960
difficult thinking. What is the symptom here?

43
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:37,620
Always answers come out very difficulty, very tenacious, even easy questions are answered 

44
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:44,900
with great difficulty, the more the pressure, the more difficult it gets for him to answer.

45
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,360
He says, I know the answer, some keywords but I can't remember the sentences, 

46
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:59,110
so forgets the words as in Phosphoric acid. 

47
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:13,140
Go to the Repertory and find 'forgets words'. Phosphoric acid capital.

48
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,450
So you are learning Phosphoric acid.

49
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:33,370
You remember when I described Phosphoric acid, I said he tries to remember the word,

50
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:40,440
he wants to say the word "glasses" and he looks at the glasses and he can't remember.

51
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:48,790
He says, 'you wear glasses' finally but it takes a long time to think 

52
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:58,370
and to bring back the words. So actually here it says some keywords that can not remember.

53
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,620
No feeling gets to the surface in an obvious way. 

54
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:09,790
Anger, wants to hit somebody and what comes out in the end is a quiet talk.

55
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:21,800
How you will look for that symptom? No feeling comes to the surface.

56
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:37,130
That means feelings do not surface, do not come out and the man looks quiet.

57
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:55,360
Find the rubric quiet. He is very quiet on the outside. 

58
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:10,700
Look at this rubric. Did you see the rubric? What you see again?

59
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:21,360
You see that Phosphoric acid is again very strong.

60
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:28,600
If I had given you this case for examination...

61
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:35,030
You know what happens if you don't answer correctly. 

62
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:44,680
I don't know how he missed this because the first remedy...

63
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,940
For everything he needs time and preparation, then he can work a lot and well.

64
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,770
If he is surprised or should react spontaneously, he breaks off and stops.

65
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,860
He does not find the words, again. 

66
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,760
Nothing comes out of him. That's why he plans everything.

67
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:16,870
He says, I never get up and just think - let's see what happens.

68
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:40,550
It says that he has to plan carefully what he does, otherwise he can not perform.

69
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:48,110
That means his mind is very slow, his feelings are not existent.

70
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:55,510
There is a kind of slowness of the mind, slowness of the feelings. 

71
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:06,360
He can not remember words, he says, I can't, I try to say a word and I can not find the word.

72
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,260
-The patient together with Dr Bennis, this is what Dr Bennis has sent me.

73
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,260
It is not true that he is got no feelings, he's got very, very strong feelings 

74
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,270
but he can't get them out. He is so angry, he could kill somebody, 

75
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:32,860
it's very strong feelings that he has.

76
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,190
But when he tries to bring those feelings out, on the way 

77
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:49,040
while he is trying to bring them out, then he ends up with this quiet talk.

78
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:59,930
-Exactly and that is why we say to be quiet is not pathology. 

79
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:12,650
To be calm and quiet is nice and it is not pathology. Pathology is when you are not quiet

80
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:20,630
and you are forced by the disease to be quiet. Then it is pathology.

81
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:36,030
Correct? Understood? This is what he says. He can not express any feelings.

82
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:43,780
It is the same thing. It doesn't matter, deep down we know.

83
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,610
Pronounced lack of self-confidence. Look lack of self-confidence.

84
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:12,960
Phosphoric acid is not appearing, fears, dependence, fear of being depending, 

85
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:22,760
that something happens to his children or wife, darkness and spiders. 

86
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,280
Are these fears strong or mild?

87
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,100
-The depending is very strong; the other fear that is very pronounced is that the fear

88
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,440
that something will happen to his wife or children. 

89
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:43,510
For instance if he sees his children running out into the garden, he will immediately connect

90
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:52,350
that with an accident, that some accident will happen to them. He gets the vision of that.

91
00:15:52,450 --> 00:16:04,710
-Put anxiety about others and lack of self-confidence, twice both.

92
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:12,690
Fear of dependence we don't have it as a symptom but here is not a symptom, it is a fact.

93
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,520
He has a fear that he will depend on someone who will take him to lead him 

94
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,870
because he can not see.

95
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:28,020
-But he had that before also, before getting so sick and soft of depending,

96
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,540
he has already had that symptom.

97
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:40,040
-There is no symptom in the Materia Medica but I say in such serious cases,

98
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:49,060
this is a juvenile diabetes, they know the future. 

99
00:16:49,160 --> 00:17:01,710
The future is very bleak, very bad and put fear of darkness underlined once. 

100
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,810
She says it is not so strong.

101
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:17,560
Anxiety about others, twice. He could not pee in front of a lot of people.

102
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:28,790
Whatever he does has to be perfect. Building a toy for the children has to look as if bought.

103
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:36,390
Car clean, obstinate, has a difficulty to not follow his plan.

104
00:17:53,140 --> 00:18:01,370
Desires bread with cheese and sausage without butter, prefers cold food.

105
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:14,710
Prefers cold food, put it twice. Bread with cheese we don't have it as a symptom.

106
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:20,050
We have bread and we have cheese but not bread with cheese.

107
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:26,310
Headache above left eye after straining the eyes.

108
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,980
Put headache above left eye.

109
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:50,900
Worse in the morning, has to sit on the bed for quite a while before he starts seeing something.

110
00:18:53,140 --> 00:19:00,890
Worse after sleep, also you put it underlined twice.

111
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,310
Head pain forehead, that's more correct.

112
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:42,710
I'm just doing this to show you that most probably even if you put all symptoms in the case,

113
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:48,810
once you have put the strong symptoms with underlining them properly, 

114
00:19:50,160 --> 00:20:05,910
the repertorization will insist on Phosphoric acid and will say the remedy is Phosphoric acid.

115
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:19,730
12 symptoms they are put already. Show me the columns.

116
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:32,670
Nux vomica, Phosphoric acid, show me Phosp. acid. 

117
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:53,560
She did not underline properly, answers slowly is very strong, it has to be 3 times,

118
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:08,780
just put it 3 times. Forget words it's so strong, at least 3 times.

119
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:22,810
Quiet disposition also this so strong, 3 times, show me now the analysis.

120
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:41,370
Not only it says Phosphoric acid but there is no other way that you can analyze this case,

121
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,830
you can not give another remedy. The remedy is Phos. acid,

122
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,990
it doesn't matter that it does not cover all the symptoms, 

123
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:56,340
it covers the main symptoms and the main symptoms are strong and this is the remedy.

124
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:09,520
So here in this case, you have a good example of Phos. acid with a difference, 

125
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:21,230
that the pathology underlying such a case is so strong that it is doubtful 

126
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,480
how much you can help such a case. 

127
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:35,170
And because the pathology is sensitive here, you have to be careful of the potency.

128
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:42,770
In this case you really have to be careful of the potency 

129
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:53,250
and what could be the best potency for him? What potency you would suggest for him?

130
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:16,400
Very low like 6X or 6C, medium like 30? How much insulin he needs?

131
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:26,750
-40.
-It's quite a lot.

132
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,250
-What about LN potencies?

133
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:55,590
-I have not been convinced that LN potencies can handle a situation of that type. 

134
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,910
I don't know, I haven't got the experience, I have given it a few times only.

135
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:14,070
I know the potencies how they work in the centesimal, 1 over 100, 

136
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:29,960
so I would suggest in this case 6C, 1/100 6.

137
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,900
-Blood sugar all his life long was really difficult to handle 

138
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:46,250
and after receiving Alumina for the first time in his life he could manage his blood sugar.

139
00:24:51,660 --> 00:25:02,070
-What does that mean? You said blood sugar was unstable, going up and down, 

140
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:08,990
is that correct?
-Yes.

141
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,250
-And after Alumina it steadied to a level, 

142
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,840
is that correct?
-Yes.

143
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:24,490
-The level to which it stayed what it is? Now it's 40 units, before what it was?

144
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:30,180
It was 50, 60 and then 20?

145
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:38,580
-The blood sugar levels in the blood would differ between 350 and 60.

146
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,830
So 350 is far too much and 60 is too little.

147
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:50,570
So before, even though they were giving insulin, it was changeable, very changeable.

148
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:57,320
-Wait a moment. With the same amount of insulin, the readings on the blood 

149
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,820
would be different, is that what he is saying?

150
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:06,080
-I'm trying to say this. Until 1994 he had a fixed amount of insulin 

151
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,650
that he was getting to try to control his blood sugar but it was never possible.

152
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:16,170
Then after 1994 he got flexible amounts ...

153
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:31,420
-No, first consultation in 1996, is this incorrect?

154
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,910
-No, three lines underneath, just read.

155
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,070
-Since 1994 flexible treatment with frequent controls of blood sugar.

156
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:52,820
That means from time to time he would go up to 60 units 

157
00:26:52,920 --> 00:27:01,680
and then come down to 20 units of insulin.

158
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:10,070
Flexible treatment means changing the amount of insulin needed at the moment, 

159
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,250
according to the blood reading.

160
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:24,440
In any case chronologically this does not correspond with the homeopathic treatment.

161
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:32,190
Chronologically it says until 1994... and then flexible treatment with frequent...

162
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:38,990
-George, if you look in the follow ups you will see that before he had either rigid

163
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:44,740
or flexible amounts of insulin but the blood sugar was never able to be controlled.

164
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,760
Then after getting Alumina for the first time in his life 

165
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,990
the blood sugar was never more than 200. 

166
00:27:53,090 --> 00:28:04,910
It was always between 150 and 250 but it never really shot up anymore. 

167
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,510
So her question is, what does that mean concerning Alumina?

168
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:18,660
-Before I can answer what I want to know is when the treatment was flexible,

169
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:26,420
it was coming from 20 units of insulin to 100 units of insulin or what? 

170
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:31,930
This is what I'm asking in order to be able to make an assessment.

171
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:37,910
-What happened was that the amount of insulin actually he could not reduce at all,

172
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:44,320
whether he did it rigidly, with a fixed amount of insulin or whether he did it 

173
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,320
in the way of flexible amounts of insulin.

174
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,990
The only advantage when he put flexible amount of insulin was that he

175
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:58,240
could control his blood sugar a little bit better, so that the peaks of blood sugar 

176
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:07,100
would not be so high anymore. So the amount did not differ.

177
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:14,070
-How is that possible that the amount does not differ if the treatment is flexible?

178
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:18,830
How is that possible? It's not possible for me to comprehend that.

179
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:24,320
Flexible treatment means either you take every second day, 

180
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:34,750
either you take different amounts of insulin every day, this is flexible treatment.

181
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:42,090
-So basically he gets three different types of insulin. 

182
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:48,840
One is the old insulin, the long acting insulin, this is the basic treatment 

183
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,840
and he gets it all the time. 

184
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:58,340
Then to cut the peaks of insulin, he takes some sort acting insulin 

185
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:03,930
and this differs from day to day.

186
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:19,340
-Anyhow, she was asking whether this steadying it means a better situation.

187
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:28,930
I'm not sure, it may mean a worse situation. In order to decide whether it is better

188
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:35,680
or worse it depends on the amount of insulin needed now than before. 

189
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:42,930
If now he needs more amounts of insulin, that whole situation got worse

190
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:48,430
and became steady yes, but before the organism was trying. 

191
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:58,510
Sometimes bringing down, burning the sugar. And the sugar was going down.

192
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:06,500
Now it does not burn the sugar, so you can not say it is better unless you know

193
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:13,500
that before he needed 100 units and after the homeopathic treatment, he needs 40 units.

194
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:21,770
Then we cay say yes it is better, it had an effect on the diabetes. 

195
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:25,760
I don't know if it had an effect on his mental-emotional. 

196
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:37,010
In any case, seeing the case, since you want an advice, I would say without question 

197
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:45,340
I would start this case with Phosphoric acid, I would go to low potency of Phosphoric acid

198
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,380
and give repeatedly three times the day and then this Phosphoric acid, 

199
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,130
I would raise it every week one potency.

200
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:10,120
First week 6C, second week 7C, third week 8C and you go like this 

201
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:21,090
and by the end of three months maybe you can find out 

202
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,940
whether the treatment is giving some positive effect.

203
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:39,430
So three times daily, 6C, 7C, 8C, 9C, 10C...

204
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:54,920
But my question is why I say this? Most probably it is an incurable case.

205
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:59,930
Because it is a juvenile diabetes and when we have a juvenile diabetes,

206
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:05,520
the treatment is very difficult to have an effect. 

207
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:17,020
The pathology is very deep, the pancreas, the islets of Langerhans are totally destroyed,

208
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:25,510
they do not produce any insulin, so how can we improve this situation? 

209
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,110
I'm not sure we can do it.

210
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:40,610
Interesting enough, you remember in Phosphoric acid, just put back Phosphoric acid...

211
00:33:49,620 --> 00:34:00,360
Diabetes in its progress state gives symptoms of Phosphoric acid. 

212
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:15,010
It is a typical pathology of diabetes because it affects the circulation, 

213
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:25,860
the vascular system. You see there? Diabetes.

214
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:39,760
We have the elements, the apathetic, the indifference and the weakness

215
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:45,940
and the emotional progressing to the physical and mental planes. 

216
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,680
The weakness on the emotional level which affects the mental level 

217
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,850
and which affects also the physical level. How it affects? 

218
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:04,930
It affects in this way exactly, as he describes in this case.

219
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:15,680
So it was a good case for learning live something about Phosphoric acid.

220
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:22,090
You remember I described to you how difficult it is to find words. 

221
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:29,600
He says, I can't find words. He says it so clearly as if he is talking on Materia Medica,

222
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,700
Phosphoric acid Materia Medica is this what he is talking.

223
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:45,850
-How do you explain the anger which can not come out? He is very angry.

224
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:52,100
-Be in that state and you will see how..

225
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,860
-I have the same question for apathetic. That means for me 

226
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,760
that there is nothing in and nothing comes out, here there is a lot of emotions inside

227
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,510
but do not come out. It's a big problem.

228
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:24,200
-Yes, here in cases of grief we see really this total flatness of emotions. 

229
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,430
Grief takes away the emotions. 

230
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:35,200
We have a pathology here, we don't have grief, we have a pathology which brings about, 

231
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:45,530
but the total result is the same. He can not express any emotion. His mind is very slow.

232
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:52,530
He cannot find the word, he cannot answer. You go to the repertorization 

233
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:59,460
and you see all these symptoms very strongly on Phosphoric acid.

234
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:06,040
But still now Phosphoric acid will not cure this case.

235
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:12,300
-How can I recognize which potency I have to take?

236
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:23,690
-Here we go low because of the possibility of hemorrhage.

237
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:38,450
A little bit stimulation on the vascular system, on circulation, may produce some hemorrhage.

238
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:45,950
So we have to stimulate as little as possible and slowly.

239
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:50,800
It's like pushing somebody very nicely.

240
00:37:54,300 --> 00:38:11,700
Maybe it can be pushed, it's not sure at all because once an organ is finished,

241
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:21,030
then you can not replace it. Never mind how much you push.

242
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:27,630
Something which is dead will never start working, it will stay there dead.

243
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:34,950
If there is any possibility of regeneration of the pancreas, maybe there is,

244
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,210
I don't know, God knows only. 

245
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:43,960
I'm not in a position to know, but experience shows, 

246
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:51,790
because I have tried several cases of juvenile diabetes, little effect.

247
00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:00,300
-George, what are the other major remedies that you might be thinking of for diabetes?

248
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:08,190
-Best remedy for diabetes is Natrum Sulphuricum and remedies 

249
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:21,790
which have strong desire for sweet things and at the same time they have strong thirst.

250
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:42,700
They can be like Sulphur, Argentum nitricum, Lycopodium. These are remedies for diabetes.

251
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,780
-Uranium nitricum.

252
00:39:44,880 --> 00:40:02,390
-Uranium nitricum yes, when the sugar comes mostly out in the urine.

253
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:07,440
When you have urine loaded with sugar there is a possibility. 

254
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:13,530
I have tried the Uranium nitricum several times, I have not seen the effect. 

255
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:20,280
Maybe we don't have enough information to prescribe more accurately the remedy.

256
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,530
It is true, it is written like this.

257
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:27,780
-What about (?) It's often suggested.

258
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,530
-I don't know.

259
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,380
-I don't also know.

260
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:46,620
-But I have seen simple cases of diabetes, when diabetes starts at the age of 40, 45, 50

261
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:55,380
and they come early, the best remedy is Natrum sulphuricum in the beginning, 

262
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:04,460
Sulphur is a second remedy, Argen. nitricum is another remedy, Lycopodium is another remedy 

263
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:14,460
and Phosphoric acid once the effects of diabetes have gone into the vascular system 

264
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:21,650
and they produce a similar state like this. This is too strong.

265
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:31,050
If you can imagine the effort of this man to survive, the will power 

266
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:43,380
that he exercises every day. His mind is totally empty, can not receive and react.

267
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,370
You can understand. 

268
00:41:46,980 --> 00:42:06,300
He says, I know the answers... for everything he needs time and preparation.

269
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:13,050
Then he can work a lot and well. If he is surprised or should be react, forget it.

270
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:20,790
He breaks off and stops short. He does not find the words. Nothing comes out of him. 

271
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:36,800
Never mind these remarks, I described to you how the person tries to say a word,

272
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:46,790
even he sees the object and he can not bring the word to his mind. 

273
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:54,790
I look at the telephone and the word is totally gone on my mind.

274
00:42:54,890 --> 00:43:14,390
And they try..... telephone. It takes so long. They look at it..... Glasses. 

275
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,550
You see how slow it is?

276
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:25,560
It is described here, it's very beautiful, Phosphoric acid in Materia Medica.

277
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,800
It can not be better, I could not have described it better. 

278
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:42,310
Here you write first hand and then what he says, quiet, I come out and I'm quiet!

279
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:48,140
Many times I have said what is quiet? It's not good to have quiet? 

280
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:57,010
It's good but when it's pathology, because of pathology you are quiet, then that is a symptom,

281
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:00,800
this is the symptom, this is the situation.

282
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:08,990
I have become very quiet, because of pathology, it's not my type. 

283
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,390
And then it's a change, then it's pathology. 

284
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:23,220
In spite of the fact this is considered to be a healthy quality. 

285
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:35,220
If somebody is calm inside and because of this calmness he feels quiet and never gets mad,

286
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:41,730
it's very fine, it's very good, this level is very healthy.

287
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:53,470
He says, I'm quiet because I can not do otherwise and perceives deep down inside some anger,

288
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:57,070
whatever it might be, feelings etc.
