1
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:33,160
Since 2006 treated with Medorrhinum, Lachesis, Phosphorus and Lycopodium.

2
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:42,391
With Stramonium 200C, that was last year. She is in general quite well.

3
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:49,677
The fits of rage are less, the mother says.

4
00:00:50,349 --> 00:01:00,918
It’s because there is less pressure now in the private school. She attributes it to that.

5
00:01:01,918 --> 00:01:06,591
A good development of her personality. She seems to be more independent,

6
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:12,247
stays alone for hours, meets friends for shopping,

7
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:18,567
she does not like taking decisions by her own.

8
00:01:22,318 --> 00:01:31,903
Ask her what she is indecisive in? Even for little things?

9
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:40,109
– Always asking her mother, what should I do, what should I say. You should say.

10
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:46,823
– Is this correct?
– But sometimes when she goes shopping with her friends

11
00:01:47,598 --> 00:01:53,758
she shops alone.
– She decides.

12
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,069
– When shopping with her girlfriends.
– But when the mother is present

13
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:08,678
she will ask the opinion of the mother.
– Yes, the mother says.

14
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:21,382
– You don’t seem to agree.
– It’s ok but I never went shopping with her mother.

15
00:02:21,854 --> 00:02:32,230
– When you shop with her, she asks you to decide?
– Not every time.

16
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:38,094
Sometimes when she likes something she takes it and asks can I take it and then I say ok.

17
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:46,710
– Her decision is her own?
– She decides, yes.

18
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:57,190
– In a certain point it might be normal that the girl always asks her mother,

19
00:02:57,542 --> 00:03:02,686
what do you think mom? I was the same when I was a child.

20
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:15,061
– She is reasonable, reliable more than others in her age.

21
00:03:16,374 --> 00:03:26,486
She had 3 times fever in the last year. Once 39,9C with vomiting.

22
00:03:26,936 --> 00:03:32,046
What was this last acute without taking any remedies?

23
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:37,054
– I think once when he gave her Belladonna and this acted properly.

24
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:46,893
– One time Belladonna 30C and on the next day fever was gone.

25
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:54,502
– Do you know what it was? Tonsils inflamed? What was the reason for this?

26
00:03:55,118 --> 00:04:01,038
– She came back from school and told me that she is tired and we went home

27
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:14,375
and then at 18:00 she had fever increasing and then I went for Belladonna

28
00:04:15,494 --> 00:04:20,774
and on the next day fever was gone. I don’t know why the fever came?

29
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:26,166
– She didn’t complain of pain in the throat.

30
00:04:26,646 --> 00:04:32,118
– No pain. She was tired, she came back from school very tired and wanted to sleep

31
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:47,230
– So they stopped the hormones?</br>– Yes.

32
00:04:52,438 --> 00:05:01,054
– We stopped the hormones last year in July. But I didn’t tell it to the doctor in Austria.

33
00:05:16,497 --> 00:05:22,113
– Sweating easily. Where does she sweat mostly?</br>– On the head.

34
00:05:27,153 --> 00:05:31,017
– The hair or the face?</br>– In the hair.

35
00:05:32,601 --> 00:05:40,730
– In her sleep?</br>– On the back. Not a lot in the night. On the back maybe

36
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:43,882
– She is lazy?</br>– Yes

37
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:47,241
– She admits she is lazy?</br>– Yes.

38
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:55,577

39
00:05:56,417 --> 00:06:07,081
– She does not like to study.</br>– She doesn’t like to do homework or anything.

40
00:06:09,465 --> 00:06:12,865
– But this year she was in a private school

41
00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:24,201
and the name of this school is Socrates school in Austria.

42
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:30,201
There are no lessons or homework to do at home.

43
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:35,265
– They let the children do whatever they like?

44
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:39,697
Be free and develop their own initiatives and their own ideas.

45
00:06:40,402 --> 00:06:44,721
– It was one year of holidays for her.</br>– She likes school?

46
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:50,609

– Has she noticed in her sleep whether she sticks her feet out of covers?

49
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:27,658
– Yes. She has hot feet.</br>– When the reaction is like that, I say it for the class,

50
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:37,409
you take it into consideration because she gives it with a very confirmative mood.

51
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:50,466
Her self-confidence is not very high. She has fears of phoning somebody

52
00:07:50,993 --> 00:08:00,130
or fear of new situations or people. Other fears are of thunderstorms,

53
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:24,050
fear for test in school. And she needs some light when going to bed.

54
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:33,321
Sometimes complaining nobody loves me, has aversion against explanations, mostly.

55
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:43,433
What is this?</br>– Her mother says, she tries to explain her

56
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:47,521
that it’s necessary to do  homework or something

57
00:08:48,761 --> 00:09:00,169
and she dislikes to have such conversations, advices.

58
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:14,794
– Her things are in place or is she sloppy? Throws her things here and there in the room,

59
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:26,859
the room is like bombarded?</br>– Five days she is sloppy and then she is making order

66
00:10:24,137 --> 00:10:31,529
Not so much anymore. She likes shrimps.

00:10:31,794 --> 00:10:40,250

68
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:49,761

69
00:10:55,561 --> 00:11:02,225
– Often feels very hot. Love water even when the water is ice cold.

70
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:13,426

75
00:11:47,377 --> 00:11:50,353
– When she is tired she quickly falls asleep.

76
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:57,914
When she is not so tired she is reading a book for a quarter of an hour.

77

– What kind of books she reads? Romantic or?</br>– Esoteric books.

78
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:30,226

82

12 hours of sleep. – On the weekend sometimes she sleeps at 11:00 p.m.

83
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:34,674
and then wakes up at 10:00, 11:00 a.m.

84
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:45,769
– She is constipated sometimes. Stool every 2-3 days only.

85
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:58,273
I don’t understand every 2-3 days...</br>- Sometimes she misses 2 or 3 days.

86
00:13:58,745 --> 00:14:07,130
– The stool is formed or unformed?</br>– It changed when we stopped the hormones.

87
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:13,305
When we took hormones, it took sometimes 4 or 5 days

88
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:23,354
but now the stool is every 2 days. It is formed.

100
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:23,681
– She is 11, yes. In her class are boys and girls together?

101
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:31,074
– Yes, there are boys and girls, younger and older children, they are all together.

102
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,114
From 6 to 10 years old.

103
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:43,145
– But also boys 15, 16 years old.</br>– Not so old.

104
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:50,937
This school started last year in September, for the first time.

105
00:16:54,033 --> 00:17:02,401
– She likes any of the boys in her class?</br>– No.

106
00:17:04,745 --> 00:17:08,329
– From higher classes?

107
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:23,049
– In this school there is only one class with younger children and older. From 6 to 12.

108
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:33,826
– She likes anybody in her neighborhood?</br>– Yes. His name is Philip,

109
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:42,425
he is as old as she but he is very small. They play together.

110
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:50,522
– He is just a friend she says, not a boyfriend.

111
00:17:58,649 --> 00:18:13,106
– She likes the company of children of her age, younger or older age?</br>– At her age.

112
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:28,488
– If there is some fat in the meat, will she eat it or she will take it out?

113
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:34,962
– If there is a big piece of fat she will take it away. A little bit can stay.

114
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:59,186
– In general she is shy?</br>– Sometimes, not in every situation.

115
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:12,801
– She cries easily sometimes?</br>– Sometimes.

116
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:22,858
– She likes butter?</br>– Not so much.

117
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:28,025
– Milk?</br>– In the breakfast with cereals, yes.

118
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:39,593
– Meat she likes?</br>– Chicken.

119
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:55,848
– The best. What about pork?</br>– No.

120
00:19:58,593 --> 00:20:09,272
– When she is not feeling well and somebody goes to console her, how does she feel?

121
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:23,929
– She likes consolation.</br>– She needs a hug.

122
00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:34,017
Her organism seems to be in a much better condition in general.

123
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:46,017
She went out of the aggression state which was due to imbalance in the hormones.

124
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:52,393
The hormones seem to be quite balanced at this moment

125
00:20:53,050 --> 00:21:04,225
and the remedy appears to be quite clear and most of you know the remedy.

126
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:38,313
Who knows the remedy? You don’t know the remedy yet but it needs some experience,

127
00:21:38,945 --> 00:21:49,458
to see many cases and then you will be able to recognize quite fast the remedy

128
00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:59,217
which is of this type. It’s one of the well-known remedies, it’s a remedy that is very hot,

129
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:14,434
likes to be bathed in cold water, cold makes her feels good and feet out of covers

130
00:22:14,826 --> 00:22:30,609
because they are burning during sleep. She likes consolation, she does not like fat.

131
00:22:37,345 --> 00:22:41,521
Who knows the remedy this time?

132
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:49,617
What happens is that you are mixing with a lot of other points

133
00:22:50,321 --> 00:22:55,698
which makes you side tracked from the remedy.

134
00:22:56,937 --> 00:23:05,097
You are taking into consideration what about that she is lazy for instance.

135
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:18,849
So we are quite right the case for me when I first saw just for a while it looked like Sulph.

136
00:23:19,218 --> 00:23:33,185
But Sulph. was not confirmed on its keynotes. I would expect to hear I eat the fat,

137
00:23:37,785 --> 00:23:43,497
give me meat with fat. No, she did not say that.

138
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:57,793
She also had some others symptoms of Sulph. Sulph. does not like fish very much.

139
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:05,609
So you could have confused it because I was thinking of it for quite some time

140
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:18,514
that Sulph. is the remedy. When you investigate a case then this is very important

141
00:24:18,945 --> 00:24:24,929
and you have an idea of a remedy and you investigate according to this idea,

142
00:24:25,442 --> 00:24:34,400
do not stick to this idea. Let always doubt yourself whether this is correct or not

143
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:37,431
and you want more and more confirmation.

144
00:24:38,072 --> 00:24:42,248
The moment that you search in this way the truth will come.

145
00:24:43,016 --> 00:24:55,095
Maybe Sulph. will come next as a remedy. Maybe the laziness is quite strong like Sulph.

146
00:24:56,256 --> 00:25:14,392
and it will come up. Show me the analysis. Want of self-confidence.

147
00:25:17,192 --> 00:25:34,128
Also this kind of fears she has and the hesitation to decide is more for Puls. than for Sulph.

148
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:47,648
Puls. is not sure about herself. Wants the confirmation and the support of others,

149
00:25:48,007 --> 00:26:08,768
the opinion of others. Want of self-confidence. Ingrowing toe nails.

150
00:26:10,856 --> 00:26:23,879
Show me ingrowing toe nails. Sulph. is on second degree where Puls. is not.

151
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:45,056
Show me aversion fish. Graph. and Sulph. is strong while Puls. is not there.

152
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:56,791
Sleep prolonged. Sulph. is there. Puls. is not there.

153
00:26:57,616 --> 00:27:13,589
But forsaken feeling. Puls. Put it on third degree. Puls. will be even stronger.

154
00:27:18,052 --> 00:27:25,060
Consolation ameliorates. Without consolation ameliorates still Puls. comes first.

155
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:37,844
Show me the results. Puls. and Sulph. is second. Puls. is strong.

156
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:48,996
Most probably the underlying layer is Sulph. which will come up later on.

157
00:27:50,316 --> 00:28:12,045
Puls. 200C and Puls. 1M next day and we wait. Easy case. This was an easy case now.

158
00:28:12,356 --> 00:28:19,348
In the beginning it was a very difficult case to start. But we started it correctly

159
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:28,444
and therefore the development was such that this case could be helped.

160
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:32,508
Otherwise it is considered a very deep pathology.

161
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:45,742
Not easy to be treated with Homeopathy. So, do you have some questions?

162
00:28:55,959 --> 00:29:05,055
– You think that Stram. clarified the case.</br>–  Yes. Stram. pushed the case.

163
00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:12,063
All the remedies, so far, have been doing something good for her organism

164
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:20,975
until now where she is normal.

165
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:32,271
The last time she had much more aggression for which Stram. was given

166
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:36,175
and has helped her quite a lot.

167
00:29:43,335 --> 00:29:51,855
– Why do you ask if she likes to play with children at the same age, younger or older?

168
00:29:52,087 --> 00:30:07,719
– Good question. When we first saw her at the age of 5 she was interested in boys.

169
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:26,255
Do you understand? She had the instinct of a woman, already.

170
00:30:27,815 --> 00:30:33,151
Because she was driven by the hormonal imbalance

171
00:30:34,128 --> 00:30:41,743
and by checking this I checked the balance in the hormonal level.

172
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:54,959
The normal is to be interested at 11, maybe. But she is totally normal now.

173
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:07,591
The androgens are not high. This was the meaning of my questions

174
00:31:08,022 --> 00:31:14,374
and I insisted on that in order to understand exactly what is going on.

175
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:29,127
Can you give it back?</br>– Why next day Puls. 1M and not only 200C?

176
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:41,302
– You are aggressive!</br>– I have emotions. I am not aggressive.

177
00:31:41,831 --> 00:31:46,951
– I am joking. If you were aggressive you would jump on me,

178
00:31:47,743 --> 00:31:56,863
then I would have a problem. The other day you made a good remark.

179
00:31:58,231 --> 00:32:03,191
Why did you give this and not that, I remember that. With Thuja.

180
00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:12,591
– I saw Thuja but in the second level.</br>– Which was a good remark

181
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:25,847
because there were strong points for Puls. I give now because I am afraid…

182
00:32:32,935 --> 00:32:40,566
you rely on one potency ok, maybe it is not properly potentized

183
00:32:41,415 --> 00:32:47,103
so if you give 200C maybe nothing happens. For a year nothing will happen

184
00:32:47,582 --> 00:32:54,214
so you take one more. In this organism I can give them,

185
00:32:54,670 --> 00:33:05,367
even if both are good she can take the aggravation if there is any.

186
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:17,882
– I want to ask whether she needs a remedy. If we didn’t give her a remedy at all

187
00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:22,074
because she is balanced now and the hormones…

188
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:36,769
- That’s correct and you can say she does not need a remedy but the case is quite clear,

189
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:46,946
the problem is quite deep, I do not consider it as totally completed

190
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:55,193
and if this organism shows me the next remedy I will prescribe it.

191
00:34:04,802 --> 00:34:15,161
The idea is now that she has to have normal menses

192
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:25,954
so it’s a little bit early the menses came she already had two times

193
00:34:32,234 --> 00:34:48,522
so Puls. will regulate even further.</br>– In her case I think there is another observation

194
00:34:49,426 --> 00:34:58,601
that it worked very well. She is quite tall.

195
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:08,706
– She is growing normally, finally.

196
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:16,977
And maybe I have predicted she will be taller than her father, finally.

197
00:35:18,505 --> 00:35:25,585
The reason is, I know this from the experience with children treated homeopathically

198
00:35:26,738 --> 00:35:35,530
invariably they grow higher than their parents, to be taller. I don’t know why.

199
00:35:36,081 --> 00:35:42,489
It seems that there is some inhibition on the gentic level

200
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:55,793
and I have seen children of parents who are really short 155 cm.

201
00:36:02,282 --> 00:36:13,025
I remember a child I was treating with Tourette syndrome for a long period of time

202
00:36:13,937 --> 00:36:29,113
and she became a soccer player in one of the main teams in Athens and was 192 cm.

203
00:36:31,217 --> 00:36:38,962
But invariably all the children I have treated for long time, not just once,

204
00:36:39,745 --> 00:36:52,467
those who came again and again they grew up to be high tall. Thank you.
