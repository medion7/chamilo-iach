1
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:36,050
-After Ignatia I desire more fruits but it started 7-8 weeks after

2
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,390
and I also got back a strong desire for alcohol, so I was drinking every day

3
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,230
for about a month.

4
00:00:49,480 --> 00:01:03,220
This problem with my spine is very big because there is a curve and the hips are rotated

5
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:14,390
I have a lot of pain in connection with that, the osteoporosis has been worse

6
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,240
for the last year.

7
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,390
-Did you check it?
-I checked it.

8
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,220
-How? By X-ray?

9
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:27,390
-Yes and I was hopeful thinking that will be better because of taking several remedies

10
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,820
but I was very depressed after that.

11
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:39,990
-Are you sure he was a good X-ray, he gave you the right examination?

12
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,830
Because it’s not so easy to see it.

13
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,740
-He compared to the first one and he saw the difference.

14
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:59,720
After Medorrhinum I have been extra sensitive to voices and noises, very annoying,

15
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,570
so I isolated very much.

16
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:18,160
I had a period when I had as if the kidneys were swollen and pains in the kidneys.

17
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,320
-How do you know they are in the kidneys and not in the lumbar region?

18
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:32,770
-I had pyelonephritis before, so I recognized the pain.

19
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:53,300
I postpone everything, very much, so I’m always late, always in a hurry

20
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:03,330
and it’s like an aversion to think and work.

21
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:10,070
-And make decisions.
-Yes, because of this fatigue.

22
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:21,220
I took a lot of antibiotics when I was younger because of the pyeloneprhitis

23
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:31,830
and a lot of cystitis and last year I have a lot of falling out of hair.

24
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:52,570
And the menses I got back some PMS problems after Ignatia, I had earlier.

25
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:05,050
-The premenstrual which is exactly? You are angry, irritable or weepy before menses?

26
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,490
-More the pains.

27
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:13,150
-Pain and swelling of breast.

28
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:25,570
-And I do have a lot of stitching, burning pains in the glands and they are very indurated.

29
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,280
-Have you been in a specialist?

30
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:43,480
-They took an X-ray and they cannot tell much because it is so indurated,

31
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:49,670
so it’s hard to see. But the pain is like being stung by a bee.

32
00:04:50,670 --> 00:05:03,640
A lot of my pains are like that smarting and the menses stop when I lie down, always did.

33
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,330
-When you lie down the menses stop and then continue?

34
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,820
-Yes.

35
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:15,760
-That means, if you sleep the whole night they stop and you had it your whole life?

36
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,770
-Yes.

37
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:42,030
-Lilium Tigrinum, Pulsatilla, Silica…

38
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:57,180
Do you have a prolapse of the uterus?
-No, I don’t think so.

39
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,620
I’m still very depressed.

40
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,620
-Other? You said everything?
-I’m not sure, it’s just chaos.

41
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:39,360
After these dreams it was like a therapeutic thing because I’m not so hateful

42
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,460
towards myself anymore and I stopped biting the nails.

43
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:50,620
Before I was like scratching and wounds in my hand, I had it for 20 years.

44
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,200
-And you don’t bite your nails?

45
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:05,200
-Not anymore but I did for 42 years, so I feel all this aggressiveness

46
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,280
and the hate towards myself is better.

47
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,680
-It is released.
-So I think that’s important.

48
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:24,890
-I think it’s good, don’t give all the information because everybody will know your remedy.

49
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:40,130
-Tell us what happened? What was the last remedy that you had and what happened?

50
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:48,280
-I got Ignatia 200 in September but I got Medorrhinum after that.

51
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,720
-And you got Medorrhinum when?

52
00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:02,880
-I wrote you because of sleeplessness mostly and I was told to take Medorrhinum 200.

53
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:12,670
-What date?
-I took it in middle of December.

54
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,570
-Did you write to me?
-I wrote to Angy.

55
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:35,070
-And you said mostly I have sleeplessness. Tell me after Ignatia what happened?

56
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:44,990
-This grief with this young boy that I have been for 2 years, it slowly faded.

57
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:55,490
So it was good, I had some relief and I noticed the sighing has been better.

58
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:12,490
And immediately after taking Ignatia I got very much hunger, increased appetite.

59
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:23,070
For warm food especially and I was craving a lot of sweets and I gained 6-7 kilos.

60
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,900
-You like it?
-Not really.

61
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:40,280
I have to buy new clothes and I was eating a lot of different things

62
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,950
that I don’t normally do, so I had a lot of digestive problems coming up.

63
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:51,900
-What did you eat?
-Everything but meat I don’t eat.

64
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,220
-Continue, what else have you done?

65
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:10,470
-The feeling of hurry was prominent after Ignatia, I was very restless and in hurry.

66
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,130
And I think I wrote that also because you read the whole letter I wrote  to Angy,

67
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,220
so I think it was several more things, not just sleeping problems.

68
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,950
-You don’t have a copy of this letter?
-No.

69
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,640
-Angy must have one.

70
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:47,710
-I felt more exhaustion and fatigue and this got more strong but I don’t think

71
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:59,060
I told you last time, maybe I didn’t explain how strong really is, the chronic fatigue.

72
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:08,290
It’s been more than 20 years and I don’t think it came through enough

73
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,140
and this got worse and worse.

74
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:15,890
-What got worse?
-This fatigue.

75
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:21,800
After being in a hurry for several weeks, when I came home I tried like clean up

76
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:29,800
all this chaos that were in my house and I tried to get myself to do a lot of things

77
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,630
and after 2 weeks I was also caput, exhausted completely.

78
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,120
-And you started not being able to sleep?
-Yes.

79
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:48,270
That started almost immediately after but sleeping problems has been a big issue my whole life,

80
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:57,720
but I had been better maybe 3-4 years I’ve been able to be well without sleeping pills and before that

81
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,560
I had it for almost 20 years, I had been on sleeping pills.

82
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:12,210
So it was a little bit better but now it came back very strong, so I can sleep about 2 hours

83
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:19,840
and then that’s was it, I can not go back. So it’s exhaustion, it’s worse and worse.

84
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,650
So after a month, I wrote this letter.

85
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:34,300
-And then I told you to take Medorrhinum. What happened after Medorrhinum?

86
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:50,180
-The sleep problems got even worse but it changed a little bit, so I did not wake up

87
00:12:50,280 --> 00:13:01,380
after 2 hours, I could sleep up to 4 hours, from 1 to 4 hours but it was such a restlessness.

88
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:20,730
So it was not 4 hours, I wake up all the time and with pains like cystitis and urithritis.

89
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:26,730
So I had to run from 6-7 to 15 times to urinate.

90
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:31,380
-In the night?
-Yes.

91
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:40,980
-For how long it lasted this?
-It was almost 7-8 weeks.

92
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:50,460
So it has been 4 months now with the sleep problems, I was very exhausted,

93
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:57,300
almost feeling I’m going crazy. I can not take anymore but I took no sleeping pills,

94
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,820
I was drinking some alcohol.

95
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:11,080
-What about now? The sleeping pattern is it better?

96
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:17,550
-After 6-7 weeks it got a little better but the restlessness is there

97
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:22,900
and I’ve been having so many nightmares.

98
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:31,740
And also I had these compulsive thoughts, I was tormenting with a lot of compulsive thoughts.

99
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,000
-Like?

100
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:40,070
-Things came up, a lot of emotional things, that has been there but it got so strong,

101
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,000
so extreme, everything got so extreme.

102
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,160
-What were the thoughts?

103
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:52,670
Do you want to say?
-It was like a religious despair.

104
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:06,260
-Whether you had made a sin?
-I felt guilty of a crime.

105
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:20,490
-Your mind went to a specific action of yours or it was abstract?

106
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:29,010
-No, this fatigue makes me not able to do anything, so it’s like throwing my life away.

107
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,250
-But why do you have guilt feelings? Because you are fatigued?

108
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,990
-Yes.

109
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:44,380
-Are you sure?
-By now I should be able to heal myself.

110
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:57,860
-How can you heal yourself? It’s easy to say. To heal myself is a big word.

111
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,050
-But…

112
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:08,540
-Anyhow can you tell me the nightmares, what was the content of the nightmares?

113
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:18,030
Do you remember? If you don’t want to say something, you can say I don’t like to say.

114
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,890
-I think it’s important to say.

115
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:32,780
It was mostly being pursued, I have to run away from something, trying to escape from something

116
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:40,280
and it was so strong because I’ve been writing down my dreams for 10 years

117
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,100
and I usually remember but not like these.

118
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:51,030
It was so intense, so vivid, so I could have 4-5 dreams every night.

119
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,940
-And all these dreams were nightmares, were frightening?

120
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:09,770
-Most of them. A lot of them was about sexual abuse in my childhood that came up

121
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:13,380
seemed to be like suppressed things.

122
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,460
The fatigue got very… These dreams have such an impact on me.

123
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:31,460
I felt so weak, I can not stand on my legs, I just want to lie in this position and put the cover.

124
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,960
I was nauseous for several days after these dreams.

125
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,300
-After Medorrhinum you mean?
-After the dreams.

126
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:51,950
-But the dreams, the main theme was sexual abuse and somebody is trying to

127
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,310
come after you or to get you?

128
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:02,770
-Yes and I try everything to escape, I wake up screaming no, no, no and throwing

129
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:09,160
with a terrible pain in my neck and I have a headache from that.

130
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:17,070
-Do you remember scenes from childhood or you have suppressed them?

131
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:26,770
-I don’t remember anything from my childhood, everything is black up to 15-16 and

132
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:33,360
mostly after 18. Before 18 I don’t remember much.

133
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,200
-Even now, after the remedy?

134
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:43,030
-After the remedies I have some flashbacks and I have some things coming up that

135
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:57,040
I suddenly feel I’m baby again, a child again. It’s weird, I want teddy bears.

136
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:05,390
-You want protection?
-Yes protection and I sit a lot like rocking.

137
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:19,690
-Why do you think you feel like that? Do you know? Why you want protection,

138
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,460
you feel like a baby, do you know why?

139
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:34,190
-Not really but I always felt that I want to manage myself, never seeking that protection.

140
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:41,280
-And now you feel that need for protection, now?

141
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:53,780
-Somehow when these incidents come up, I went to bed one night and I felt suddenly

142
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:02,030
I could not move, I felt I was this baby, I was looking around and trying to get away

143
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:09,210
from something, it was just a shadow I could not see and after that I just cried and cried.

144
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,720
This is something I feel I don’t want to touch.

145
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,220
-You don’t want the experience again.

146
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:33,110
-No, I can talk about it but I feel mentally I can but to take the emotions is difficult.

147
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:43,370
-It’s painful. Do you want to cry now? Do you have the tendency to cry?

148
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:56,870
-More before I started. And every time somebody wants to kill me and I run and run and people

149
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:05,210
want to kill me and I get wounded and even if I’m wounded I’m limping and people come after me.

150
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:19,370
And a lot of dreams when I’m a child, a little girl with all kinds of things done to me,

151
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:30,810
just seeing a face with a big wound and things like that, mutilating things.

152
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:39,030
So I don’t want to go to sleep because I’m thinking what is coming up now,

153
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,300
what do I have to face tonight.

154
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,950
-The nightmares are every day?

155
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:53,870
-Yes but since I came here I slept so little, so I had no hardly any dreams this time

156
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,670
because I hardly sleep.

157
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,720
-What else do you have in your notes?

158
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:23,190
-I also had an increase of this animal thing, all kind of tormenting the same compulsiveness

159
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:35,840
came with that, I always had this love for animals but now it was so compulsive all the time

160
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:42,930
for day and night for several weeks and so it faded and after that it’s gone better.

161
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,010
-So it was a love of animals for a period of time?

162
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:56,920
-I always love but after Medorrhinum this came so strong and all these things I have to

163
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:06,170
take small flies who go in the water and they lie there, I have to save them and I take them up

164
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:11,340
and blow them, all the time.

165
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:17,660
At my home there are a lot of frogs and I can hardly drive the cars because

166
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,360
I don’t want to kill them, a lot of things like that.

167
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:27,830
-But now it’s not so strong anymore this sensitivity.

168
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:34,330
-It’s there but it’s not this compulsiveness and the same with this despair I have

169
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:42,430
with this religious. It was very strong for some weeks but now it faded, so now it’s better.

170
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,940
I sensed that I had more fears.

171
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,580
-What kind?
-About dogs.

172
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:22,090
I had a little before but now I freeze, big dogs, aggressive ones and fear of heights is stronger

173
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,270
because I didn’t have so much anxiety and fears before.

174
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,170
-From high places you didn’t mind before, almost.

175
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:42,860
-Not so much, a little bit, but now fears.

176
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,100
-What other fears?

177
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:56,590
-Of talking in public and to people, more afraid of people and of suffocation,

178
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:02,690
especially underneath the water I feel like I don’t have breath.

179
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,610
-Did you swim while you are here, did you swim at all?

180
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:21,310
-Very fast, just once a little bit. I love the sea, I want to dive but I’m afraid to go underneath

181
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,860
because I don’t feel that I can breathe.

182
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:54,250
I think that’s it. Another thing I didn’t mention last time, it has become a little stronger.

183
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:05,690
It’s a pressure in the head and behind the eyes when I’m ascending, if I stares here.

184
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,260
-Like a headache?
-No.

185
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:25,200
It’s like a lot of blood in the head and dizziness and disturbed vision and I have to stop.

186
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:33,380
I can hear the pulse and palpitation in the ear, very exhausted.

187
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:50,780
After Medorrhinum I had a couple of warts, small ones, in here but very small

188
00:26:50,880 --> 00:27:01,210
and a couple of others I have here got a little bigger, moles are changing and itching.

189
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:10,360
I got back some pain in the right ovary that I had a lot years back

190
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,460
but it was just for a short while.

191
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:34,970
-You had some stitching pain there.
-And sometimes I’m so exhausted after eating.

192
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,870
-You eat much more now.
-Yes.

193
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:55,130
-Do you still have the aggravation from sugar?
-Yes, still there.

194
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,210
The aggravation is still there.

195
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,960
-As much as it was before or less?

196
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,200
-I’m not quite sure because if I eat a lot of sugar the reaction is not that strong

197
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:21,470
but if I don’t anything and take sugar, then the reaction is very strong as well.

198
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,950
-If you take only sugar. Other sweets do you take?

199
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,550
Chocolates?
-Yes.

200
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,630
-No reaction?
-Yes, all sweets.

201
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:40,610
-Also you had diarrhea from emotional excitement, do you remember?

202
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:47,800
-No, I don’t remember I told you but yes that is true, I can have that.

203
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:01,950
I’m much better in fresh air, I can not stand stuffy rooms, the feeling

204
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:18,450
of not having enough oxygen… but I don’t think I told you so much last time

205
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:32,530
about I had an injury in my head and the whole spine in 1985 and I fell down 2,5 meters

206
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:37,700
on rocks and I hit my head and the spine.

207
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,890
-You were in the hospital?
-No.

208
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,370
-You took no medicines?

209
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:49,120
-I took some pain killers but it didn’t work, the chiropractor didn’t want to touch me

210
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,060
because he said that’s too serious.

211
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,720
-So you stayed in bed?
-Yes, it was terrible for years.

212
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:06,980
-What did you have? Pains?
-Yes, especially in the neck.

213
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:16,730
-But you have told us last time that you have a headache in the occiput.

214
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,990
Is that what you mean?

215
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:27,140
-The headache in the occiput usually comes when I have this headache, when that is aggravated.

216
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,140
-And when this pain is aggravated?

217
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,150
-Very much during sleep and from the nightmares, as if I’m fighting all night.

218
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,570
-How about the coldness on feet?

219
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:49,300
-It’s still there or your feet are warm now?

220
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:59,220
-I had a period where it was a little bit warmer but I’m still cold, easily clammy.

221
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,720
-Easily perspire on foot?
-Yes.

222
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,980
-In general you feel cold?

223
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:29,730
-Yes, definitely. I have 2 big blankets and I use 2 wool blankets and socks,

224
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,160
I’m really freezing cold.

225
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:40,320
-You use some heat in your room or no heat?

226
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:50,000
-I turn the heat off during the night because it gets too stuffy.

227
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:05,980
-And here with this weather you use blankets in the night?

228
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,320
-3 blankets.

229
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,890
-And your feet are still cold, you wear socks?

230
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:22,330
-Yes but I had some flashes of heat in the night after Medorrhinum.

231
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:27,660
I wanted to stick the feet out for a short time but then I had to put them back.

232
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:34,070
So I get very aggravated to take the cover off, even though I am warm.

233
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,370
-You have to be careful because easily you get cold.

234
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:49,300
-Yes and especially if I sit still, I can get warmer and perspire very easily

235
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:58,330
if I have to walk a little bit and even slow walk but if I have to sit or lie down, I get cold.

236
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,310
-And if you walk you perspire immediately?

237
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:21,150
-Very easy. But I feel heat in my head usually, the head is warm and I want it cooler.

238
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,990
-You need the head cooler.
-Yes.

239
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:30,750
-Are you very fastidious?

240
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:15,160
-These memory problems I think got worse after the injury to my head.

241
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:24,740
The memory problem is not any better but I feel better with the confusion, a little bit.

242
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,590
-Maybe.

243
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:40,520
-But still difficult to concentrate, I can even push myself very hard.

244
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,750
-How is your menses?

245
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:51,580
-The menses after Ignatia was delayed a little bit and it was even more scanty

246
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,520
and it’s only 1 day.

247
00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:00,500
-How they are now?
-About the same.

248
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:08,350
-Scanty with clear blood or black?
-Clear blood.

249
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,430
-How is your thirst?
-I drink quite a lot.

250
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:26,510
I used to drink very little before but it was after some remedy, 2 years ago I took Arsenicum

251
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:34,250
and after that my thirst was increased but I’m not quite sure.

252
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:38,500
The last couple of years I’ve been drinking much more than I did before.

253
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:52,010
I never drink much before and I drink during the night. I have to have a glass of water.

254
00:35:54,270 --> 00:36:01,010
-How many times you wake up now for urination during night?

255
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:15,170
-While I’m here I’m not drinking so much, hardly at all. 3,4,6.

256
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:29,770
-But yes you are not sleeping, you get up from 2-6 times?

257
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:33,340
-Yes, 3-4 times.

258
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:48,600
-You want to do things, you are still in a hurry, this hurried feeling is less now?

259
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,080
-No, I think it’s still there.

260
00:36:53,180 --> 00:37:01,010
-It’s still there but it’s less or it’s the same?
-It’s a little bit less than after I took Ignatia.

261
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:10,340
In the beginning of Ignatia this hurriedness was very strong.

262
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:24,080
-But before Ignatia you have said, you had this hurried feeling which we had underlined 3 times

263
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:33,180
before Ignatia. Now how it is?
-I think it’s better.

264
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:43,320
When this religious despair and this animal thing and these emotional things got better,

265
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,280
this hurriedness also got better.

266
00:37:54,750 --> 00:38:14,580
-Desire for sweets, how much, how strong?
-I would put 3.

267
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,580
-That means you prefer to eat sweets than food.

268
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:29,660
-If I’m hungry it’s faster. If I’m very hungry it’s very fast, I eat something sweet.

269
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,000
-Yes but it’s different. Give me an idea how many sweets you take every day.

270
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:50,260
-I can easily eat the whole chocolate and I put lots of sugar in the tea.

271
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:54,090
-How much?
-4-5 or 6 spoons.

272
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:06,920
-And you say you have an aggravation from sugar and you take all this sugar.

273
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,490
Are you sure you take all this sugar?

274
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,070
-I try not to do every day but…

275
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:21,310
-How many times you will have a tea in a day? A tea with 4-5 spoons?

276
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:29,900
-2 times but I have an aggravation from tea so I try not to drink tea,

277
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
so I’ve been eating less sugar lately.

278
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:41,080
-But that’s what I’m asking and you say you eat so much. What is the less?

279
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:48,070
-I have a problem with my memory, it’s very confused.

280
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:51,570
-It’s OK but you can remember today did you eat sugar, yes or no?

281
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:56,260
-Today I had 2 cups of tea with a lot of sugar.

282
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:05,070
-So you take a lot of sugar. But in spite of taking so much sugar,

283
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:10,730
you don’t have so much the aggravation from sugar, it seems to me.

284
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:22,170
-A little less I think but the digestive problems are still there from sugar.

285
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:33,070
I feel a lot of fermentation and distention, bloatedness from sugar.

286
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:39,260
-From sugar alone, not from other food?
-Yes, from most food.

287
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,260
-Why don’t you say so far?

288
00:40:53,250 --> 00:41:06,660
You have this bloatedness in a particular time or it can be morning, afternoon, evening?

289
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,100
-No, it’s not a particular time.

290
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:16,320
-It can be any time and there are some other times when you don’t have the bloatedness.

291
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:19,240
-No, it’s always there.

292
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:25,170
-Do you have a lot of gas?
-It’s better but it’s still there.

293
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:31,090
-Eructations?
-I had a lot before but these are also better.

294
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:40,000
-Did you ever take Calcarea carbonica before?

295
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:50,430
-Yes one time and I slept better and this wearing socks and clammy feet was much better.

296
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,750
-When did you take Calc carb, do you remember?

297
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,930
-About 3 years ago.

298
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:08,850
-What was the potency?
-200 I think.

299
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:28,000
After Medorrhinum I had some stitching pains in my heart that I had before

300
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,410
but it comes and goes.

301
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:38,240
-Did you get any acute during that period, any cold, bronchitis?

302
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,770
-No.

303
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:49,750
-The tiredness at this moment, let us say when you are here, you are not sleeping

304
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:58,830
how much it is? It’s strong tiredness or in spite of the fact that you don’t sleep

305
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:06,020
the tiredness in not so excessive?
-No, the tiredness is not better.

306
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:13,490
-When you sleep do you perspire during sleep?
-Sometimes.

307
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:18,760
-Where?
-On the back.

308
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:27,600
-Head?
-Not so much. It’s more like a flush of heat.

309
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:34,020
-Do you turn left, right?
-I can not sleep on the left side.

310
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,850
-Why?
-Palpitation in the heart immediately.

311
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:57,190
But I think I feel much more tense after Medorrhinum I think.

312
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,090
-Inner tension?

313
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:08,670
-Inner tension and also the whole body feels much more stiff.

314
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:11,950
-Tensing means stiff or cramped?

315
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:26,050
-Stiff or cramped, I can not relax but after the dreams somehow I felt a kind of freedom.

316
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:40,200
-Did you analyze your dreams or did you think about your dreams?

317
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:49,210
-Yes, I did a lot because it was so strong so I could hardly let go.

318
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:07,780
-Did you connect them with this abuse that you had as a child?

319
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,140
-Yes.

320
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,530
How is she doing?

321
00:45:46,280 --> 00:46:01,180
Do you remember why she came to be treated and how she tried to remember to say something

322
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:07,860
but the confusion, I was terrified with the confusion.

323
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:14,700
If we play back the case for those who remember, we will see a tremendous

324
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,780
confusion on mental level.

325
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:26,320
This was the main thing and where the prescription was targeting, on the mental confusion

326
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,420
and tremendous mental weakness.

327
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:37,260
Do we have the same mental weakness or now we have a physical weakness?

328
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,320
More she complains about physical weakness.

329
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:49,240
She responded immediately, she gave clear answers. Only 1 time she said, I can’t remember

330
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,740
but it was not.

331
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:56,820
For me that I know a little bit more I don’t want to say but this is another reason why she said,

332
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,320
I don’t remember, it doesn’t matter but she said it only once.

333
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,510
In the beginning she kept on saying, I don’t remember, I don’t remember.

334
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,740
-Even her eyes look very different from last time.

335
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,320
Last time she was a little bit in a hurry and she didn’t know where to look

336
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,670
and now she was communicating.

337
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:32,330
-So what we should perceive is the confusion and the lack of energy on the mental level

338
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:41,070
going away and of course we have some work to do with her. The lack of energy

339
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:47,730
is still on the physical level with her, quite a lot but together with this change,

340
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:59,590
what else is important that came up? What made an impression for you?

341
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:11,660
She starts to remember and she starts to remember through dreams, that means something

342
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,090
which is very deep in the subconscious is coming up.

343
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:22,240
And of course by coming up there are some fears which develop but the fears now

344
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:34,760
are real fears, a dog, heights.

345
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:53,760
The case is unfolding, it goes towards the right direction.

346
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:19,040
This was a complete mental case and now we can say it is mostly physical.

347
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:25,960
What she complains mostly is this chronic fatigue.

348
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:32,460
I’d like to discuss with you is why still she does not sleep.

349
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:38,210
-She said she does not sleep but she is frightened to dream.

350
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:51,360
-That’s her explanation. Is this full explanation?

351
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,460
-No.

352
00:49:53,960 --> 00:50:02,950
-She is afraid of remembering, it’s a kind of protective mechanism of the body or the organism

353
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:10,290
and I have a question. Some day with the correct remedy, she will be able to remember

354
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:16,380
and will she then be in such a state that she will also deal with whatever she remembers?

355
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:36,790
-Yes. Because we don’t manipulate. We let the organism unfold by the help of health in general.

356
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:47,040
Therefore when she is ready to face the facts and deal with the facts, she will do it,

357
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,530
without any repercussion.

358
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:59,620
If you force here, by a kind of force, by psychoanalysis she may have a repercussion,

359
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:08,950
she will modify the issues but if you let her by herself and with the right remedy,

360
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:14,940
absolutely she will come to the point where she will remember she will face

361
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,540
and she will find a real solution.

362
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:30,030
I agree also with you that this is a protective mechanism. She is terrified to remember

363
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:37,700
what took place in her young age and therefore the dream is the first subconscious,

364
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:46,700
it’s the first level which pushes to the conscious mind some information, which relates to that.

365
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:54,200
I asked her, does it relate? She says, yes it’s related. Now if it’s related and it’s so vivid

366
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:59,210
she will have to face it, she is not ready, why? She is not strong enough.

367
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:05,130
Why she is not strong enough? We gave the wrong remedy?

368
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,210
-It takes time.

369
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:17,310
-What shall we do then now? You want to give Nitric acid.

370
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:23,700
In order to give Nitric acid you have to have some keynotes of Nitric acid.

371
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,640
What are the keynotes for Nit acid in this case?

372
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:34,730
Anxiety about health is one main point for Nit acid, we don’t see it here.

373
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:47,970
The urine which smells very heavily like horse, the brittle nails, the cracks,

374
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:54,300
wherever they may be, the distorted nails.

375
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:06,970
Stramonium with this case? You have fears, first of all the fears are strong fears,

376
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:12,700
secondly the main fear for Stramonium is missing. Which is the main fear for Stram.?

377
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,630
-Dark.

378
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:21,650
-Fear of the dark without which the other fears forget it.

379
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:30,790
Fears are coming and you are missing the main fear, forget it and the fear of dogs,

380
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:35,130
she says, big dogs. It’s not a big fear.

381
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:43,520
Stramonium has big fear and then fear of high places, where is Stramonium and then

382
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:47,370
and then and the rest is not important.

383
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:57,040
Don’t take little things like a wart here and there or some little itching or a pressure.

384
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:03,970
A pressure in the head with hot head and cold feet is Belladonna, it’s not Stramonium.

385
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:11,710
Why not Belladonna. Stramonium is too violent for her in any case.

386
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:21,210
So you will see what it is. Show the repertorization.

387
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:45,960
The flow stops when lying down, yes it is characteristic, she had it also

388
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:53,040
but this is not enough, the hurried also feeling is there.

389
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,370
You have 2 symptoms of Lilium Tigrinum.

390
00:54:56,470 --> 00:55:02,450
How many symptoms of Lilium tigrinum you found there? Let’s see.

391
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:07,040
How many of the symptoms are with Lilium tigrinum?

392
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:19,720
Lil tigr has desire for sweets but Lil tig is on first degree.

393
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:35,700
She insisted and she persuaded us it’s on the third degree. In haste yes, religious despair yes,

394
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:48,700
sleeplessness is not a very big thing …open air ameliorates, perspiration on feet,

395
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,310
perspiration clammy, weakness.

396
00:55:53,830 --> 00:56:02,970
It’s not a big remedy for weakness. The remedy is Calcarea carbonica.

397
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:12,620
She will take a dose of Calcarea carbonica, next time we will see what will be the effect.

398
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:24,380
There was no symptom against Calc carb.

399
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:32,450
On the contrary there were a lot of symptoms in favor of Calc carb and keynote symptoms as well,

400
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:39,790
so you can not ignore this fact and go for another remedy.

401
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:47,780
Lil tigr is a very good prescription, Helonias also if you read especially when she says

402
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:56,620
with the least movement I have perspiration, Helonias is a remedy for chronic fatigue syndrome

403
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:08,870
with perspiration on moving but if you are in despair you give Helonias or you give Lil tigr

404
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:14,460
but here we are not yet in despair. We have the picture of Calc carb

405
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:19,230
and quite fully I would say now.

406
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:30,880
The effect of Calc carb is going to be much more different than it was when she was having this,

407
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:39,340
this and that remedy. She had taken 59 remedies before, between them Calc carb

408
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:40,390
and everything else.

409
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,200
-Which potency?

410
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,560
-Which potency?

411
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:04,390
She can go quite high, no problem, 1M.
