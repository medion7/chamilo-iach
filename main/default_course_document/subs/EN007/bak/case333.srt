1
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:34,090
-I am treated by Homeopathy since 1984 and I got the same remedy Carcinosin every two months

2
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,020
in 2 years in average.

3
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:44,010
In 1983 we were in England for 1 year, in Oxford and then I was very exhausted,

4
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:50,110
I had severe insomnia.

5
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:58,180
We were coming for 1 year with 4 little children and I couldn’t sleep for 3 months.

6
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:08,940
I had 2-3 hours at night and I went to a homeopath and she prescribed me Sepia 200C

7
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,770
and that really didn’t do anything.

8
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,260
In December I had a fracture in my fibula and I was hospitalized for 1 week

9
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,620
and after that operation I slept very well.

10
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:45,680
In that year 1993 in May I got Phosphorus 200C and by that I felt something, more than before.

11
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,010
-From Sepia and Carcinosin you felt no change?

12
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:56,020
-Carcinosin I got many times before and I didn’t feel anything.

13
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:04,670
I had (?) who were very, very difficult, I’ll come to this later but I felt no effect.

14
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,520
I came here because I want a change.

15
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,180
Actually I never had initial aggravation after taking a remedy;

16
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:32,090
only after the Phosphorus I had skin eruption that is still there in my back.

17
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:40,090
It is covered like mushroom and this is the only thing that happened.

18
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,630
But I felt better after Phosphorus.

19
00:02:43,730 --> 00:03:01,600
Then 2 years ago, I had again symptoms that I had years before, fear for my son.

20
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,850
He got for the first time his letter from the army to go. This is my oldest son.

21
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:10,440
He is now 18.

22
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:20,850
I felt a lot of anxiety around this issue and again insomnia, I was also constipated

23
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:28,600
and I got again Carcinosin 1M and for the first time

24
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:38,300
the symptoms really disappeared quite immediately and I felt different for the first time.

25
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,240
-When did you receive Carcinosin 1M?

26
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:57,160
-2 years ago and that took away those symptoms of great fear from cancer

27
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,490
and especially fear for my child.

28
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,840
-You have fear of cancer?
-Not so much now.

29
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:17,740
But I used to have that. I got the Carcinosin before because my homeopath was very touched

30
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,980
from my circumstances that both of my parents died when they were 50 years old from cancer.

31
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,580
-Both parents died at the age of 50?
-My father was 51, my mother was 50.

32
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,740
-And how old you are?
-I’m 44.

33
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:47,730
My father died 20 years ago and my mother died 15 years ago and usually I can still cry

34
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,570
when I talk about that.

35
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:55,390
-You were born in Israel or in America?
-I was born in Jerusalem.

36
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:02,310
My parents were holocaust survivors, they were very young then.

37
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:14,160
In the war my mother was 11 and my father was 16 and they came to Israel after the war from Hungary.

38
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:27,300
We didn’t hear at home much about the war, nothing. Nothing was talked about the war

39
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,730
but my father especially was very reserved and had tremendous grief.

40
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:43,400
He expressed that in doing philosophy. He was philosopher.

41
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:51,050
My mother was very active and dynamic and she did a lot, she was very bright intellectual.

42
00:05:51,150 --> 00:06:01,400
They wanted to have a new family, a new future. They had 5 children.

43
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,620
-They came to Israel after the war.

44
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,340
-You loved your father?
-Yes.

45
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,840
-Very much?
-Indeed.

46
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:28,690
-And your mother?
-I had special relationship with my mother.

47
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:44,330
But much more normal relationship, I could fight, I could get angry. I could challenge her.

48
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,580
-But my father was a figure …

49
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,160
-He was a figure you admired or you loved at the same time or mostly admire?

50
00:06:53,260 --> 00:07:02,410
-No. I really, really loved him. And I could feel him very much.

51
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:09,310
-You could feel his pain, you are hurt of how he died?

52
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:18,500
-Yes my parents died with us, at home. I wasn’t with my father’s death.

53
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:26,170
He was invited to Switzerland to give lectures; he was then very ill, my mother was sure

54
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:39,850
that she could fight with god. She was determined that he will live and he will get over his illness,

55
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:46,010
he was in the last stages of colon cancer then but he accepted the invitation

56
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,090
and he was lecturing in (?) until a week before his death.

57
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:59,520
By that time I stayed in Israel with my little brother and I didn’t see him in his last 6 weeks.

58
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,150
-What is your main problem at this moment?

59
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:19,160
-My main problem is that I would like to shift, I’m too much emotional.

60
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:27,420
-You think?
-Yes I feel a lot of emotions.

61
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:35,000
-You belong to a religious group which is very strict.
-No we’re not very strict.

62
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,910
-Can you tell me?
-You want me to describe you?

63
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:45,910
-Yes.
-We don’t really belong.

64
00:08:46,010 --> 00:09:01,320
We are (?) to find our own way in doing tradition of Judaism and creating our own way.

65
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:12,910
-Do you feel restricted at all by religion?
-No.

66
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,900
-On the contrary?

67
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:26,170
-On the contrary, it’s a feeling for values from history that I shift to next generation

68
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,180
with a lot of learning.

69
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,900
-So what is the problem with a lot of emotions. I don’t see a problem.

70
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,500
Everybody likes a lot of emotions, why you want to have less emotions?

71
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:52,910
-I can cry easily, I can sit with patients and I need to hold myself.

72
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,900
-Not to cry?

73
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,740
-Not so much in those situations, in my clinic I’m more settled

74
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:09,350
but I’m too much moved too much impulsive.

75
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,090
-Where did you learn English?
-Basically in Israel.

76
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:25,000
-You understand the meaning of the word impulsive? Impulsive is somebody

77
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:32,250
who can not hold back his opinion because his emotions are strong and he goes into fights,

78
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:42,990
he goes into stating opinions very easily, even if it a strong opinion, even if it’s going to hurt others.

79
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:52,740
That’s impulsive. If somebody is full of love and affection and you express this love

80
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:58,740
and affection, you are not impulsive. I want you to understand what you are telling me

81
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,410
because this is what I understand by impulsive.

82
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:10,240
Maybe you have another idea of what impulsive is. What is impulsive for you?

83
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:19,990
-No, I’m like I said before. I would like to shift some of here, here and not to be so emotional.

84
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,850
-Not to cry so easily.
-For example yes.

85
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,160
-Can you describe a little bit more what is the problem?

86
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,070
When you say to me I want to move some emotions into my head,

87
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,650
so you have control of emotions I believe,

88
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,260
you mean you want to have more control of your emotions?

89
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:05,370
But can you tell me what kind of emotions you have, can you describe your emotions?

90
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:12,670
-I didn’t mean it’s negative, I meant it’s over whelming.

91
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:28,320
-But they are positive mostly or it is fear?
-Not fear, it contains a lot of sympathetic.

92
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,740
-You are very sympathetic?
-Yes.

93
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:38,900
-If somebody is suffering? Like if you observe the cases here, you sometimes cry?

94
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:47,150
-Most of the time I cry, I read books I cry, I go to films I cry, yes.

95
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,130
-But do you cry especially when you see pain to others?

96
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,440
-Yes.

97
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:03,830
-Do you sometimes feel the pain yourself? The pain which somebody is describing?

98
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,830
-No.

99
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,070
-You have children?
–Yes.

100
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,330
-How many?
-4.

101
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:19,080
-If one of your children is sick, you can handle it or you become out of your mind from anxiety

102
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,880
and what is going to happen?

103
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:36,660
-I’m not frightened when they get sick but I do have special problem with my older son.

104
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:48,010
With him I can get very, very anxious if he is not well or now if he is going to the army.

105
00:13:49,010 --> 00:14:05,660
When he was 2 years old, I put him on a swing, with his brother a baby and he fell off

106
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:14,150
it was in the house of my parents and he had a very severe concussion

107
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:22,420
and he was in coma for 30 hours.

108
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,650
-And you got a big fright.

109
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:39,980
-I was in a big shock, it was a trauma for me and this period that my mother was very ill

110
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,110
and I was a lot with her and this was in her place when it happened,

111
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:50,610
my husband was in the army and I was with the two babies in the hospital

112
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:56,970
and none really said that he will be alive.

113
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,860
-You were living in a kibbutz by that time?

114
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:06,870
-No, I’m from Jerusalem and my parents used to live in another city.

115
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:17,290
So this was a fighting situation for me and things became so intensive;

116
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:27,860
my mother died after a year and I was with her a lot, I was with her in the room when she died

117
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:36,720
and since then it was very intensive and I didn’t think much of the pain of my son.

118
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:46,120
When my mother died I had two other children with me, I was 27 and I had 2 babies

119
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,610
and 2 teenagers in my house.

120
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,890
-Too much responsibility?

121
00:15:51,990 --> 00:16:03,860
-And a lot of care and attention to the war, it was very living situation that I had to take care.

122
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:13,200
So when my son got this letter from the army, I had again these pictures coming back.

123
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,350
-These pictures of what?

124
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:21,470
-Of his sight in the hospital that he was in total coma.

125
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:32,350
-You are still affected by this incident. I see you want to cry when you describe it.

126
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:44,600
-Yes, very much because with him all the years in the beginning I was very sensitive.

127
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:52,270
He was the first grand child in my family, he got too much care from my family

128
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,520
and he developed an (?) I didn’t know anything about alternative medicine when it happened

129
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,020
and my brother is a doctor and he took too much care of him

130
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:15,770
and he had a lot of attention in the hospital. He had some incidents and his (?) was taken out

131
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,770
and after my mother’s death he didn’t hear it. When my mother died he didn’t hear anything.

132
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:29,270
He had total absence of hearing after several hearing infections

133
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:37,580
and it was very very intensive and when he was 4 years old, we started with homeopathic treatment

134
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:44,830
and it became a little better but it’s still until now very sensitive.

135
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:49,480
When he says, he doesn’t feel well I get very anxious.

136
00:17:50,990 --> 00:18:01,980
And I feel that my thoughts or if I feel negative for him, that can affect him.

137
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:14,390
So I have this struggle inside to meditate and to be positive and to give him confidence

138
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:20,240
and he feels this very, very strong.

139
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:27,630
-He feels the connection?
-He feels my fears and that I don’t support him.

140
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,620
In the army he wanted to go to a very dangerous unit and he didn’t get support from me so much,

141
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,870
I was quite neutral.

142
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:44,040
So it wasn’t good for him, he was now accepted to the Navy, to one of the units that he

143
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:54,140
is going to be 5 years in the army and I try to be very positive. I don’t like army.

144
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:08,290
-How is your energy?
-Very good.

145
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,650
-You have a lot of energy?
-Too much sometimes.

146
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:25,060
-She is sighing.
-Yes but I never sigh.

147
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:37,130
-You are pressurized now. Is difficult for you to speak about yourself or no?

148
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,530
Or here is difficult?
-I took some rescue remedy actually.

149
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:48,950
I was (?) with the child, I had fear to speak in front of people.

150
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:54,710
In my class I could be totally paralyzed or feeling trembling of heart beating

151
00:19:54,810 --> 00:20:00,470
and in high school I had times that it changed just to the opposite.

152
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:08,210
I was very challenged in that age, I was very energetic and leader,

153
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:13,460
a kind of an (?) speaking in front of many people and that was my job in the army too.

154
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:23,070
Performing, not artistic but lecturing.

155
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,870
-What was the subject on which you lectured?

156
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:35,210
-It was a very small unit that trained the people to go with the soldiers

157
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:44,950
and explain them about geology, archaeology, botanical sights where they go and see.

158
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:53,790
So I could join various units of the army and go with them and then in the break times

159
00:20:53,890 --> 00:21:00,790
I explained them or had to give lectures in some of the basis, all over the country

160
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:06,550
with a lot of seminars, it was very interesting. And I did it very well.

161
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,560
-You did it very well but you were always afraid?

162
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:16,720
-I was very anxious before. I always prepared it very well and no,

163
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:25,720
that time I wasn’t so anxious actually. I did it without that. In the University it came again,

164
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:33,570
this impossible to talk in front of people, a timidity.

165
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,450
It’s one of the reasons I didn’t complete my (?) in the University.

166
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,800
-What did you study in the University?

167
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:54,790
-History, archaeology and geography. And I didn’t finish my Master Degree

168
00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:03,890
because I had to be in front of many Professors, the big exam and I just felt I couldn’t do that.

169
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:16,470
-Have you ever taken Lycopodium?
-No.

170
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,900
-Silica?
-No.

171
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,880
-Are you constipated at all?
-Not anymore.

172
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:36,970
-You like to eat something very much? Salt, sweets.

173
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,100
-I have aversion to fats, I can not tolerate that.

174
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,390
-It gives you a pain?
-Not a pain, a sensation of not comfortable.

175
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,270
I will never eat something that was fried.

176
00:22:52,370 --> 00:23:01,520
-Aversion to fat or worse from fat? You can eat it but then you will the pain?

177
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:09,770
-I’m vegetarian since age 17. Only the last 2 years I eat some chicken from time to time.

178
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:14,870
I don’t like meat and I don’t like fats.

179
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:23,280
-You don’t like meat really or because you are vegetarian and you belong to this group?

180
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:29,110
-It started like this but now I don’t like it.

181
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:37,440
I liked it before, when I stopped it was an ideological thing but now I wouldn’t like to eat.

182
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:42,020
I don’t have that theory right now.

183
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,560
-But the desire has gone. Milk you take?

184
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:53,780
-Milk no. I like cheese or yogurt very much.

185
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:05,790
-What else you don’t like? How much salt you take?
-Normal, not too much.

186
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,630
-Fish?
-I like fish.

187
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:17,610
-You take fish and you like it.
-I like it, I don’t have craving.

188
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:22,370
-Eggs?
-I like eggs.

189
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:30,470
-Very much?
-More than before.

190
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:37,120
-What form? Hard boiled, soft boiled, fried?

191
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:48,710
-Not fried. I don’t like fried. But I can have it boiled or soft.

192
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,080
-Do you feel cold or hot? Your feet are cold?

193
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:05,600
-I used to be cold person 10 years ago and I became more and more hot.

194
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,680
-Now you are bothered by heat?

195
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:33,830
-If it’s closed and stuffed I will suffer very much. If it’s hot outside, I don’t bother.

196
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:40,670
I like to be outside. If the room is closed, it can be horrible.

197
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,490
-You had any serious disease in your life?

198
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:29,260
-I used to have (?) infections when I was a child, tonsillitis but not too often.

199
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,410
-Ear problem?

200
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:43,570
-No. I got injections for rabies when I was in the army.

201
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,750
-Why?

202
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:52,750
-Because I was near the Jordanian border in the night and some dogs were running after me

203
00:26:52,850 --> 00:27:04,160
and bitten me a little bit but that area is known to have rabies.

204
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,240
-When it was that?

205
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:20,100
-1973. I got 15 injections in my stomach and actually I enjoyed it.

206
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,090
-Are you claustrophobic at all?
-Not at all.

207
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,250
-You swim in the sea or you never swim?

208
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,490
-I don’t like so much to swim in the sea.

209
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,810
-Why?

210
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:52,160
-In my childhood I’ve almost drowned. Since then I like the sea but not inside.

211
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,920
I swim but I’m not crazy and I don’t like cold water.

212
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:01,710
Here I was swimming twice when I came here but it was too cold.

213
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:10,820
-But if you hear running water, a tap, you have the urgency to go for urination?

214
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,680
-No.

215
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,830
-You understand what I ask?

216
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:21,950
-I understand but I don’t have any symptoms of (?). No, really no.

217
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,570
-How do you know?

218
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:29,580
-I read the proving and I read a lot about this remedy

219
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,930
because I was concerned from this treatment.

220
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:42,930
-How old you were?
-I was 19.

221
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:53,100
-Since that time it has changed anything? You became more open or closed?

222
00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:02,160
-I really didn’t feel bad. That year I was alone in the country,

223
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:07,620
my parents had (?) year and I had to take the decision myself.

224
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,580
The Israeli doctors didn’t want to do it.

225
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:17,320
They were not sure about that and I was going to consult with doctors.

226
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:25,080
It was one week of not knowing what to do. They took a week.

227
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:31,580
-Before they decide and then you pushed them to make a decision?

228
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:42,830
-I didn’t know anything about that and they were so scared and no one from my family was there

229
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:49,070
and I did this consultation and I decided that maybe I will live less

230
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:52,920
but maybe I will die in one week.

231
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:58,740
-You didn’t like to die in one week.
-I didn’t like the idea of one week.

232
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,350
-Now? You are afraid of death?

233
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:17,060
-I had a lot of fear for death, especially for 10 years after my parents died but now it has changed.

234
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,980
-To what? To another fear or to less fear?

235
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:31,150
-To less fear, I’m not so concerned with this. I’m more afraid for my children.

236
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:39,640
-Your anxiety is because of your children now. About your husband?

237
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:46,750
-Not about my husband, not about my 3 children so much as my older one.

238
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:56,150
-This anxiety is what? You are suffering at this moment mostly or there are fears?

239
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,910
You are afraid of dark, thunderstorms?

240
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:19,070
-I’m not afraid of dark, to go alone in the forest in the dark I wouldn’t do that

241
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:23,030
but I’m not afraid of dark.

242
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,830
-Thunderstorms?
-No.

243
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:38,730
-Your nails are breaking easily? You bite them?

244
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:48,830
-No I’m not biting them. They are not strong but are not easily breaking.

245
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:09,350
-Do you have any other fear? Fear of high places, fear of talking to people, fear of dogs?

246
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:23,930
-No, I’m not afraid of dogs. I do have this fear of talking in front of people.

247
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:33,670
If it’s a small group or intimate place I’m not fearing but if it’s a big group, yes.

248
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:40,170
Even in the University when it was a big class, I could be very frightful

249
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:49,250
or now we went to the USA and I had to give a little talk, I was completely…

250
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,260
-Paralyzed?

251
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:59,250
-Not paralyzed but I was feeling my heart beating and it’s ridiculous.

252
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:04,090
-It is ridiculous? You have a good rapport with your husband?

253
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:14,680
-Very good. I’m staying here now a month and it’s difficult to be away from him.

254
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:19,330
-Do you talk to him on the telephone?
-Every day.

255
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:31,080
-That’s nice. About your thirst can you tell me? Thirsty, not thirsty, cold water, hot water?

256
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:40,330
-I’m not drinking cold, I don’t like to drink cold. I drink mostly warm or room temperature.

257
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:45,940
If it’s hot, I can drink cold but never icy cold.

258
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:55,100
My thirst is changing. I was thirst less I didn’t drink. I pushed myself to drink.

259
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,760
Now I’m drinking more but I can also not drink.

260
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,080
-Your sleep is good now?
-Yes.

261
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,040
-You wake up refreshed?

262
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:14,190
-I wake up easily in the morning, yes.

263
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:22,910
-And you have a lot of energy? To study it is easy for you or it is difficult?

264
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:32,180
-My memory is not what it used to be. I don’t remember so well and I have sometimes

265
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:41,250
that if I’m caught in my thoughts, persistent thoughts, it can drive me out of my studies

266
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:54,770
and I can be not there. I need to focus more but I like to study. And I work a lot.

267
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:02,410
-Do you have what they call daydreaming?
-No.

268
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:10,840
-Do you see dreams and you remember them?

269
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:16,580
-I remember some of my dreams but I don’t remember much.

270
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:24,000
-Do you have a theme? Your dreams do they have a theme, like swimming or flying

271
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:29,590
or somebody is pursuing you or you are falling?

272
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:46,340
-The dream I really remember but it didn’t come more than that was that I was myself a wolf

273
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,520
and I was caring in my teeth my daughter.

274
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:11,920
And when I woke up, I still felt I am a wolf. I had to release from this picture.

275
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,920
-It was only one time?

276
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:22,420
-It didn’t repeat. Maybe twice, but not more than that.

277
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,770
-How old is your daughter?
-10 and a half.

278
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,690
-Your daughter is challenging you?

279
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:02,840
-She is special character and she is very strong.

280
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,090
-She likes her father more than you?

281
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:18,580
-She has a lot from my husband. You mean if she looks like my husband?

282
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:24,440
-It’s a good way to answer.

283
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,650
-She is very connected to my husband.

284
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:32,250
-Very connected to your husband. They are very close.

285
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:43,160
-Do you think you are jealous?
-No, I’m really not at all.

286
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:49,730
-Do you have the feeling of jealousy? Do you know the feeling of jealousy?

287
00:37:49,830 --> 00:38:00,820
-I know the feeling, I know what you mean but it’s not part of me.

288
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:17,420
I don’t have (?) feeling of jealousy, I can not connect with this. It’s not me, jealousy.

289
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:35,920
But the dream of my daughter in my mouth had the impression with more of that I had to rescue her.

290
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:44,060
That was the impression of the dream. It was very dangerous.

291
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,320
-What was the danger? Do you remember?

292
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:59,410
-There was a river and we walked and I had that feeling of rescuing my children.

293
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:04,780
I don’t know what happened to the others but I could rescue her.

294
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:20,300
The others were not in the dream. That was 2 years ago. I don’t have many dreams.

295
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,870
Maybe it was after taking the remedy, the last remedy.

296
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:28,130
Because after I take remedies, I have dreams.

297
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,070
I remember them all.

298
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,120
-There is itching in your eruption?

299
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:56,630
-No, it’s not itching. When I said that I didn’t react to the remedies, I also meant

300
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:01,380
that I did not have fever.

301
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:14,800
Always after my body went through physical effort, then it’s when I developed fevers.

302
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:22,880
So I had one after delivery and another after the other delivery and the last one after my operation.

303
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:26,630
I had a high fever for 3 days.

304
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:30,440
-When it was the operation?
-1993.

305
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:42,070
-And after the operation you felt good for insomnia.
-I felt very good.

306
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,030
-How do you explain this?

307
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:54,270
-We were in England, it was a very interesting year and I had a lot.

308
00:40:54,370 --> 00:41:00,350
It wasn’t easy to come with 4 kids to a new place and I was very busy and with many guests

309
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:07,770
and then out of a sudden I could rest for one week at the hospital, in a nice room, read a lot

310
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:10,520
and not with other people.

311
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:20,790
It was an interesting experience and I had deep rest after a very intensive month.

312
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,690
-You mean you had a rest in the hospital?

313
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:35,300
-In the hospital and then afterwards, I was very spoiled I couldn’t move for weeks from bed.

314
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:42,200
-So you recovered. You were exhausting yourself before?

315
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,930
-Yes and I got a lot of affection from people.

316
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:53,200
-You like attention?
-I do like attention.

317
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:13,600
-Your husband is jealous of you? He has fears that sometimes I will abandon him.

318
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:20,210
-He tells you these fears?
-Yes.

319
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:26,200
-But you don’t have fears that he may leave you.
-No.

320
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:36,100
-In this religious group, you belong since childhood or it was a decision later on?

321
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,860
-It’s from home.

322
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:49,500
My grand parents were very religious and my parents became more independent in this way,

323
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:55,910
my father was philosopher and he was academic and they were challenging this,

324
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:03,670
they were asking a lot of question, especially after the war and his writing is about that.

325
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:09,910
So I came from a very open house whilst my parents and other parts of the family

326
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:27,840
are deeply religious. I remember myself since age 14 looking for spiritual growth and learning,

327
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:33,440
it was not connected to my parents. They didn’t like it.

328
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:46,410
-So in your religion for instance you are allowed to have a boyfriend before you marry?

329
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:53,670
-From the group I come from, today is changing. Everything became more extreme

330
00:43:53,770 --> 00:44:00,920
but we belong to group which is allowed. Yes I had a boyfriend.

331
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,920
-You had before your marriage?
-Yes.

332
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:14,090
-Are you hurt by any of them?
-I did not have sexual intercourse.

333
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:23,070
-That was forbidden.
-Yes but I was with boys and we were together.

334
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:28,820
-But sexually you were aroused or no sexual place?

335
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:36,070
-Yes I had this desire but the (?)

336
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:51,160
-Were you hurt by any of these?
-Yes very much. My first boyfriend left me.

337
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:56,060
-Because he made another affair with a friend of yours?

338
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,560
-Not a friend of mine but there was 1973 war and the was in the army then

339
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:08,320
and they were many miles away from us and he knew another girl in that base.

340
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:18,920
He was in the country for 7 months and then he knew another girl and I was hurt.

341
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:34,560
-What did you do? How you reacted? Did you close yourself in a room and cried,

342
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,320
you did not cry, you decided to say?

343
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:43,010
-I cried, I wrote a lot of poems.

344
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:48,160
-Did you write letters to him?
-No.

345
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,330
-You were too proud?
-No.

346
00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:57,850
First it was not any connection, he was away in Egypt for many months

347
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:04,070
and actually I didn’t hear from him. The letter from him I got afterwards.

348
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:12,660
I was proud of course, I didn’t have any communication with him afterwards.

349
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,400
-He wrote a letter saying that I have met another girl and that’s it.

350
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,910
-Yes.

351
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:23,150
-Then you took the letter and you did not cried?

352
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:31,650
-I cried a lot. That’s what I said. I didn’t close myself. I could talk about this.

353
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,580
-With your friends or your mother?

354
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:51,660
-Yes, I could talk with her a little bit, they were not in the States. It was many years ago.

355
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,650
-You don’t remember.

356
00:46:53,750 --> 00:47:01,350
-I think I wasn’t so introverted. I had many friends.

357
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:07,410
-Another boyfriend hurt you?
-No I didn’t have that.

358
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:20,670
I had contacts with boys but I wasn’t hurt, maybe I hurt somebody.

359
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:39,570
I knew my husband in the University, we come back to my emotional states,

360
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:49,310
we fell in love and after one week we decided to get married. So it was very impulsive.

361
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,830
-That’s why you call yourself impulsive?

362
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:56,130
-In a way. I can make decisions very easily.

363
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,920
-You have no problem making decisions?
-No.

364
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,070
-You have problem looking from a high place, down?

365
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:12,170
-I can have problem looking from a high place, down.

366
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:21,810
-What problems? Vertigo or fear?
-No vertigo, uneasiness.

367
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:29,570
If I’m too close, not from high building but if it’s a cliff,

368
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:38,310
especially this situation is mostly with my children and I can get very agitated

369
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:41,800
if my child is there.

370
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:49,170
Then that is the worse thing and it’s happened to me.

371
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:56,320
-Did you ever use marihuana?
-No, never.

372
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:03,400
-It was not allowed in your religion? Nobody would know.

373
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:10,910
-I was offered several times when I was in a mission in America,

374
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:15,390
when I was 16 people wanted to give it to me. It never attracted me.

375
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:24,750
I was very strong in my opinions and my values.

376
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:34,400
Also in the army there were many situations that were very difficult for a woman many times.

377
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,250
-And you resisted everything?
-Oh yes.

378
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:45,830
-Army was before marriage?
-Exactly.

379
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:58,900
-Have you ever been in a condition where you have become very angry?

380
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:06,220
-Yes. In the past I was very angry and very nervous.

381
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:15,370
When I was a child 12,14 I could explode easily and even later and recently.

382
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:21,220
-Now you look very controlled.

383
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:29,130
-I’m not so. I don’t think I’m getting so angry now.

384
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:34,810
-If you do get angry, do you get very angry?

385
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:39,220
Do you remember sometimes when you got angry?

386
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,370
-You mean in the past?
-In the past and now.

387
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:48,880
-In the past I could be very angry and with my brothers and sisters we could fight.

388
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:57,720
-Yes but could you give me an example what was your biggest reaction when you were angry?

389
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:11,020
-It was most of the times more excitement during speech.

390
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:22,140
-Not throwing things?
-No. Maybe, when I was a child but not so much.

391
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:43,780
-How much salt you take?
-Not too much, the usual.

392
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:49,880
-Sweets?
-I like but not too much.

393
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,120
I can have a cake but not chocolate.

394
00:51:55,090 --> 00:52:04,440
-Do you support injustice? If some injustice is happening to you or to others,

395
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:11,040
is big deal for you?
-It can be a big deal.

396
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:20,100
-What you will do? You will interfere?

397
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:39,940
-When I was younger I could interfere. Not long ago we had in our country “Intifada”.

398
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:51,690
So I found myself going many times trying to release Palestinians

399
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:59,690
and going to the villages trying to convince the police to do things for them.

400
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:07,520
-Politically you were active pacifist?
-Not in a political way.

401
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:13,770
On a human instinct if I knew somebody I could fight for him.

402
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:31,540
Now I’m not political. My brother is but not me. My main effort is in my clinic.

403
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:34,790
Individual.

404
00:53:35,710 --> 00:53:40,700
-You like contact with patients?
-Yes, very much.

405
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:48,190
-You get some joy from this contact?
-Yes, very strong.

406
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:56,090
-I still don’t understand the problem.

407
00:53:56,190 --> 00:54:04,520
Why you want to be treated. You seem quite balanced healthy;

408
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:17,560
the only thing is you seem to be that you take long time to answer a question.

409
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:25,390
Why you do that? Because you think a lot before you can answer it correctly

410
00:54:25,490 --> 00:54:29,390
or because you don’t understand my question?

411
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:34,890
-I do understand the question; I need to answer more profound.

412
00:54:34,990 --> 00:54:41,140
-You need to think. So you are not impulsive. In your behavior here,

413
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:47,680
it is the opposite of impulsive.
-Yes.

414
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:54,230
-Why you said you are impulsive.
-I meant more emotional, not impulsive.

415
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:01,730
You see me here after a month of being in vacation in Greece.

416
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:17,130
If you would take my case a month ago, maybe things would be a bit different.

417
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:20,640
-Or a lot different?

418
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:33,140
-I can be very stressed and very tensed. I work very hard and I take too much care of my patients

419
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,890
and my children.

420
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:45,380
I felt a need for a remedy very much in July before I went to America for half a year

421
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:56,130
because I felt really inconfidence and this want of self-confidence was very, very strong then.

422
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:05,490
Since I came back to Israel my fear for my son got very, very, strong.

423
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:19,900
-Now you are here do you feel homesick?

424
00:56:20,430 --> 00:56:28,900
-It was very, very strong two weeks ago and this week I was crying a lot and I wanted to go back.

425
00:56:34,650 --> 00:56:39,400
It was too difficult to be away from my family for such a long period.

426
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:46,810
-You are here alone or with your husband?

427
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:55,130
-Not with my husband. He is with my children. It was very difficult and I cried a lot this week

428
00:56:55,230 --> 00:57:00,720
and I thought I will short this seminar and go back.

429
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:05,700
-But did you really feel homesick? Do you understand the word homesick?

430
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,650
-I understand and I don’t have this.

431
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:13,910
-You just miss your family.
-I miss my family very much.

432
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:16,970
-The affection?
-Yes.

433
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:45,970
-If you were to describe yourself what would you say? How you would describe yourself?

434
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:19,870
-It’s the most difficult thing. I’m very romantic, very idealistic and with a lot of emotions

435
00:58:19,970 --> 00:58:22,730
and a lot of care.

436
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:31,370
-A lot of love. You feel that you have a lot of love that you can give others?

437
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:36,980
-I do and sometimes it is overflowing.

438
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:44,540
-But this reaction from Phosphorus which you took, it was a good reaction.

439
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,800
Because the eruption is good when it comes out.

440
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,540
-I had a good reaction and I repeated the remedy.

441
00:58:50,640 --> 00:59:01,870
I was suffering a lot from yeast infection, itching in my vagina for long period

442
00:59:01,970 --> 00:59:09,220
and I repeated the remedy and it helped that very much.

443
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:19,380
I also took the remedy because I was very diffusive and everything was interesting from me.

444
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:28,380
I did a lot and studied there and here and after Phosphorus I was much more focused

445
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,130
and I could start my studies in Homeopathy.

446
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:39,900
Before, I did many, many things.

447
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,410
-But did you repeated Phosphorus?
-Yes in 1994 I took again 1M.

448
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:48,860
-And what happened? Again you felt good?

449
00:59:54,160 --> 01:00:01,820
-That period I worked in a hospital and I think without taking the Phosphorus I wouldn’t be able,

450
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:13,060
I had so many fears then for health. The Phosphorus really helped me in focusing

451
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:17,470
and being able to work with people with cancer.

452
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:23,960
But afterwards I stopped to work with people with cancer and I decided to keep distance.

453
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,710
-The fear of cancer was very strong?

454
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:35,710
-Very, very strong. After taking last time Carcinosin, it eased.

455
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:50,960
I had also fibrocystic breast and I had a cyst in my left breast.

456
01:00:55,820 --> 01:01:05,060
I only went to a surgeon from time to time to check it and after taking the Carcinosin it diminished.

457
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:29,890
-What kind of eruption is this?
-It’s all over my back.

458
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:37,390
-It’s like a fungus.
-Yes.

459
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:53,130
-Did you try again Phosphorus lately?
-No.

460
01:01:53,230 --> 01:02:03,120
-This anxiety about your son started immediately after seeing his papers to go to the army?

461
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:05,130
–Yes.

462
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:10,640
-And then you started think that something may happen or I have to think positive

463
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:16,470
otherwise I will influence him?
-Exactly.

464
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:21,630
-And then it has become a big thing for you this anxiety.

465
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:25,380
It has become really overwhelming.

466
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,630
-Yes and he had some problems this year.

467
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:35,630
He felt for a long time weakness and pains in his bones and he was very agitated from this

468
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:39,630
and he was very scared.

469
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:50,490
So I felt a lot his anxiety. But the Phosphorus did not bring me any other aggravation.

470
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:57,630
-If it brings out an eruption is good enough aggravation.

471
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:11,470
-Maybe I was affected that my homeopath said, you are not Phosphorus.

472
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:19,890
When I went back to my homeopath in Israel she prescribed me Carcinosin and not Phosphorus.

473
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:28,210
-But it doesn’t matter what anybody says, it matters what you say and how you feel.

474
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:34,710
If you feel good with Phosphorus, that means Phosphorus should be repeated.

475
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:42,640
And then if it does not act, then we’ll see what else can be done

476
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:50,380
but if Phosphorus has acted so well and now the anxiety about your child is overwhelming,

477
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,980
then most probably you have to repeat Phosphorus.

478
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:58,630
Pulsatilla is a possibility of course.

479
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:11,130
-That’s what it came out from my repertorization. But I prefer to…

480
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:14,130
-To hear my opinion? My opinion is you take first Phosphorus

481
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:19,470
and if it does not act then you take Pulsatilla.

482
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:21,310
OK?
-OK.
