1
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:39,190
I would like to read, it’s a woman 35 years old, first case, came with panic attacks,

2
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:46,540
fear of death, one sided numbness, perspiration, trembling, vertigo and dyspnea.

3
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,860
She also suffered from stomach ailments, gas, bloatedness from the abdomen after eating,

4
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,440
which was from 4 to 6 p.m. and pain in the right hypochondrium.

5
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,940
Lately she couldn’t travel in a crowded bus because of these panic attacks.

6
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,190
When I asked her how this began, she told that about six months ago she had been

7
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,440
in a car accident and although she had not been hurt physically,

8
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:29,190
these symptoms of panic attacks had started and have been occurring 3-4 times weekly.

9
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,940
As she was telling me all these things, she started weeping uncontrollably.

10
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,940
She told me that she was dissatisfied with her marriage and that her husband

11
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,440
had an extramarital affair.

12
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:50,290
She needed very much the support of the husband but he has been hard on her.

13
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,540
Generally worse from heat, desires open air, aversion fat.

14
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:18,840
Here there are three remedies, as I can see. You should be able to see three remedies.

15
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:29,510
One is a woman 35, panic attacks, with fear of death, one sided numbness, perspiration,

16
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,190
trembling, vertigo and dyspnea.

17
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:42,950
These symptoms point out to Aconite. Correct? We agree.

18
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,590
But we see also suffering from stomach ailments, gas, bloatedness, distention of abdomen

19
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:57,010
after eating, worse 4 to 6 p.m. and pain in the right hypochondrium.

20
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,360
These symptoms point to Lycopodium.

21
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,040
You did not know Lycopodium. Very good, it doesn’t matter.

22
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:28,210
Lately she couldn’t travel in a crowded bus because of these panic attacks.

23
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:36,140
For those who know both Aconite and Lycopodium, this symptom is common to both,

24
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,500
Aconite and Lycopodium.

25
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,890
But she had a car accident and after the car accident started the panic attacks.

26
00:03:47,800 --> 00:04:00,200
That means that after the car accident she started a symptomatology, which is

27
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,750
the recent symptomatology, which we have to take into consideration.

28
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:15,940
But further down in the report it writes that she started weeping all the time.

29
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:23,200
A remedy which is weeping all the time during consultation is Pulsatilla.

30
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,310
It’s another remedy, you don’t know, you’ve never heard.

31
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:35,900
So she cries, cries and she needed the support of the husband, but he is hard on her.

32
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,550
Pulsatilla is worse from heat, desires open air and has aversion to fat.

33
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:50,450
So since you did not know neither Lycopodium, nor Pulsatilla, the answer is Aconitum

34
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,550
and the answer is correct. Aconitum is the correct answer in this case.

35
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:08,380
So the majority of you, you got it but if you wrote Pulsatilla or Lycopodium,

36
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,690
you will get some marks.

37
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:21,840
Some of you may have thought of Pulsatilla or Lycopodium but Aconitum has to be

38
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:30,000
the first remedy because there is this fright and then the panic attacks which is typical

39
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,650
of Aconitum and you can not ignore this and go to a deeper remedy,

40
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,150
what we call a deeper remedy, which is Lycopodium or maybe Pulsatilla

41
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:48,000
because of this complaining with her husband and things like that.

42
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:56,420
With the information that you had so far, I give you this case.

43
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:03,070
Let us say you don’t know anything, you don’t know anything about Pulsatilla or Lycopodium

44
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:09,070
but Aconitum you know, so if you write Aconitum you get 10 marks,

45
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,400
you don’t need to write also Pulsatilla.

46
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:20,000
But if somebody knows already Pulsatilla, write Pulsatilla, we’ll give some marks.

47
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:28,250
-German marks?
-German marks yes, very valuable marks.

48
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:45,740
Before I go ahead, I wanted to read from the Medical Dictionary, Dorland’s Medical Dictionary.

49
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,740
What he says, because I see you did not know, apparent death.

50
00:06:49,840 --> 00:07:04,990
Apparent death - he says: a state of complete interruption of bodily processes from which

51
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:19,340
the patient can be resuscitated, resurrected. This is Dorland’s Medical Dictionary.

52
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:30,990
Apparent death is the right expression for “necrophania” which the Greek word is.

53
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:37,590
It appears to be dead, is the exact translation of “necrophania”.

54
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:48,990
Complete interruption, that means there is no breathing, there is no heart beating

55
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:55,240
and they can stay in that state for two or three days and can be resurrected

56
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,920
after three days.

57
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:05,010
This is a phenomenon which happens from time to time.

58
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,160
Yes.

59
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:18,660
-I have one question to the last case to Pulsatilla, when we give Pulsatilla now,

60
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:25,250
as the first remedy can it help her for tachycardia?

61
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,750
-You will not do anything. Pulsatilla in this case will do nothing.

62
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,850
-Only as a second remedy perhaps?

63
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:41,660
-Maybe as a second remedy and then maybe Lycopodium as a second remedy

64
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,190
and then third Pulsatilla or vice versa but you are not concerned with that.

65
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:55,190
What I am interested is whether by reading this case you are able to bring back

66
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,940
what you learned and connect with the case.

67
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,290
Does it sound like…

68
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:16,020
She is asking in out of the body experiences. The patient is out of his body

69
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:27,270
but still the body is functioning, whether this is an interruption

70
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,870
and where is the interruption?

71
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,540
Is that correct now? Yes.

72
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:51,690
As I pointed out with the slides, the disconnection can be a little bit, more, more, more

73
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:58,290
and it is in its highest in apparent death.

74
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:19,690
Now what happens is that the people who have seen that phenomenon they say that

75
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:26,070
there is a thread which connects the etheric body.

76
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:43,690
They describe, I’ve not seen it, which connects the etheric body, what we call the vital body,

77
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:57,690
with the physical body. So there is a kind of silver thread through which life passes through

78
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:03,690
and connects the vital body – that means the energy body which is there

79
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:10,280
and gives energy to the physical body. In death this is severed.

80
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,210
This is cut and this lives.

81
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:25,210
So in all cases where we have disconnection always there is a connection through a thread.

82
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:34,450
This is the explanation which is given by people who claim they have seen this connection.

83
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:39,950
What we are interested is not so much the mechanics, as the facts.

84
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:48,800
The fact is that I’m outside of my body, the body is lying there motionless and I can observe it.

85
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,830
This is a fact which nobody can deny.

86
00:11:53,050 --> 00:12:01,450
Also it’s a fact that when you sleep, somebody can even come and move you

87
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,550
and you will not wake up.

88
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,200
Some people sleep deep, they can have thunderstorms,

89
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:20,710
even canons and they are not aware. They are like dead.

90
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:34,630
And there is a state which is called “catalepsy” in which you try to enter back into your body

91
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:44,110
and you can not and you feel conscious and want to move your hands or feet and it’s not possible.

92
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:53,860
This is called cataleptic state. You have not been able to come back totally to your body.

93
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,610
So there is always a connection until the time of death.

94
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:08,110
Until the time of death the connection is severed and you are totally free

95
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:25,610
and it is very interesting that during these states usually the individual describes

96
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,880
very nice feelings.

97
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:42,780
The pain in the body is totally unaware and the feelings and the visions are very spiritual,

98
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:59,130
very uplifting. I had a case of an architect who opened the gas by mistake and he was gone.

99
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:10,950
They had gas in their house and he opened to make a bath and his mother saw that

100
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:16,200
he is not coming out, she knocked, broke the door, brought the ambulance

101
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,610
and he was able to observe everything that was happening.

102
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,860
How they took him out of the bath, how they put him in the ambulance,

103
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:33,150
how they put him in the hospital and then they pressurized his lungs to make his heart start.

104
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:42,300
He was so happy, he said why they are doing all that to me? I’m so well.

105
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:54,250
And this is not one time, it is again and again and again, so we cannot anymore

106
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,850
in Medicine ignore these facts.

107
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:10,270
If we are saying we are treating the human being, we have to take into consideration these facts,

108
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:16,100
though we do not understand the mechanics, how they work exactly.

109
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:26,770
How this disconnection is a thread which can be so long as coming from London to Athens,

110
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,850
it is unbelievable. What happens?

111
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:50,600
Or in that dimension we have other laws, in which time and space do not exist?

112
00:15:53,850 --> 00:16:01,550
Time and space do not exist because you think of going to America and you are in America.

113
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:13,420
There is no space actually, space is cancelled in this new dimension, in this dream state

114
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,170
where we know the dream.

115
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,270
You know how in your dream you change states, from one to the other.

116
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,170
But people who have experiences…

117
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:33,090
That means I have been related people who are here, they go to America, saw the problem

118
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:39,840
saw the child because the child is in America, had a problem and the mother went to America

119
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:45,590
and saw the whole situation, what happened to the child and she came back and

120
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:51,940
received a telephone call later on to say exactly what she has seen in her dream.

121
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:04,090
How things are we don’t know. What we are interested now here is that we are dealing on

122
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:13,940
this level. We are dealing on an energy level all the time by using homeopathic remedies.

123
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:21,840
So we have to be aware of what we are doing. Otherwise it will be totally blind,

124
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,850
take a remedy, throw it here, there, whatever.

125
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:34,140
We have to be absolutely clear, as much as possible, of what we are doing.

126
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:56,090
Then I believe later on Medicine will start changing and will take into consideration these facts.

127
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:18,160
Case 19. A woman age 50 complained that she had a pain located in her right shoulder.

128
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:26,160
Now for two months, her arm was almost ankylosed. She has been suffering with arthritis

129
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,260
for years and different other joints have been involved previously.

130
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,840
She was sighing all the time, during the interview and crying from time to time.

131
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:44,500
She also confided that a neighbor of hers passed away and she attended her funeral

132
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:51,990
and since this time, she feels strange, as if surrounded by her presence.

133
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,490
She was very anxious about her condition.

134
00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:00,240
As she had great anxiety about her health, kept on asking a lot of questions

135
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,590
concerning her condition and whether she will improve.

136
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,990
Desires salt, fat, worse cold, worse on waking in the morning.

137
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:21,090
And your answer was Calcarea carbonica, many of you.

138
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:43,460
Here actually I have kept a little bit of information back,

139
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:51,160
so I do not make it very easy for you, to see if you are perceptive.

140
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:56,790
Because if I had put all the information, everybody would write the remedy and it’s no good.

141
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,180
So you have to be perceptive. Is this a case of Calcarea carbonica?

142
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,930
Is this a case of Ignatia? Is this a case of Nitric acid, anxiety about health?

143
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,290
Is this a case of Calc. carbonica?

144
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:28,250
In order to have Calcarea carbonica you need some certain signposts.

145
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:41,980
If in this case it had been written that she is perspiring on her cervical region,

146
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,230
you are entitled to prescribe, with the addition of that symptom, Calcarea carbonica

147
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,580
because anxiety about health is there.

148
00:20:53,830 --> 00:21:05,980
If she said, no perspiration but the desire instead of salt and fat was for sweets and eggs,

149
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:15,480
you are entitled to write Calc. carbonica. But here you do not have enough symptoms to

150
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,830
prescribe Calc. carbonica.

151
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:31,820
You are not justified, I’m sorry but I feel that some they saw some others

152
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,910
writing Calcarea carbonica and they wrote Calcarea carbonica, no? In this particular case.

153
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,320
Because you did not know what to do, so you asked what do you write? Calcarea carbonica,

154
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:47,200
Calc. carbonica…

155
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:57,540
She is sighing all the time and it is underlined. Sighing all the time

156
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:08,460
and you think why not? Because a neighbor died, Ignatia.

157
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,210
Ignatia might be the remedy and you can write Ignatia

158
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:19,310
and you can get some marks but you will not get marks for Calcarea carbonica.

159
00:22:46,060 --> 00:23:01,560
Wait a moment. The idea is…

160
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,560
It is your first touch with the whole idea.

161
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:20,960
I could make these cases very easy for you and everybody would be happy. No need.

162
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:27,460
The idea is that you have to think and you have to struggle

163
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:35,210
and have this in the background, the information that you have

164
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:46,710
and this case in front of you, you will see what you could best do. This is the idea.

165
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:51,220
I could give you one more symptom because it says she has been suffering

166
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,960
with arthritis for years and different other joints have been involved.

167
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,310
Here the joint it was mentioned, which joint?

168
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:06,060
But if I put the joint, forget it, you don’t have to think.

169
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:19,970
So I took away which other joint was affected because if I put the joint that was affected,

170
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:27,060
most probably, most of you would write immediately the right remedy.

171
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:39,210
So here we have the anxious about her condition.

172
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:47,210
What am I having? Also I did not put here fear of cancer

173
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:53,260
because you will not get it always in this way.

174
00:24:54,010 --> 00:25:02,380
She says, what do I have? What? And it says, she kept on asking a lot of questions

175
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,730
concerning her condition. What is it? What do you think?

176
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:20,540
That is thinking and entering into the state of the patient who has that mentality

177
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,390
and kept on asking a lot of questions? Shall I be well?

178
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:35,640
Who is the person who does this? It is a person who has a weak will.

179
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:48,290
It is not a strong person. They don’t even mention the word.

180
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,630
The word cancer for them is a taboo.

181
00:25:53,870 --> 00:26:00,940
To mention the word, to say I have cancer or I think I have cancer…

182
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:07,430
You say, you put the question, are you afraid of having cancer?

183
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,540
They will go like this.

184
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:21,290
So what you have to read here and the solution in this case is the death of the neighbor.

185
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:36,950
There is a neighbor, it’s not a relative to justify grief and sighing

186
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:46,850
because if I said after the death of her daughter, sighing, yes Ignatia.

187
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:52,100
But after the death of a neighbor, she went to the funeral and after that

188
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,200
she felt dead people around.

189
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:08,850
Of course if I give you the exact words which I use here for a case,

190
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:14,200
you will not be able to think. You will just write the remedy and it’s no good.

191
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:22,700
Don’t worry, you will get it. Eventually you will get the system, you will get the feeling.

192
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,600
Once you learn these remedies, you have to study these remedies

193
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:38,450
and you enter to the psychology of the remedy and then you will get it but don’t be upset.

194
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:54,420
The idea is not to be mechanical but to be flexible and to see through the information

195
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,770
what you can do with this information because I give you limited information.

196
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,110
I don’t give you symptoms and symptoms and symptoms, you put the Repertory and

197
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,460
whatever comes. I give you limited information, what can you do with this information?

198
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,210
Then you have to think, you use your imagination.

199
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,690
-I did not write Calcarea carbonica, I wrote Arsenicum album

200
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:24,770
but I didn’t feel comfortable with it, I was looking for some…

201
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,130
-Where is the restlessness?

202
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,280
-Where is the compulsiveness, I couldn’t find any.

203
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,770
-Where is the fastidiousness? You could not get it through the information.

204
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:44,860
Through the information you could get this, “what do I have?

205
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:52,620
Doctor, are you sure?” This you get it from

206
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,110
the information but it is not direct. She is asking all the time, do I have cancer?

207
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:08,710
Everybody would say Agaricus. Very good but now things are a little bit more subtle.

208
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,210
We did Calcarea carbonica?
-Yes.

209
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:23,360
-There is a symptom which I have not mentioned in Calcarea carbonica.

210
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:36,860
There is a symptom in Calc. carbonica children. They enquire about the beyond.

211
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:49,260
They enquire what is an angel? What is god? What is after death? Where are you going?

212
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,510
Things like that.

213
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:59,110
I did not say because I do not give the whole information here in that step.

214
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:05,510
So the information I have given you was with the Agaricus.

215
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:16,260
I said the connection with cancer, dying, graves, dead people, ghosts all around, spooks

216
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:26,510
and I said weak willed individual that will ask a lot of questions.

217
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:35,620
I did not say will ask a lot of questions but you have to perceive it through the information.

218
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:47,360
So this could make a case of Agaricus but maybe it was too much work for you, for the afternoon.

219
00:30:53,130 --> 00:31:01,690
-No, it wasn’t too much.
-Agaricus is the remedy for Nr 19 case.
