1
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,890
The convulsions are not anymore the same as they used to be.

2
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:34,390
Most probably the child has gone to another remedy.

3
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,120
But you will tell me after six months it has gone to another remedy?

4
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:44,560
Yes, it can go to another remedy because the condition is most serious.

5
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:52,280
Most probably if they repeat now the remedy will not have an effect.

6
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,790
Actually the remedy may aggravate the situation because you are prescribing a remedy

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,470
which is not anymore indicated but still was the remedy of the child.

8
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,950
And therefore the child has a specific sensitivity towards that remedy.

9
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:15,950
You have to be very careful in this case now, to say there is a big change here,

10
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:21,450
he says convulsions, he calls them convulsions but one convulsion from another type of convulsion

11
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:27,450
is a different story. Now you have to be careful, not to make the mistakes here.

12
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,890
From here the mistakes can start. We started correctly, Cicuta.

13
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:38,820
The whole class agreed, found the remedy but you did not find it the first time.

14
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:43,800
Now we give more information, so we make it more easy.

15
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,570
Now is Cicuta? This is the question.

16
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:17,900
-Two weeks later on the 13th of February as convulsions tended to be still deteriorating,

17
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:32,720
also he was the stronger convulsions that was coming, so I gave a dose of 200

18
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:42,530
and once again nothing happened over a period of two weeks.

19
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,870
-You see now? He gives 12, he gives 200, nothing, of course nothing.

20
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,510
This is a different picture all together, how do you expect the remedy to act?

21
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:02,600
If you go according to the symptomatology they have said before, you see Kent is saying

22
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,110
if the remedy has acted, try it again.

23
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:11,100
Even if the symptoms do not agree so much but you have to have

24
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:20,200
certain of the symptoms agreeing, if you want to act, not just give it mechanically.

25
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,180
I will tell you a case where you can give it mechanically.

26
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,180
You have a mental case and you give it and he is doing very well

27
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,470
but eventually he has a boil developed or a tumor develops

28
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:44,260
and there are no symptoms to guide you to a remedy because of the tumor

29
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,260
and the other symptomatology is gone. And you have only local symptoms

30
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,020
which do not indicate any remedy. Now what are you going to do?

31
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,970
It’s a situation where the tumor develops; you may allow it

32
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,010
because you do not have any symptomatology and because the remedy has acted before,

33
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,770
you may be allowed to repeat that potency that you repeated last time.

34
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,680
Here what we have to do is to take into consideration the type of convulsions

35
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,030
and find the next remedy, what remedy is indicated.

36
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,370
So Cicuta is going to aggravate the situation.

37
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:31,860
-In the 13th of March I would have given the 12X and I gave the 12C and once again

38
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,690
there was a continuing deterioration.

39
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,540
A continuous deterioration, do you hear that?

40
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:56,280
-Through the winter his general disposition was one of irritability and a little bit of crying,

41
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,280
restlessness, a little bit of problems at night with sleeping.

42
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,520
So he’d wake maybe 2-3 times in the night and it was very difficult to pacify him,

43
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,280
we had to carry him.

44
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,940
You see how the picture has changed? In the beginning in the night when he wakes up,

45
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,530
he is very happy, now he is very aggressive and irritable

46
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:26,670
and you can not pacify him in the night, big changes. You cannot say take Cicuta anymore.

47
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:51,270
-As I said before the (?) went away to be redness and roughness of the cheeks

48
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,630
and a small (?) rash of left cheek.

49
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:11,290
Also he has this tendency to flash up very much and he flashes up quite a bit in the convulsions.

50
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:26,270
I need to prescribe on the 5th of May and that was Tuberculinum 200.

51
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:40,810
He prescribed Tuberculinum. He took the initiative and prescribed Tuberculinum for the child.

52
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,850
-Without checking with you?

53
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:54,940
-Without checking. Why should I give Tuberculinum?

54
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:08,340
-For the first time in March he started to sleep through the night

55
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:15,930
but what happened was the convulsions then got worse and took a rigidity.

56
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,430
So it was the first time that he actually had this rigidity.

57
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:25,210
You see how he pushes it forward, inside, inside again. The same process is going backwards.

58
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,180
Now he makes a few more mistakes. You will see the whole picture coming back.

59
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:37,530
You will see the automaton again. It’s not very difficult to bring back the state.

60
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:47,760
You see how sensitive we have to be, how intelligent, not to throw remedies here and there.

61
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,100
You see the result. You say, make this better, make this worse, make this better,

62
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:01,860
eventually you come back to the joby state by what you have done.

63
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,530
After two years of treatment the same situation.

64
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,710
They can easily come back, the child, to the same situation.

65
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,610
-It got worse and took a rigidity which was for the first time

66
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,500
that he actually had this rigidity in the convulsions.

67
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:32,950
-(?) in September (?)

68
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:50,590
-On the 20th of the 3rd I gave another dose of Cicuta 30.

69
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:56,330
This seemed to precipitate more convulsions and…

70
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:04,080
Do you hear that? This is mathematics. If nobody will tell me,

71
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:10,080
I would say I will tell you the reaction and I would quote the same words. Why?

72
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,080
Because I know the child has a sensitivity to Cicuta, Cicuta is not anymore indicated,

73
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,560
the child is in a sensitive state, it’s going to affect him.

74
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:42,680
-So there was no (?) and the other stage he was getting to the point

75
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,880
where he had been-not as frequently as before - on (?)

76
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,550
and so the state of the convulsions at this point returned to where

77
00:09:53,650 --> 00:10:00,300
it was being drawn to a fit, he was fixing up

78
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:08,790
and then he was slowly extending all his (?) very rigidly

79
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:19,750
and as he extended you could see the look on his face which was

80
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:26,390
staring eyes, a lot of twitching and jerking of the facial muscles,

81
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:32,050
especially around the mouth and often the jaws went over to one side

82
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,880
and also a lot of flickering, twitching and

83
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,810
jerking in the eyes and clenching of the tooth…

84
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:57,390
-Here is the remedy now. He quoted, he said symptoms indicating the right remedy now.

85
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:12,650
What is the right remedy? Just repeat a little bit.

86
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:29,540
-…slowly extending all his (?) very rigidly (?) and as he extended you could see

87
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:40,880
the look on his face which was staring eyes, a lot of twitching and jerking of the facial muscles,

88
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,380
specially around the mouth and often the jaws went over to one side

89
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:54,810
and also a lot of flickering, twitching and jerking in the eyes and clenching of the tooth.

90
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:06,710
At that point (?) he was very extended, this is a difference

91
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:14,960
that we found in the convulsions now, before he was going to a fully extended position (?).

92
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,630
Now what’s happening is he is reaching an extended position but the head is not going back,

93
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:29,130
rather at that point when the convulsions ceases, the jerking

94
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:40,220
that is occurring right through the convulsion becomes less (?)

95
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:51,220
After a period of 30 seconds of relaxation, he then goes back

96
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:59,880
into the extended position like this for a short time with no violence

97
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:09,130
but the breathe once again is held back by the jerking and then he would come off

98
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:16,630
and after that the (?) very deeply.

99
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:43,400
-(?) to breathe, just continue (?)
-(?) constriction in the throat.

100
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:59,800
-His feet will be like this but the whole thing extends like that, it’s a very rigid,

101
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:15,150
the (?) is tremendously rigid and the extension is slow and rigid and the face and distortion…

102
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:27,650
The eyes (?) and I think (?) to the right side.

103
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:52,050
(?) where before there was actually going back a sort of arch (?) and before there was the (?)

104
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:56,560
Put the next follow up, all the information, they call me on the telephone.

105
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:02,640
I’m not taking the case here, somebody else who is taking the case and sent the tape

106
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,650
and I saw the tape and we call on the telephone and on this information

107
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,650
and what he told me, I prescribed Zincum 200.

108
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:25,930
And there is the last follow up which comes a month later and they sent it to me

109
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:31,190
just a few days before I arrived here and I will give you the latest news,

110
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:37,880
which I know by telephone just before I came here.

111
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,950
That’s beginning of August.

112
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:46,630
I think he is doing better.

113
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,460
Many are not so much enthusiastic.

114
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:09,190
I will give you the follow up, you can see the whole follow up in the afternoon.

115
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:14,350
What I want to give you is the latest news about him.

116
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:26,850
About 7 or 8 days ago I received a telephone call from his father

117
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:53,270
who said that the child had high fever, had auscultatory sounds in his lungs indicating bronchitis,

118
00:17:53,370 --> 00:18:01,870
gave me symptoms of Sanicula.

119
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:10,410
I wrote Sanicula because of certain symptomatology or the possibility of Bryonia,

120
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:15,400
the child took Sanicula with no effect, Bryonia with no effect,

121
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:22,150
after two days they phoned again, it was a very high fever over 40,

122
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,490
the child was not going into convulsions.

123
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:30,730
In spite of the very high fever but the child was looking really exhausting,

124
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,490
he could not eat anything, he had difficulty in breathing

125
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:41,660
and I understood he had a kind of bronchopneumonia.

126
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:52,660
They gave me again the symptomatology of the child and I prescribed Belladonna

127
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,860
and just one day before leaving from here, he called again and said he is much better

128
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,650
with Belladonna, repeated 2-3 times, the fever was going down, the child was coming up,

129
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:11,150
eating a little, drinking and again going back to very high fever, again Belladonna,

130
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:19,500
again better and that was the situation when I left for Aedipsos.

131
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,480
I told him in case of great emergency to call my secretary

132
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,820
and he could tell her to try to find me.

133
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:37,150
So far I have no message, I left Thursday, today is Tuesday.

134
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:47,490
Let’s hope that everything has been OK but what is important in this case is that now

135
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:54,100
the child has what we expected to have. A severe, acute condition.

136
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:00,990
After that condition if you see the child, you will see tremendous improvement

137
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:08,490
and the child may reach the point where all the children are in that condition.

138
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,160
We hope to be able to show, to demonstrate that within 2-3 years

139
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,510
but the child will be back to normal.

140
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,650
It gives us all the possibilities to believe that this has a possibility

141
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:28,650
of coming back to normal where in the beginning I had great reservations

142
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:33,650
concerning the prognosis of the case because of the pathology.

143
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,820
But here we see really on deep anatomical pathology,

144
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,650
what can be the effect of homeopathic remedy

145
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,480
and can be the effect of correct homeopathic treatment?

146
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,490
Because you see at the same time correct and wrong homeopathic treatment

147
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:56,330
and you see the effect. One goes downwards, the other goes upwards.

148
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,270
Do you understand why I talk about Homeopathy with such passion.

149
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,110
It’s not the first case I have seen.

150
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:15,290
You have seen this case, another case, another case, a dead man who rose up!

151
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:23,270
Almost things like that. Now what do you expect me to do? They say George is fanatic.

152
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:28,020
I don’t know how much fanatic.

153
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:35,770
Someone who is fanatic would go outside shouting all over the place. Wake up.

154
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:42,940
Here is a system with fantastic possibilities, you just throw it to the gutter,

155
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,940
where University to teach, where do you go to learn? You have come from all over the place,

156
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,030
you should have one University in each country to be able to teach and to learn this science

157
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:58,520
and nobody does anything and that really gets me.

158
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:10,940
Because I don’t want to show you only successes, I told you a failure we had with the case

159
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:18,440
with cancer and I’m going to show you another failure which we have with a man,

160
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:24,970
because you like to see some failures, right? You love it.

161
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:33,110
So I will show you a case where we failed, failed, failed

162
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:38,040
and I will let you evaluate the situation.

163
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:56,620
-In this case why did we give Zincum?
-Why Zincum? Because I like Zincum.

164
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,610
The way he described…

165
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:10,430
Zinc is much more important for convulsions but what he said,

166
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:17,520
he said the twitchings are so prominent and the distortions…

167
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,520
-Agaricus?

168
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:25,520
-Agaricus also but not to that extend and I can’t remember now

169
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,610
because we spoke on the telephone and he gave me some information and I can’t remember

170
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:41,860
but with this information also I would have given Zincum in contra distinction to Agaricus.

171
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,350
Agaricus can be indicated but it’s not as deep as Zinc.

172
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:52,850
Zinc is a much deeper remedy when the nervous system is involved.

173
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:57,110
Where Agaricus more peripheral nerves.

174
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,860
Here it is not only peripheral nerves, it’s the nerve endings.

175
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,360
It’s also affecting the system on a much deeper level

176
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,860
which I would prefer Zinc for that reason.

177
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:22,180
Also I conjecture that there is a kind of skin eruption in the whole situation.

178
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,700
We have depression of skin eruption and we have convulsions.

179
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:34,190
The skin eruption is coming up and this is very much Zinc and not Agaricus.

180
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:39,940
Zinc is having symptoms after suppressed eruptions. It is one of the main remedies.

181
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:48,310
So I can see the connection between suppressed eruption and convulsions.

182
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:57,860
-George, you mentioned normality. Normality for a Down child or normality for…?

183
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:05,770
-Normality for a Down child. I don’t claim that we cure the child and will become normal.

184
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:10,220
It will become a normal for a Down child.

185
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:21,210
-(?)

186
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:43,790
-Tomorrow morning will read this and I will tell you why not this and that.

187
00:25:48,800 --> 00:26:00,290
Read the Oenanthe. What page it is? Page 479.

188
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:15,300
You want to read the pieces?

189
00:26:53,130 --> 00:27:00,020
Red spots, wait a moment. Don’t take that as a red spot, this is an eruption.

190
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,030
In this child we have the appearance of an eruption.

191
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:17,360
It’s very good, you pass, good idea but I’ll give you some more explanation perhaps for Zincum.

192
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:25,600
First of all here what it means is a red spot, it is a discoloration, it is not an eruption.

193
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:33,610
Here we have the appearance of an eruption, which withdraws and comes out

194
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:41,610
and goes back and comes out and as it goes outward and inward,

195
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,860
we have the appearance of convulsions or twitchings or whatever.

196
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:54,370
So it appears to have a connection between the eruption and the convulsions.

197
00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:02,780
Now if we want to know which is the main remedy that has twitchings, convulsions,

198
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:11,770
chorea etc. after suppressed eruption, it is Zincum, not Oenanthe. So that is one thing.

199
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:24,860
The second thing is that when the main point…

200
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,360
You have convulsions but the main point was the convulsions

201
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:35,110
and the frightfulness of the convulsions. That was the main point.

202
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:40,860
Now the father suddenly says, a lot of twitchings in the face,

203
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,610
stresses an another point all together.

204
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:49,280
Therefore the emphasis should be on that point.

205
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,020
Which is the remedy that produces a lot of twitchings?

206
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:02,280
And then he says, in the night the child was calm and was happy.

207
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:13,110
Now in the night is screaming, moaning etc. and we know that Zinc,

208
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:24,110
I have described to you in the Zincum how the child is irritated in the night and screams.

209
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:33,450
Screaming, great irritation in the night, screaming in the night, the irritation is so much

210
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:41,440
that the child will not be able to stand and move, especially his legs in Zincum,

211
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:49,720
but here what made me decide on Zincum and not on Agaricus and not on Oenanthe

212
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,680
and not on another remedy is the fact that we have these three points.

213
00:29:53,780 --> 00:30:08,420
We have convulsion with facial twitchings. Who has seen this Zincum boy?

214
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,560
You remember how he was doing this?

215
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,820
From that point then it goes bigger and bigger and bigger until we reached the convulsions,

216
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:29,070
until we reached facial twitchings etc. and you saw the character of the boy.

217
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,220
Irritated and you see it in children, especially children who have vaccination,

218
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:41,300
after Sebi vaccination for poliomyelitis.

219
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:48,130
After vaccination for poliomyelitis you see Zincum side effects,

220
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:55,050
where the child becomes irritated, it is very irritable, it’s screaming,

221
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:03,900
it’s not in peace at all and they scream like…

222
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:15,230
It’s something which frightens you, the screaming of Zincum in the night.

223
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:40,120
In this case where we have a really deep pathology,

224
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:51,060
the atrophy of the cerebellum is confirmed by the scanning of the brain.

225
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:56,450
To have an effect on this level, you have to give the right remedy.

226
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,450
Forget an effect without the right remedy.

227
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,950
In little things you may have an effect without the correct remedy,

228
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:08,800
you go around, around and eventually he is OK.

229
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:21,030
You have a sciatica and the remedy is Kali iodine and you never give it

230
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:32,280
and you give Lycopodium, Lachesis, Colocynthis, Gnaphalium, Nux vomica.

231
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:40,540
Nux vomica is around now because it is about 15 days and every 5 days a remedy

232
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:48,110
and it’s walking now but if you give the right remedy never mind how severe it is.

233
00:32:48,210 --> 00:33:03,620
If it not a slip disc, if the disc has not broken and pressing, if it’s a real sciatica,

234
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,950
it has to come back within a few days, 2-3 days he has to walk with the right remedy

235
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,870
but with the wrong remedy he will walk after 15 days. It goes around, around, around.

236
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:23,870
In this case you can have an effect, he is not going to walk with the wrong remedy.

237
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:32,120
You have to go deep and get the right response from a deep level.

238
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:37,110
Here the cerebellum is shrinking; he was going to stay like that,

239
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:43,940
the child was going to stay paralyzed the whole of his life and in a few months

240
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,690
to make that child stand or walk is a miracle.

241
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:55,020
For me that I know Homeopathy, I know the effect of Homeopathy, still I say my god

242
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,620
what possibilities we have and we do not know.

243
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:14,270
What is most pleasing for me is to see the laws, we have principles.

244
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:23,460
They telephone and they say, he has pneumonia severe, very high fever.

245
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:30,140
He has over 40, no convulsions? No convulsions.

246
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,960
The child is very peaceful, it is exhausted most probably

247
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:46,970
but what it happens you have to understand all these things to appreciate

248
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,250
and to understand what you are doing.

249
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:56,100
An organism is accepting an inflammation on a level.

250
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:05,480
If it accepts an inflammation on the meninges, it’s going to be a severe inflammation.

251
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:11,960
If accepts an inflammation on a lower level, on a cerebellum, cerebellitis is lower

252
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,960
but still is very severe.

253
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:21,460
If accepts an inflammation on the lungs is better than the cerebellum

254
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:28,750
and if it accepts an inflammation on the tonsils where usually we have children with good health,

255
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:38,970
you see fever 40-41-42 and still they are alive and then tonsillitis.

256
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:46,470
It accepts the inflammation, does not allow the inflammation to go on a deeper level.

257
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:51,470
What is going to happen with that child that accepted the inflammation so deep,

258
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:57,460
as it comes up, it’s going to accept and inflammation on a level which is better

259
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:04,430
but still it’s going to be severe. And this is the situation we have here.

260
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:15,320
And we have to manage. During the acute treatment I gave two remedies

261
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:24,930
that were wrong most probably, Sanicula and Bryonia. And the third remedy acted. That’s no good.

262
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:32,010
It may delay the progress of the case in general.

263
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:43,660
You have to understand that, acute manifestations are not separate from the chronic conditions.

264
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,400
As the person progresses in chronic conditions, we have acute manifestations.

265
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,660
Progresses more, another acute manifestation, progresses more.

266
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:59,430
This is a whole organism who is progressing, who is doing that.

267
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:06,330
At the point where you don’t come with the right remedy, it may still be severe,

268
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:12,320
like the case I mentioned to you with the cancer, metastasis etc.

269
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:22,070
As it was coming up, the heart was giving because the cancer on that level was pushed down

270
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,660
and the heart gave in. The heart gave in? You have to give the right remedy.

271
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,860
Otherwise he will die, the child if it doesn’t get the right remedy, it will die.

272
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,590
It will go to pneumonia and die.

273
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:40,590
It’s very severe still, it is in a serious condition.

274
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:47,360
That’s why you have to understand now this is serious, be careful, don’t just throw remedies.

275
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:55,350
This is a case where you can not afford to say by telephone, take that.

276
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:03,990
You will say why you did it? I can not fly to New Zealand and prescribe.

277
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:05,860
-Yes you can!

278
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:16,090
-I know but I don’t know if I will arrive dead or alive in New Zealand.

279
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:25,840
It’s 25 hours of travelling, I can not take it but that’s not the case.

280
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:31,160
He is meaning another thing of course, not for the child, for other children…

281
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:42,160
But you have to have in mind all these things and when he tells me,

282
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:49,330
I have kept him one hour on the telephone, asking all kinds of questions,

283
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:55,580
still the picture may not be correct.

284
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,830
When I ask you to describe this child, you describe it in a different way, each one of you.

285
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:08,670
No one gave me the main points which I wanted, which I looked.

286
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:14,580
And it’s very important for those that supervise others.

287
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:21,410
When a case is not going well, they say bring me the case, I want to see the case.

288
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:24,270
It’s a different picture all together.

289
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,910
I wanted just to tell you a little story, just to show you the importance

290
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:37,440
of seeing really the patient.

291
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:45,570
I wanted to go to Mount Athos in Greece. Mount Athos is a mount where all monks are.

292
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,410
It’s a great tradition. There it was a monk that I wanted to see very much,

293
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,920
I have heard he is very sick and accepts nobody.

294
00:39:54,020 --> 00:40:00,160
So for years I had in my mind I want to see this man but he is sick

295
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,660
and he was really very sick.

296
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,160
At a certain point I received a telephone call from one of my students in Thessaloniki.

297
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,500
He says, would you help me with a case? Yes, which is the case?

298
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,840
This is the case, this monk.

299
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:25,250
I wanted to help him naturally because I wanted to see, he is the spiritual head of Athos.

300
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:34,240
It’s something special, I put all my attention, he told me and I can’t make out, head or tails.

301
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:37,440
I suggest three remedies for him.

302
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,370
He goes and gives all the remedies, one after the other, quickly

303
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:50,130
and later on I received a telephone call, no effect, pains, pains, he can’t walk, he

304
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:56,220
lies down, he is paralysed. He said, would you come to see him? I said, of course.

305
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:06,880
I take the plane and go to see the old man. I enter his cell, it is almost like a cave,

306
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:19,980
a little place, he was lying down there because he could not walk and I see the scenery.

307
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,620
What I see? What I see it’s a Sulphur picture.

308
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:34,880
And there is an eruption and I knew it, he had an eruption before.

309
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,450
He was (?) the eruption.

310
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:42,130
Is the eruption still there? Not as bad as it was before. It was withdrawn with cortisone.

311
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:48,380
Father put cortisone, all the doctors that went to visit him and prostrate to him,

312
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,460
say put cortisone and he was putting cortisone of course, he did not know,

313
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,810
the whole thing was inside.

314
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,710
Of course we had told him already to stop cortisone and all that but no effect.

315
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:09,550
We talked about not his case, what shall I ask a monk? What do you ask?

316
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,660
Are you afraid of dying or something like that?

317
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:23,540
But it was like an enlightenment, I wanted to help him

318
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,290
and I had prescribed three remedies already, no effect and as soon as I entered,

319
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:31,380
it was like a light.

320
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:48,380
He said, my legs are swollen, his stomach was perforated

321
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,210
by all the medicines he had taken before, the eruption…He says,

322
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:59,450
do you think if I shall walk again?

323
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:06,650
I said, not only you will go but you will go for pilgrimage to that monastery.

324
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:13,900
I had no idea that this place was four hours away from the monastery.

325
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:20,310
He says, I can’t get out of the cave, it’s four hours.

326
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:28,150
I said, god anyhow the next time I come you will come to meet me outside.

327
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:35,900
So I said to the doctor Sulphur low potency to come up slowly with low potencies.

328
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,970
I went back to see him two months after and by the time I arrived in the monastery,

329
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:49,970
he was outside doing something and he came to meet me, just for the prophecy

330
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,820
I said next time you will meet me outside.

331
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,520
I don’t know if he had been yet to the place that I promised him.

332
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:02,820
I didn’t promise, I just said it like that but he went to Mount Sina.

333
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:10,120
Mount Sina is near Egypt and he went for a pilgrimage there.

334
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:15,760
It’s now 4-5 years and he is doing fine. He is 76 now.

335
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:24,110
But it was just one look, why? Because I saw the important points.

336
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:32,390
And it’s not that I did not pay attention or you did not hear the symptomatology.

337
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:40,480
It is what we know about the different remedies, this remedy gives emphasis on that point.

338
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:48,170
And that is how we prescribe finally and we decide.

339
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,310
Oenanthe very good prescription, Agaricus very good prescription,

340
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:59,810
Arsenicum not a good prescription, Calcarea carbonica not a good prescription

341
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,660
but Zinc is the best.

342
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:20,670
-Is it possible to use this information with (?)

343
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:26,340
-Not to base your prescription on that.

344
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,310
You can take it into consideration in your analysis but not base your prescription.

345
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:42,660
Here in this case I don’t know. I would not have considered it strongly.

346
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:59,660
I can’t remember now. I tried to find out but the parents could not remember anything.

347
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:06,550
We didn’t discussed about this.

348
00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:16,090
The child dropped and the child appeared to have no effect from that drop.

349
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:23,140
I think the child was given Arnica, something like that

350
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:32,140
but can we take into consideration, perhaps not.

351
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:45,730
We can not prescribe upon this information because we do not have really hard facts.

352
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:50,720
The child remained unconscious for one minute.

353
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:57,310
One minute is all right but the child nothing happened, they just picked him up

354
00:46:57,410 --> 00:47:00,420
and children fell like cats.

355
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:15,560
Yes it is indicated (?) but I do not mention it because I do not take it into consideration.

356
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:21,830
Because somebody will get up and say, wait a moment, nothing happened to the child.

357
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,310
-Are the Down children more sensitive than normal children?

358
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:30,650
-I don’t know. I don’t think so.

359
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:38,740
No he was not.

360
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:48,140
The child was vaccinated before or after and the answer is no.

361
00:47:48,240 --> 00:48:02,480
-(?)

362
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:09,080
-They were living under some power lines and there is a theory lately with the power lines.

363
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:15,230
-The father always mentioned big convulsions.

364
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:27,390
We saw yesterday the tape (?) I got the impression that the child had very small fits.

365
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:39,660
The child was sitting there (?)

366
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:49,320
-You mean now? You mean on the follow up or the initial?

367
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,640
-On the follow up.

368
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:57,260
-We can put it back and we see it.

369
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:05,890
-Why do you say (?)

370
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:20,240
-I have just explained that. The organism in order to accept a disease on a deep level,

371
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:29,240
like this kind of condition, needs a defense system which is compromised

372
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:32,740
and then accepts a disease.

373
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:47,250
Why a child that is playing normal and is normal comes down with encephalomyelitis?

374
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,830
And another child playing together he does not?

375
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:58,320
His immune system is prone to develop this severe condition.

376
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:07,570
So the child, as he progresses in health, his immune system becomes stronger.

377
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:18,220
He will accept a kind of same seriousness in a less serious organ.

378
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:26,730
-The lung?
-The lung. It could have been the kidneys, yes.

379
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:37,060
But I don’t say definitely lungs. I could have said a urinary infection.

380
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:50,650
I don’t want you to understand that he would definitely had a pulmonary problems.

381
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,480
He could have a urinary infection.

382
00:50:57,730 --> 00:51:00,230
Put back.

383
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:24,130
The intention is to go and get it. This is very important.

384
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:28,320
The contact with the outside world is established.

385
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:12,310
You see the cerebellum is not functioning properly.

386
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,810
I have not seen that.

387
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,070
-He smiles.

388
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,490
He seems to become more and more secure.

389
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:06,390
He is trying to do it himself, he understands that they want him to walk.

390
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:08,270
It’s very interesting.

391
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:28,980
How many have seen the cerebelitis case? The Ignatia case. How many have not seen?

392
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:38,380
A similar, not similar this is much more severe, but a similar case of paralysis

393
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:47,800
due to the cerebellum, walked in the third day, got up and walked.

394
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:55,550
These children they relearn how to stand and how to walk because they lose it completely.

395
00:54:55,650 --> 00:55:01,800
It’s like starting from the very beginning to walk, this is three and a half years old,

396
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:07,310
it’s learning now at the age of 12 months, how to walk.

397
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:16,560
-It can walk at 2-3 years.

398
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:24,320
-Yes but in this way can walk at 15 months.

399
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:32,220
-No they never walk in 15 months.

400
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,210
-In this way?

401
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:40,560
-No, when they start they are usually 2 or 3 years.

402
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:48,810
-The usual children can start walk in one year. 13,14 months,

403
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:58,800
in 15 months onwards the Down children can start doing this. 15,16,17 not three and a half.

404
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:07,050
But anyhow this child would never had walk the whole of his life with the atrophy

405
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:09,800
of the cerebellum would never had walk.

406
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,990
I would like you to see another case that will do that.

407
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:26,900
It’s not that he walks, he does not walk. It’s the fact that he becomes a human being again,

408
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:33,810
this is the main thing but the cerebellum definitely is functioning again

409
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,910
and this is the main thing again.

410
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:47,230
I hope to be able to show you this child at the age of 5 or 6

411
00:56:47,330 --> 00:57:03,160
and he will be a normal Down child, where it was an autistic child, totally autistic child.

412
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:17,480
What improvement is, these children are sensitive to infections, very sensitive.

413
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:23,810
They get severe, frequent infections. You may bring them to the point

414
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:29,640
where they do not get so frequently infections. They eat better, they feel better,

415
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:39,470
their mind functions better but still they remain with the congenital problem.

416
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,640
For living?

417
00:57:55,630 --> 00:58:00,540
I have not so much experience. I will not tell you I have seen 100 cases.

418
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,300
I have seen a few cases of this.

419
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:32,220
She says that they never have an IQ more than 40 and they can never write.

420
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:54,280
Let’s not go to that argument because we all know that we have several groups,

421
00:58:54,380 --> 00:59:01,780
several severities of the disease.

422
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:13,850
What we are concerned here is how to find the right remedy and do whatever is possible to do.

423
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:20,150
What we are showing with the video is what is possible to do, if we prescribe correctly

424
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:26,450
and the remedy is correct for different reasons and this is the result if we do it correctly.

425
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:36,460
Anybody else?

426
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,950
-A question about the cancer case?

427
00:59:47,790 --> 01:00:00,930
You said that the bones (?) metastasis quite quickly (?) how long (?)

428
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:10,600
-It depends on the organism. You can not say after 3 or after 6 days or a month.

429
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,580
You can’t say.

430
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:24,550
When we have a metastasis case, we usually get it when they are metastised

431
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:30,390
either on the brain or the bones. When these cases come to us they say,

432
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:38,390
can you do something? So my experience is that these cases they will die,

433
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:42,640
if they come to that stage.

434
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:50,740
You can not cure them completely and have them living for another 10 years.

435
01:00:51,250 --> 01:01:03,060
But my experience is that the pains are reduced from a few days, let us say after one week

436
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:13,320
or within a month, in this space of time they are reduced and they appear to be doing well.

437
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:19,470
There is a time where there is a relapse of the pains.

438
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:24,300
If the relapse comes, then its’ much more difficult to control

439
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,810
because you need to change remedies etc.

440
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:31,390
And you control it and then relapse, more difficult.

441
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:40,640
Then there is a point where you will need to give pain killers, derivatives of morphine.

442
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:48,140
In that moment, as soon as you start the morphine you have a dead person, the pain continues,

443
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:54,080
it goes steadily up, stronger, stronger, stronger, more the morphine and they die.

444
01:01:55,110 --> 01:02:00,570
This is the pattern which I have experienced with cancer cases.

445
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:19,470
I had a case with a big tumor, metastasis and diffused.

446
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:26,220
She came after a year, she says I’m all right, no pains, nothing.

447
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:34,480
A year later it was a relapse, severe pains again, I could not control them, morphine,

448
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:38,390
in the hospital, 10 days she went away.

449
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:44,070
I have a case now in London from a hospital, I don’t remember the hospital,

450
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:50,640
an English hospital who are treating her and she came to Athens to be treated,

451
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:56,140
metastasis on the bones and the brains. Several points in the brains

452
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:05,500
and several points in the joint here.

453
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:14,990
It was eaten up the bone, she came with…

454
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:27,810
I said I’m sorry I can’t do anything, this has too far gone, metastasis on the brain

455
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:33,170
and metastasis on the bones, too much pains and she was taking pain killers.

456
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:42,640
She said, no I had a message from god that you are going to cure me.

457
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:47,640
I said, I can’t cure you, never mind the message, you have the message

458
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,660
but I don’t have the means to cure you.

459
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:59,040
No she says, I’m positive and she (?) through my secretary in London,

460
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:04,790
I refused the case and she went through a friend and another friend and they pressed me,

461
01:04:04,890 --> 01:04:08,370
I did not know she was the same woman.

462
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:13,060
When she came I found out she was the same but I had refused.

463
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:18,210
I said no, I can’t give you she was taking chemotherapy and she was taking pain killers.

464
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:25,460
I can’t, forget it and she said, no I’m telling you that god has told me,

465
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,960
she was absolutely positive that god had told her…

466
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:36,970
I said maybe the fact that she is so assured, maybe I have to do something.

467
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:42,710
I took her case and the doctor we took the case together is here.

468
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:52,070
I took her case and Platina came out clearly.

469
01:04:53,560 --> 01:05:01,790
I said god, maybe the message was right because usually in such cases

470
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:05,140
you do not get a clear picture.

471
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:12,470
So I prescribed. She said, what about the chemotherapy?

472
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:20,860
I said, if you take together with chemotherapy maybe the medicine I’m going to give you

473
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,860
is not going to work.

474
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,040
OK, then I stop the chemotherapy and I stop the pain killers.

475
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:31,870
I said, you can’t stop the pain killers and you can’t stop the chemotherapy.

476
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:34,610
She says, why? Because the pains are going to be so severe

477
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:38,990
that you are going to jump out of your bed.

478
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:49,460
She said, no if you say that it is going to interfere, I will stop. I said god.

479
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:58,640
She was there convinced absolutely, she had come, actually she had told my secretary

480
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:02,450
she will pay 10.000 £ for one visit.

481
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:08,140
She was a rich woman but I said never mind if she pays me 1.000.000 I can’t see her

482
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,900
I said to my secretary. She telephoned again and I said forget it

483
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,710
and then she tried with a friend and she was there. That is the whole story.

484
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:22,690
She was so convinced that if I see her, she will be all right.

485
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:29,440
I said maybe what they call autosuggestion, maybe I should not take away her hope

486
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:33,870
but I could not promise anything. She says, you are going to treat me?

487
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:40,110
I said, no and I have to say it plainly no I can not cure you, it’s too far gone.

488
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:43,290
No, I know you will cure me.

489
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:52,690
Immediately she stops pain killers, stops the chemotherapy.

490
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:54,200
-What potency?

491
01:06:54,300 --> 01:07:03,950
-High potency 1M and I gave low potencies as well 12, at the same time, one every day.

492
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:13,450
She calls me after a week, I said how are you doing? Fine she says.

493
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:20,530
What do you mean fine? She says, I’m fine. You don’t have pains? No.

494
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:28,940
How is your appetite? Oh it’s great.

495
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:32,690
You mean you are eating? Yes, I’m eating, I put on weight.

496
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:36,450
You put on weight within a week? Yes.

497
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:46,030
How is your general state and everything? Fine. OK call me after 15 days.

498
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:52,610
She calls me after 15 days, when I told her to call she would call immediately.

499
01:07:52,710 --> 01:08:01,940
She calls after 15 days, she is doing fine. Initially I told her I want to see her after a month.

500
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:24,030
After a month she comes there without the stick, better appetite, looking different person.

501
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:30,530
I said go back, we continue. One day I receive a telephone call

502
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:35,030
and she was screaming on the telephone. I broke my rib she says.

503
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:41,280
How do you know? I don’t know how it happened but I’ve broken my rib. (?)

504
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:46,530
She said no but the pain is severe, in the whole night I have not slept,

505
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:51,620
the pain is tremendous and I’m sure I broke my rib. I said, you did not break your rib,

506
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,860
it is just the cancer pains, I told you.

507
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:59,540
You said, you are going to stand the pain, now stand the pain.

508
01:09:03,290 --> 01:09:13,440
Now morphine again. I said OK, try again Platina 1M and if within 24 hours

509
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:17,030
the pains will not stop, you will have to take morphine again.

510
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:23,440
She tries the Platina and the pains stop immediately and while she was taking Platina 12

511
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:26,530
and the pain stopped immediately.

512
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:29,720
How do you explain that?

513
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:37,580
The cancer is better? She said I’m better, what do you think am I going to be cured?

514
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:41,830
I said I don’t know if you are cured but what you are telling me that you are better,

515
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:46,580
the remedy is acting, you have more appetite, more energy…

516
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:51,910
In London I saw her after three and a half months. She comes without a stick,

517
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:55,440
she was jumping, she said, I’m dancing now.

518
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:02,920
In the meantime in the hospital they monitor her.

519
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:07,750
I said they have to monitor you, so they give me the feedback from the hospital.

520
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:15,000
Every time she would go to the hospital, they say no, no you are having cancer,

521
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:18,250
you have to understand that you have cancer, you can not be cured.

522
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:24,750
She says, in the hospital they told me I can not be cured. I said, well they are right.

523
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:35,580
The doctor of the hospital writes a letter to the doctor with whom I have seen the patient.

524
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:41,340
He says this patient has stopped taking her chemotherapy,

525
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:45,330
while she was doing sympathetically well.

526
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:51,580
When I saw her she was doing sympathetically well with the chemotherapy.

527
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,830
Now four months, five months later where she does not take any chemotherapy,

528
01:10:55,930 --> 01:11:01,410
there is no pain, the appetite is better because she had nausea and all these things,

529
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:06,770
now she is not doing well because she is not taking her chemotherapy.

530
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:15,160
And in the letter there was a threat that her homeopath had stopped the chemotherapy.

531
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:19,500
Now you come to my position after all this.

532
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:28,240
They do not know anything of what has happened, what pressure was under, medical pressure,

533
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:30,350
whatever you want it.

534
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:35,410
And then they want feedback. They said, why don’t you give us statistics?

535
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:39,910
How can I give statistics when you write letters of that type.

536
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:46,160
She was doing sympathetically well when she came on that chair, she was eaten up.

537
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:56,670
I said to her, I never told you to stop. He writes that I told you to stop the chemotherapy.

538
01:11:56,770 --> 01:12:00,010
She says, yes but you told me to stop.

539
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:06,670
I said, I do not tell you to stop, I said the remedy will not work with the chemotherapy

540
01:12:06,770 --> 01:12:10,740
and you decided to stop the chemotherapy.

541
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:12,500
She said that’s correct.

542
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,500
It’s correct but it is different story by saying to the doctors in the hospital

543
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,250
that I told you to stop the chemotherapy.

544
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:31,580
Anyhow she gave hell to the doctors as well. She was a powerful woman and the hospital,

545
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:38,590
in the credit of the doctors finally, they telephoned a clinic

546
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:43,580
in which I’m connected as an advisor in London and they said,

547
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:50,160
we are interested to send cases to see what you can do with the alternative therapies

548
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:52,520
that you are doing there.

549
01:12:53,510 --> 01:13:00,520
But I had to tell her to start again the chemotherapy.

550
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:05,250
I said, no you start again the chemotherapy.

551
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:11,500
If she dies, she will die because she started the chemotherapy?

552
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:19,000
I do not believe that the case is cured, even the reaction I believe that we can not say

553
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,430
that the patient is cured.

554
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:35,590
Cancer, when it reaches that state, we can ameliorate the cases.

555
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:42,160
we can make them feel better, we can make them die better but they will die.

556
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:48,660
And if she had died with (?) Homeopathy, then it’s a crime

557
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:57,730
but she should have been dead 3-4 months ago. Already she is alive one year now.

558
01:13:57,830 --> 01:14:00,480
- (?) die with chemotherapy?

559
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:06,160
-It is all right if they die with chemotherapy. Nobody to be blamed.

560
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:11,090
But I have seen cases with metastasis on the brain, they don’t live more than 3-4 months,

561
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:19,690
3 months finished and she is over a year now and she is still alive.

562
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:27,690
Now in the beginning of July she started chemotherapy, so let us see what happens.

563
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:46,590
-What is the idea of 1M and 12? What is the idea that it should be given 1M first?

564
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:55,840
-It’s experimental. In cases that are severe, you give a remedy high potency

565
01:14:55,940 --> 01:15:02,840
and it gives a push but the pathology being too gross, brings back the case.

566
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:09,340
So are you going to give a push on high potency all the time? Push, high the pathology,

567
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,080
bring them back.

568
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,430
It’s something which we can not predict.

569
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:19,510
With the child with the atrophy of the cerebellum, I could not predict that he would walk.

570
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:24,430
If I had predicted that, I would say after 5 years.

571
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:39,090
Yes, when it has a relapse, I wait very carefully.

572
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:44,090
The problem with Homeopathy is the second prescription.

573
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:48,340
The second prescription is very important because that is the time

574
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:51,100
where mostly make the mistakes.

575
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:55,840
Cicuta, give it again, give it again, then Tuberculinum,

576
01:15:55,940 --> 01:16:03,440
you see again the Tuberculinum what it has done for the child.

577
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,750
It spoiled the case completely, totally.

578
01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:14,110
This boy can regress into the state in which it was originally.

579
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:21,260
And then I would like to hear an explanation, what took place and I believe this boy

580
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:30,580
if it has taken a scanning, his scanning for the cerebellum it will be normal

581
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:35,870
in two years the most, in one and a half year,

582
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:41,190
in six more months cerebellum must be in its place back.

583
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:05,380
And these Down children never stay for long periods of treatment.

584
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:09,690
You treat them for a period of time and then they disappear.

585
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:17,170
At least I have not attended cases for a long periods of time to see what happens

586
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:22,420
on a long treatment, on a correct treatment and it’s difficult to find the remedy with the Down

587
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:25,000
children, it’s very difficult because the organism is not strong enough,

588
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:29,020
is not giving out strong symptomatology.

589
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:38,260
Why we say in Homeopathy a case is incurable? Why?

590
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:49,010
If we find the remedy, the right remedy is going to act. How long is it going to act?

591
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:56,590
If the liver is destroyed at 90%, we have cirrhosis of the liver,

592
01:17:56,690 --> 01:17:59,760
you are giving the right remedy and you are going to have a good reaction.

593
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:07,010
It seems that it’s functioning but after a while everything is back, why?

594
01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:10,360
Because the organ is destroyed.

595
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:17,610
Now push again. How you are going to push? By high potencies or low potencies?

596
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:24,250
So you try first with the low and then if you need you go high.

597
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:30,500
When I had a real relapse of the pain in Platina, I again prescribed Platina high.

598
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:39,260
If I had given Platina high 1M constantly to overcome the pathology,

599
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:44,340
she would come in a relapse and I would not have any means to face that,

600
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:49,430
where I did not know whether this is right or wrong.

601
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:55,680
I’m telling you my ideas, you experiment with them, you try them out and give me your feedback.

602
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:58,800
Don’t expect me that I will give all explanation.

603
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:04,390
I’m not god that I will tell you this is what it is. I do not know everything.

604
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:11,470
I’ve given you my experience. That’s why when you come to my lectures,

605
01:19:11,570 --> 01:19:14,820
you try to get my experience, that’s all.

606
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:19,460
You go to all other teachers, wherever you can learn, to the books

607
01:19:20,740 --> 01:19:25,210
and you take everything from everybody and make your own assumptions

608
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:29,380
and your own final decisions, what is right and what is wrong.

609
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:35,220
I don’t want you to treat me as somebody who said… George said that.

610
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:40,640
Yes George said that, OK but it’s his opinion, his understanding and his experience.

611
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:42,880
That’s all I want you to understand.

612
01:19:42,980 --> 01:19:49,710
It is my experience and I’ve given it to you, you try, you experiment, you find another way.

613
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:55,960
I went to India, they invited me there to give lectures and many doctors came

614
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:58,980
and I said you are talking about not repeating the remedy.

615
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:06,570
I’ll show you, she pulls out pictures of (?).

616
01:20:10,810 --> 01:20:19,220
All these cases have been cured by CN potencies every day. For how long? For

617
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:25,710
months. 6 months, 7 months. What shall I say?

618
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:31,220
This is his experience. The only thing I said I would like to see these cases

619
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:38,970
and examine them myself, how they were in the beginning and how they are now, the cure.

620
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:47,290
And if I’m happy with what took place, I will change my mind and I will try it myself.

621
01:20:47,390 --> 01:20:51,630
But if somebody wants to do that and believes that this is the right thing,

622
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:53,880
I said another experiment.

623
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:58,220
I said, you come to me and I find for you the remedy, your remedy

624
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:04,320
and this remedy you take in CN for three months. First yourself.

625
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:13,490
You take it for three months yourself and then if you have good results, give it to your patients.

626
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:20,220
Then I will believe that you are honest in what you say.

627
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:24,220
But you come to me, don’t take any remedy that has nothing to do with you.

628
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,220
I can take for proving any remedy but it’s not going to help.

629
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:37,800
But the right remedy given in a high potency 4 months, I believe it’s going to do some damage.

630
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:43,150
I have not done it myself or to anybody.

631
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:45,800
-So you think it was necessary (?) to give the 12?

632
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:53,130
-Yes I thought it was necessary but maybe it’s wrong, I can’t prove that it is right.

633
01:21:54,740 --> 01:22:07,130
-(?)

634
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:08,890
-We can’t hear you.

635
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:23,410
-Can we use auxiliary means like herbal medicines and low potencies in different remedies?

636
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:31,400
-From my point of view I would say no. It doesn’t mean because I say no, you don’t do it.

637
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:39,360
Please go ahead and do it but for me it’s very difficult to understand the logic.

638
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:43,310
If I give high potency or low potency, there is a kind of logic.

639
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:49,550
Because if the high potency does not work, the disease is in low potency,

640
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:54,050
maybe the low potency will work and these cases are severe cases.

641
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:56,800
She was going to give up morphine.

642
01:22:56,900 --> 01:22:59,800
And she would go home and would scream from pains.

643
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:05,550
I had to cover the case in every way possible, that is my logic

644
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:17,300
but also if I give another means, herb or other, how do I know which remedy has really acted

645
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:20,310
and how to proceed after that? This is a problem.

646
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:25,130
You see this case Cicuta. He gave Tuberculinum, he gave Cicuta again

647
01:23:25,230 --> 01:23:30,470
and I said it’s going to do some wrong. But if I did not know

648
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:39,720
that have given in the beginning Zinc, Agaricus, Cicuta… Then what shall I do next?

649
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:45,970
On occasion of your question, I take the opportunity to express some ideas.

650
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:47,580
Don’t worry.

651
01:23:55,070 --> 01:23:59,490
If I would give morphine? Yes.

652
01:23:59,990 --> 01:24:06,640
-Potentized morphine?
-No, never.

653
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:12,720
I have not tried and I do not believe that it can act as a palliative,

654
01:24:12,820 --> 01:24:15,570
a high potency of morphine.

655
01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:25,980
-Taking the doctors to Court?

656
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:31,680
-Yes, I got this paper from this lady the day afterwards, then I knew better.

657
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:38,110
I said, that is the games you are playing? Now you give me this paper and she signs.

658
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:40,450
She says, I will sign anything.

659
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:48,860
Also I’m not in a problem because I never charged anything anybody. I just give advice.

660
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,210
Still all right.

661
01:25:10,460 --> 01:25:21,950
Roger has a case from the time he was studying with us in Athens, a case of (?)

662
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:59,440
-(?) He took one dose of chemotherapy and he became (?) and I think you had said,

663
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:00,380
I remember the case.

664
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:05,600
how the (?) became better and he said from chemotherapy and you asked

665
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:10,220
what chemotherapy did he take and he says (?).

666
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,710
-Did you hear that story?

667
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:24,770
It’s very interesting because Roger said how is that possible

668
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:33,780
that chemotherapy would make him better mentally and emotionally except of the real,

669
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:39,780
physical problem and I said what was in the chemotherapy? That’s very interesting

670
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:43,030
because I’m in inquisity.

671
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:55,880
In this chemotherapy was his remedy? He goes and asks him and he says, Platina.

672
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:00,870
It was an oxide of Platina.

673
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:26,030
-(?) and he had symptoms of recurrence of the tumor and (?)

674
01:27:26,130 --> 01:27:41,580
He was in NY going to all houses with homosexual and all (?) died from (?)

675
01:27:57,550 --> 01:28:03,360
-You see we can not claim that we cure cancer with Homeopathy.

676
01:28:03,460 --> 01:28:07,870
This we have to understand, if we go outside and we say, we cure cancer by Homeopathy,

677
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:13,860
between us we can discuss such cases but if we go out and we say we cure cancer,

678
01:28:13,960 --> 01:28:17,690
they will attack and they will vicious and they will be right

679
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:20,690
because we don’t have the right to say, we cure cancer.

680
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:27,230
There are some cases of cancer which are cured in question mark.

681
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:34,870
I had another case that I had, as soon as, I went back to Greece in 1967

682
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:37,440
with cancer of the breast.

683
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:40,940
She didn’t want to be operated and they said, you have to operate, otherwise you die,

684
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,700
you know the doctors.

685
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,690
She came to me, I said I can not treat you. In ’67,

686
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:48,950
as soon as I came to Greece immediately to treat all the cancer cases,

687
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:51,530
then they would put me in jail.

688
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:55,520
She said, no I will die but I will not have an operation.

689
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:56,530
She persuaded me to treat her.

690
01:28:56,630 --> 01:29:01,620
I treated her, a few years later, she went back to the hospital and said,

691
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:10,090
will you please make a biopsy to see what happens?

692
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:13,680
They did the biopsy, they said it’s not cancer.

693
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:22,670
She said but it was cancer and you advised me to cut my breast. They said, never.

694
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:28,500
She puts out the biopsy and says, here it is. Signed by the same man.

695
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:32,600
No, it was a mistake.

696
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:49,500
I continued to treat her. In 1984 I think, she had a relapse. From 67 to 84 she had a relapse.

697
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:59,000
I treated her, she did well. In 1986 she died from cancer without me.

698
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:09,330
She went to another town, she had another treatment, I heard she died from cancer.

699
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:13,420
Can we say we cured this cancer even if the doctors say it was a mistake

700
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:22,000
or anything like that? Can we say we cured it even after almost 20 years.

701
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:29,000
She still had a relapse after 20 years, so we can not say…

702
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:32,580
But you say, 20 years is good enough.

703
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:38,840
If I was able to promise that also, I would say yes we give it 20 years

704
01:30:38,940 --> 01:30:43,840
and it is great but we can not, there are cases and cases and cases.

705
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:48,440
-You go to die from something.
