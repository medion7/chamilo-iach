1
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,600
-So you gave me the Mercury.
-It was Mercury solubilis 10M.

2
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:38,280
-You gave me the Mercury and I was dizzy for two hours and then after a few hours

3
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,520
the constipation was gone totally, no constipation at all.

4
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:57,770
Generally I felt very good, the energy was staying up and this state maintained

5
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,370
for 21 days exactly.

6
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:14,520
22nd day collapsed to the old condlition at one day, constipation, bad mood, angry, frustrated.

7
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,770
-According to you was any reason for this?
-No.

8
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,270
-You did not drink coffee? You did not have a shock?

9
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:30,810
-No. Anyhow I went for a few weeks and in these few weeks it was aggravation more and more.

10
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:46,630
Something which I didn’t tell you last time, is that I have skin rashes which come every few years.

11
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:53,770
The first time when I had it was when I was 8 years old, then it begun again.

12
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:58,860
The expression of these skin rashes are in the beginning on the forehead and in the nose,

13
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,610
then behind the ear and then all over the head. Then the skin begins rough, peeling,

14
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:13,000
very dry and hot. I feel as if I have to take a cube of ice and put it on the forehead,

15
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,250
so it will take the itchiness.

16
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,440
Then already in a few weeks everything was aggravating, the constipation, the mood.

17
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,440
So I took by myself another dose of Mercury 10M and then exactly the same pattern happened.

18
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:34,440
21 days everything is going. Energy is good, constipation has gone totally,

19
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:43,470
the mood is very good, 22nd days collapsed in one day like this to the old condition and

20
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,770
again aggravating, aggravating, aggravating.

21
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,600
I went a few more weeks, I see I’m feeling very bad, so I took another dose of Mercury 10M

22
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,450
and then the 3rd time not so much.

23
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,350
So I thought I wait until I see and see what to do. Then in these few months,

24
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,350
there was a peculiar physical symptom which happens.

25
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:18,050
First of all I noticed, when I was young I used to be athletic, all the time sport, to exercise

26
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,270
the energy out.

27
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:28,020
I used to sweat a lot, after running I was taking the shirt like this and water would come out.

28
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,770
This time I’m running for two hours and I sweat a little bit, no sweat.

29
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,020
And the perspiration is very oily. I take the shirt like this and is like oil.

30
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:50,520
As well I noticed when I feel cold, I feel as if the body does not produce heat.

31
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:59,600
I feel generally cold, shivering a little bit or I need to move but in this winter I felt

32
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,850
as if the body is a cube of ice and the body can not produce heat.

33
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:14,100
The discharge is still there and the pain around the scar area sometimes is still there.

34
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,450
It’s always aggravated when I feel stress. When I’m stressed…

35
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:36,850
-The pain was affected by Mercury these 21 days?
-Well I can’t really say if there was any change.

36
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,850
-So where is the pain? Around the prostate?

37
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:46,940
-I felt something peculiar. I felt a few times as if the prostate is becoming hard.

38
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,840
-What about urination? You had any problems with urination?

39
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:04,340
-Sometimes I feel pitching pain in the urethra, if the bladder is too full and after. Not always.

40
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,780
Every once in a while.

41
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:19,280
-So what is the situation at this moment? You said the 3rd dose you took is so and so.

42
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:30,770
-I still feel this kind of pain and the discharge reflects that there is still an inflammation.

43
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:39,530
-What type of discharge it is? The same as it used to be or the discharge has changed?

44
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:49,420
-I can’t really say. It comes only when there is the effort to give stool.

45
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,240
If there is no constipation, the effort is stronger, so there will be more discharge.

46
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,240
But let’s say when I’m travelling to India and over there the toilets are on the floor,

47
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:06,090
so because of the pressure there is more discharge.

48
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,000
-How is your sexual energy?

49
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,570
-After the remedy it was increasing and after some time it’s normal.

50
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:34,090
-Now at this moment that you are talking what is the situation? General situation.

51
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:41,060
-Generally I feel more energetic, definitely the level of the energy is rising up.

52
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:48,560
The constipation is less severe. Every day but still very dry and very difficult.

53
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:59,060
Something which happened after I received the first dose of Mercury is that the voice

54
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:04,560
changed totally. This thing I wanted to tell you about.

55
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,810
It’s bothering me from when I was 12 or 13,14.

56
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:21,980
Whenever I’m excited or feeling stress, the throat is talking but I cannot speak.

57
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,980
I swallow my words, I speak too fast and as if the voice can not come out.

58
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,810
And when I received the first dose I was amazed, speaking freely and fluently

59
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:39,550
and no disturbance at all.

60
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,450
This kind of difficulty to speak in a clear way, to swallow the words and to speak fast,

61
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:56,060
many times has put me in a seat of lack of confidence. So if you can consider this.

62
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:05,710
-What I don’t understand is, you said about this skin eruption that came since 8 years old.

63
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:10,180
Now after the remedy it came back?

64
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:17,090
-No, there was as well some sign of it before the remedy but after the remedy it accelerated

65
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:25,360
in the extend that I’m doing like this on the head and you see snow of skin falling down.

66
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,010
-So it accelerated very much for a period of time, of how long?

67
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:41,610
-For a few months and then I feel so much bad with it, so I used chemical shampoo.

68
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,010
-With Sulphur inside?

69
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:52,260
-Yes, Sulphur and Selenium. I used it twice and then it’s all gone immediately.

70
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,010
-So it’s immediately gone. When did you use it? On 21st day?

71
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:06,540
-No, something like 2 months ago. All the face, the skin was peeling and all the head.

72
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,790
Huge amount of skin, I do it like this and like snow is falling down.

73
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:18,390
-How many times you used this shampoo?
-About 4 times all together.

74
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,390
-On consecutive days?

75
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,540
-No, whenever it’s becoming more severe I use it. Then immediately after it’s going away.

76
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,790
As well on the face, I use it on the head and even on the face it will go away,

77
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,120
although the areas which are on the face are not…

78
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,500
-… are not affected by this shampoo.
-Yes.

79
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,130
-It came in the beginning all right and you left it for how long? One month,

80
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:59,120
two months before you use this shampoo? You left this eruption for how long?

81
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:04,370
-I tried not to use it at all because I didn’t want to disturb the remedy.

82
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,400
-Yes, in the beginning for how long? One month, two months?

83
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,620
-More about 4 months until I couldn’t bear it anymore.

84
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,220
About February I began to use it because it was too much.

85
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:44,220
-Any other changes that you have noticed? Are you more organized?

86
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,620
-When you gave me the first dose, the most dramatic change that happened, the things

87
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,120
which I felt the most emotional are…

88
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:10,620
The usual pattern that used to be before is that if I go into any kind of social circumstance,

89
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:20,370
immediately I feel threatened. I feel that people want to attack me. So I close in and I can

90
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:31,290
not communicate. Then because of this entering inside and isolation of myself,

91
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:37,540
what happens is that I begin to produce energy that makes me irritable inside.

92
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:45,640
This kind of irritability makes me extreme. Let’s say I will go to another country.

93
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:55,820
Now after the remedy I feel the trigger of being threatened but I can not feel irritable.

94
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,630
I feel hopeless of not being able to do nothing, some kind of helplessness,

95
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:09,370
I can do nothing at all, I’m trying to push myself into this kind of acceleration to do something,

96
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:17,700
to go and do, to become extreme again but I can not. The organism does not produce energy

97
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,990
which makes me irritable.

98
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,790
So I experience in myself a lot of helplessness. I can not do nothing, I am exposed.

99
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,540
-So it is good or bad?

100
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,790
-I feel it’s good because after a while when it happened I began to be more observing,

101
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,890
more settling down, more quiet.

102
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,140
Another thing which happened…

103
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:59,540
-Before you used to be sloppy with your things or you used to be organized, very fastidious?

104
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:10,540
How it was this aspect? You understand? Your things in your room were disorganized

105
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,140
or were organized very much?

106
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:22,520
-I would say there is a disorganized organization. Everything is unorganized but I know

107
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,330
where it is before it’s disorganized.

108
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,050
-There is any change after the remedy on that level?

109
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:29,410
-No.

110
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:45,910
-What about your sleep?
-Sleep is good. Still a lot of saliva.

111
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,610
If anyone comes and see, the pillow is wet and still a lot of aphae.

112
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,580
-You are a pure case of Mercury. Very lucky.

113
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,080
-There is something that I wanted to tell you but I forgot.

114
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,080
-How is your self-confidence?

115
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:26,470
-Still there is a big difference between how I am and how you perceive and how I feel inside.

116
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,470
Inside I don’t feel confident.

117
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:40,060
I feel very fragile, very weak and because of this I build expression of looking strong.

118
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,610
You asked me I saw a video a few days ago, from myself in the last interview and

119
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,350
you asked me then why I became weak? What was the reason I became weak?

120
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:58,360
Now I saw it and then I realized what made me so weak? What began this degeneration

121
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,690
of the physical energy.

122
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:07,440
And I remembered that somewhere at the age of 24-25, there was something in me which

123
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:23,940
was totally into a state of desperation because of not being able to succeed in

124
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,740
these spiritual activities which I was involved.

125
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,860
Let’s say 3 years in this spiritual practice and then 2 years in this one and then 1 year…

126
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:38,110
And then I thought that I’m putting all my life energy into this philosophy or dogmatic ideas

127
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:47,140
and then in the existence in myself nothing has changed. So I began to enter into a state

128
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:54,610
of total desperation, of feeling helpless and that was a point where I felt that the whole energy

129
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,460
is going down.

130
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:04,110
And this kind of helplessness, of putting all my life into certain life style which does not

131
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:10,960
really show, how I’m helped by that or how I’m saved by that…

132
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,610
-There is a big disappointment for yourself?

133
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:22,610
-Not for myself. All my energy is leading towards, let’s say, meditation.

134
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:27,560
Doing meditation for 2 years but after 2 years of knowing all kind of meditations

135
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:36,460
and all practices and all mantras and all everything, still I find myself in the same troubles.

136
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:43,110
And this kind of realization that I’m getting nowhere and already feeling weak and arresting

137
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:51,860
all my life in something that does not give food, brought me to a very weak condition.

138
00:16:51,960 --> 00:17:04,640
And this is a situation where I can not feel confident in myself to, let’s say, the life demands

139
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:13,360
from me to do a contract. To build up my own clinic, I don’t have the guts to go and do it

140
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:17,960
because I don’t trust in me, because of all this exhaustion.

141
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,120
It’s a whole cycle of not being able to do.

142
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:33,020
-To accomplish. During this time did you ever have any metallic taste in your mouth?

143
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:42,020
-Sometimes yes and as well there is a very heavy smell from the mouth.

144
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,940
-This heavy smell is mostly in the morning on wakening?

145
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,790
-Mostly in the morning. If I eat something, it goes away.

146
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,940
-Tell me something, as a child did you suffer with ear infections?

147
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,570
-I don’t recall that.

148
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,690
-Neither now you have any problem with the ears?
-There is some, yes.

149
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:15,440
When I was 24, there was one winter in Jerusalem, where I lived where about 8 months

150
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:24,460
I bloated my nose. And so much I bloated my nose that something in the ears I felt is changed.

151
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:31,190
And since then when I bloat my nose, I feel pain in the ears and I feel that the mucus

152
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,570
is somewhere in the ears.

153
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,690
Generally I feel that the mucus is very sticky and it’s stuck on the throat,

154
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,290
I can not swallow, I can not spit out.

155
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,190
-Very good.
-What good?

156
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,790
-We’ll talk to the class. I will tell you.

157
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:44,060
In his case he related some strange phenomena. 21 days, boom, a relapse.

158
00:19:54,310 --> 00:20:06,450
I’m not sure that there is a magical number there. 21 is the magical number but

159
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:19,030
what is interesting in his case and I said, you are lucky, is the fact that when there is

160
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:27,780
a relapse and the remedy you give, it works again and then a third time and it works again,

161
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:41,550
it shows that the organism is strong and this remedy is the main remedy for the organism.

162
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:50,050
That means the organism will make its best by this remedy.

163
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,450
So in this case you don’t leave the remedy.

164
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:07,700
You have heard don’t leave the remedy if it’s acting etc. but you have to know when the remedy

165
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:16,200
is really acting deeply and acting curatively and correctly and deeply and it’s going really

166
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,700
to make a big change.

167
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,200
In these cases in spite of the fact you may have a relapse, the relapse goes back

168
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,140
to the same remedy.

169
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:34,780
You will see in contrary to the other case we saw, this case is going to start with this,

170
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:43,270
is going to go there and most probably a remedy which will be needed is Thuja in her case.

171
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:51,120
Thuja will be needed eventually but we will see how she will develop.

172
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:06,940
In this case you give Picric acid, it’s not going to have the same effect as he has.

173
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:13,440
It will affect a little bit better, a little bit better and then starts I have this symptom,

174
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:19,940
that symptom, then you struggle, then you go and find out the next remedy…

175
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:27,940
When you have mental problems, you see he has also mental problems but his mental problems

176
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:38,290
are of more superficial kind, so the remedy can clean  this.

177
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:47,530
Also being Mercury he withdraws and can not speak.

178
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:55,370
He described very beautifully the stammering of Mercury.

179
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:03,280
Stammering does not have to be there. Stammering starts from the difficulty to express,

180
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:14,060
perhaps you don’t even understand that there is a difficulty and then it goes to real stammering.

181
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,660
This is the kind of stammering that Mercury can develop.

182
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:29,360
So you saw how he described it. There is something which holds me and my enemies,

183
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,120
mental, everybody is enemy, I have to protect myself.

184
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,170
This is characteristic and the aphthae is characteristic, salivation is characteristic,

185
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:46,040
everything is characteristic. It doesn’t matter now.

186
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:53,290
He can counteract the remedy by drinking coffee, whatever.

187
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,290
His remedy constantly will be Mercury.

188
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:02,890
These are of the lucky cases we said, they are going to live long. Very good.

189
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:18,240
-I think it’s rather strange that the remedy which acts so well, only acts for such a short time,

190
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:21,810
for only 21 days, if you give a 10M.

191
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:35,870
Is it either possible that the remedy was not potentized correctly or is one of the cases

192
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,720
who actually would need one dose every day.

193
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:51,210
-There are cases that they will need more frequent repetition. The remedy is clear and

194
00:24:51,310 --> 00:25:00,120
yet it doesn’t hold. Then after 5 days, you need again another dose, after 10 days, after 21 days.

195
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:05,060
He made it sound as if 21 is a magical number, which is not.

196
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,620
It’s more or less an intellectualization because the 3rd time he is taking the remedy…

197
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:18,120
I mean, it doesn’t divide from 3 the 21, from 8 months in between.

198
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:27,210
So you took 3 times the remedy, it’s not actually every 21 days.

199
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:34,460
Because from September to May is 8 months.

200
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:44,370
He took it 3 times, he repeated. So it’s not every 21 days that there is a relapse.

201
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:51,120
In the beginning it seems to. Yet it’s the same potency, which it was repeated 3rd time.

202
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:57,860
Also it’s very probable… You see all the remedies I have here are all the remedies from

203
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,210
America. I have them here, there, in my house.

204
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:12,110
You can not have unlimited number of remedies and potencies.

205
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:20,860
Here I have kept the remedies which are brought from America by an old homeopath,

206
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:28,380
who had a nice pocket and said, somebody gave it to me.

207
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:36,700
This might be the case. The potency is not strong enough.

208
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:48,300
We will see, maybe MM will be the potency for him, which will clear up the case. Maybe CM.

209
00:26:52,550 --> 00:27:00,360
The 3rd time he took it, it seems to be a better potentized 10M. From where you got this?

210
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:08,560
-From Israel.
-We will see.

211
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:15,360
At this moment of course, he has to stop putting the Sulphur.

212
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:28,600
I have seen this happening with Sulphur soaps, they can eliminate an eruption,

213
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:35,600
especially in the head very fast and of course we don’t know really whether this is a suppression.

214
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,360
How much of a suppression that can be.

215
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:46,350
Actually you have to leave it and see what happens, much longer. Because if it naturally

216
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:53,950
goes away, then naturally your body will stay free from the disturbance, as well.
