1
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:36,050
-He is now 5 years, he becomes 6 years old in November this year

2
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:43,550
and he has enuresis nocturna.

3
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:58,840
-He has what? Enuresis.

4
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:25,750
-…It comes out, I’m not sure about this, measles and after this following scarlatina

5
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,180
and it started about 2 years.

6
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:45,350
I started also in this time to work half the day and there was another person who

7
00:01:45,450 --> 00:02:03,270
was looking after him 5 hours the day. Before…

8
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,020
-During pregnancy?

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:10,780
-During pregnancy and also during the first years.

10
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:36,430
Then we discovered myopia, the right eye is not looking straight and he has myopia

11
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:49,340
the eye doctor wanted to give him a contact lens but he didn’t want to do it.

12
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:59,910
We had to hold him very strongly and after 3 times we tried to give him this lens,

13
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:15,960
he told us now we can let him and he will sit quiet and we can put this lens to his eye but

14
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,430
after this he started to stutter. After this holding he was crying first, he didn’t want to

15
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,770
get this contact lense and he started to stutter.

16
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:49,110
-They tried to put contact lens on him and he was very irritated and after this he started to stutter.

17
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:50,330
-Then he has a herpes simplex going out about after 3-4 weeks of sun and also problems and difficulties.

18
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:10,230
-Tell me what do you think about the character of this child? He is a nice child?

19
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,070
He is cute. It’s a child who creates sympathy towards him or repulsion?

20
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:29,060
-Sympathy.
-He tries to interrupt his mother.

21
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:44,400
-He tries to interrupt his mother. What it means? He has a strong character.

22
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,680
-Not shy.

23
00:05:47,780 --> 00:06:02,170
-He is not shy, no. His look is a timid child? No, he is outward.

24
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:18,360
Perhaps too much outward? We don’t know.

25
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:30,920
Enuresis, why he has enuresis? Did the mother said anything that explains the enuresis?

26
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:37,760
-She started going to work.

27
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:45,370
-Family trouble during the pregnancy and the first year. So why he has enuresis?

28
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:54,590
Because he feels insecure. There is an insecurity.

29
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:04,340
Why do we have enuresis in children? Because of insecurity, one reason and they feel

30
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:13,590
that they are not loved or they have been frightened.

31
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:24,230
-Did she not say that it only started when she went to work?

32
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:43,240
-It’s not very clear but it’s a fact that there are some family problems and the child is left

33
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,910
with another woman and there is this scarlatina which intervenes  and

34
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:55,330
as a result of this complex we have enuresis.

35
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:04,010
At the same time the mother started to work

36
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:21,370
and the child stayed in the house with another person.

37
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:27,370
That means the child was three and a half when enuresis started.

38
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:33,620
That means a reason and when I say a reason it might be the insecurity which can be

39
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:42,030
created mostly by the feeling that the child is abandoned and it’s not loved or a great

40
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:51,450
fright that can take place. This child is very much afraid for something, afraid mostly

41
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:58,280
that his life will be taken away, he will be killed and then you see the enuresis.

42
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:06,630
When the child is punished aggressively by the parents, especially the father who is more

43
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:18,370
aggressive usually and in America the mother who is more aggressive usually…

44
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,700
You are looking for troubles.

45
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,290
One of the parents can be very aggressive and can grasp the child, I’ll kill you, don’t you

46
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,640
ever do it again.

47
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:44,530
Then that shock can create enuresis. Next day enuresis can start.

48
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:57,120
Or the child may consider in his mind that I’m not loved, I’m left. Then enuresis.

49
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:03,210
And it has to have a predisposition the child towards enuresis and then this predisposition

50
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:13,870
will manifest with a provocation and the provocation can be also severe disease that it is

51
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,280
going through.

52
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,780
I think it is the same thing. It is the predisposition of the child and the child most probably

53
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,620
one way or another feels insecure and continuous. But this problem is many times

54
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:36,040
hereditary. Many times you will hear the story that the parents will say or one of the

55
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:42,040
parents, it’s the same like me until the age of 11 I had enuresis. You may hear that

56
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:56,340
usually in these kind of stories. In these kind of stories usually you will not hear that story.

57
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,250
So you can not tell me anything more about his character?

58
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,480
-No.

59
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:14,160
-Let us hear about his character a little bit.

60
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:32,440
-Sometimes he is very aggressive. For example in the table if he dislikes something,

61
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:44,300
he tries to pick with the fork or to pick the knife and should get very angry and

62
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:54,210
 then I say he has to go in the other room and just cry there and then after

63
00:11:54,310 --> 00:12:07,830
sometimes he comes from this room and he takes the sword and says I cut you in the throat.

64
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:24,210
-The mother says the child is many times aggressive. He takes something and goes into

65
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:31,550
… with the fork, the knife and the mother says, if you do that out and the child goes out

66
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:41,040
and then he comes back with a sword and says, I want to kill you now.

67
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:49,970
It gives a description of the child, this is the child. You will say, the child is playing.

68
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:55,960
Yes but another child is playing in another way, he plays in that way, if he plays and how

69
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:06,380
much he plays because in that child we will see the aggressivity developing so much and

70
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,960
so overt and outgoing the aggressivity in children. They will be very aggressive.

71
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:25,130
They will hit, very aggressive, outside aggressivity where in another remedy we’ll see an

72
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:30,790
inside aggressivity, which I have described like in Hyoscyamus, the children in

73
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:35,210
Hyoscyamus because of jealousy.

74
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:43,710
The jealousy has been so great inside them, it has killed their emotions because they can

75
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:51,550
not tolerate the suffering that the jealousy brings on. They almost stay without emotions

76
00:13:51,650 --> 00:14:02,380
in a world of madness and I have described these children how they will obey.

77
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:09,920
They will be good children, they will obey everybody but the aggressivity will come from time

78
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:16,200
to time to the extend that these children can kill somebody.

79
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:24,500
I described you in a position where there are two children playing and the one is very

80
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:32,360
jealous of the other and they are playing in the swimming pool and nobody is there.

81
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:40,250
And the one is standing in the swimming pool and Hyoscyamus will go back, will see

82
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:53,370
nobody is there and just pushes the little one into the swimming pool and then looks.

83
00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:02,170
The child of 3 years old can not save himself and Hyoscyamus will think coolly, should I save

84
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:14,880
him or not? I think he is going to be drown, I think better go to my mommy and tell her.

85
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:30,600
Mommy, I think there is a problem. But coolly, you see the emotions of the child are

86
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:40,210
terrifying inside, this child will obey, will be nice but at a certain point the aggressivity will

87
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:47,040
manifest in that cool, blooded manner.

88
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:57,350
Here the aggressivity is overt, it’s another remedy, he says I’ll kill you.

89
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:04,010
And the mother says, I smack you, throw down this, kicks first and then it throws down

90
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:19,880
and then he runs. Maybe this is the kind, we’ll hear.

91
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:26,040
He understands what she is saying.

92
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:52,610
-He is very angry. If I put him again in the room, he tries to bite me and kick me and scratch.

93
00:16:53,020 --> 00:17:03,610
-Did you hear? He will bite the mother, kick her, do something.

94
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:15,110
It is inside, the child cannot control all these reactions.

95
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:20,470
Which is the child who is behaving in this way? Let’s see more.

96
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:40,400
You see his eyes, he perceives what is going on. That now mother says

97
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:52,280
I'll get you, wait until outside.

98
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:16,420
-He had problems with his ears. He can’t hear enough for 2-3 weeks and then it goes away.

99
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:42,210
It can be only a reflection of also water, maybe.

100
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:53,000
He has fear in dark, he doesn’t like to sleep in the dark.

101
00:18:53,100 --> 00:19:02,000
-He does not like to see the dark, in the dark is not happy at all

102
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:12,610
but you see here he looks quite sweet.

103
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:26,030
-He doesn’t like to sleep alone. When his brother is not there, I have to sleep by him

104
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:37,140
because he is coming in the night and he doesn’t want to sleep.

105
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:48,970
He doesn't like to drink milk. After milk he has very soft stool.

106
00:19:49,070 --> 00:20:06,470
-After milk soft stools, diarrhea after milk you will find it.

107
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:33,890
-And he has a very [bad sound] he doesn’t get so much sleep and

108
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:46,550
 his brother is 6 years older and he has no [bad sound]

109
00:20:46,650 --> 00:21:03,050
He is a very strong [bad sound] during first sleep.

110
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:10,640
-You see how sweet, they behave very sweetly these children, they are very sympathetic

111
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:18,130
but when the time comes… they attack and they are very sympathetic children.

112
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:24,060
Usually they are the children which everybody likes, they say what a nice person until

113
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:36,050
their instinct comes and they hit and the violence appears. But it’s not constant violence.

114
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,880
Constant violence we have when this remedy develops into deep pathology and you see

115
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:53,380
very great violence. It is characteristic of these children to be sweet, to be liked, they find

116
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:08,130
a way to be liked and then suddenly they attack.

117
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:21,720
-In the kindergarten he is more big and strong and the boys are afraid of him because he

118
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:34,300
has such a strong energy to bite them and to do everything else and the children are afraid.

119
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:48,270
-All the children are afraid of him, he will hit them.

120
00:22:51,480 --> 00:23:04,070
We have to stop because I have to close the circuit.

121
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:28,730
So we continue with the case yesterday. The child is a very interesting child, a lot of energy.

122
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:33,810
These children they have a lot of energy, too much.

123
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:43,900
Tarentula children, Veratrum children, Stramonium children they have a lot of energy that

124
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:55,750
they have to spend and in a different way, the most destructive, which is destructive energy.

125
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:09,190
The most destructive are the Stramonium children. They have a lot of energy that comes

126
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:17,110
out in fits of anger and the fits are so strong and uncontrollable that they can do harm.

127
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:25,210
Even the children.

128
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:43,440
The Tarentula children can be very active in moving about, up and down, they will spend

129
00:24:43,540 --> 00:25:02,550
a lot of energy in motions and they will do all kinds of mischievous things.

130
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:13,940
The energy which comes with the Stramonium children is energy from the subconscious

131
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:20,940
I would say and unloading of the subconscious. The subconscious mind takes over,

132
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,150
they have no barriers.

133
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:36,910
The Tarentula, the energy is physical energy, they go into fights all the time, they are in a

134
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:43,490
state of tremendous energy which is produced and it has to be spent all the time.

135
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:51,820
The Stramonium children are not like that. Energy is produced in fits and then seduced.

136
00:25:51,920 --> 00:26:02,410
They may even go to sleep, when they sit down without doing anything, they go like that.

137
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:10,660
They can be very passive, you think they are very passive, the Stramonium.

138
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,160
The fit comes… passive.

139
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:20,650
Tarentula a lot of physical energy, energy which is coming all the time, it is like

140
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,700
burning up energy, inside.

141
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:35,080
With the Veratrum, the energy is mental. It is as if there is a lot of mental energy,

142
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:46,970
a lot of thinking. It is also a kind of restlessness but the energy will be on a mental level.

143
00:26:47,070 --> 00:27:02,260
Thinking all the time and thinking which is not productive, thinking…

144
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:11,840
if they are in a position to think because later on in pathology they become completely...

145
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:19,750
If you see artistic children who are Veratrum, then the energy is not so much mental anymore

146
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:27,070
but it becomes also physical and there is a lot of action and they want to keep busy

147
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:38,070
with something, which has no meaning but they want to keep busy with something.

148
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:54,490
The Stramonium is frightful to look upon during the crisis while they are very cute children

149
00:27:54,590 --> 00:28:10,530
when they are out of crisis, cute, nice, sweet. You won’t believe.

150
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:16,000
In our books we describe all this violence of Stramonium and then somebody comes to

151
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:21,750
your office, sits there, he is so nice and he says, how can I give Stramonium?

152
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:33,830
He is so nice and in the book what I’ve read is blah, blah… I’m giving you the real picture.

153
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:42,910
For instance, in the consulting room the Stramonium will move very little, like this child.

154
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:49,410
We have some kind of restlessness. If that was a Tarentula or a Veratrum would go all

155
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:57,830
about like a machine; mostly Tarentula but the Stramonium a little bit of restlessness or

156
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,750
no restlessness at all.

157
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:15,830
Sometimes when they sit there in the chair, they will sleep in the chair in the consultation room.

158
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:34,680
But when the crisis comes, you see no control, they become another person all together.

159
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:42,900
And Stramonium children sometimes will be very sweet all day, never aggressive,

160
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:51,430
the parents will describe them as very passive children, nice children, with no real problems.

161
00:29:51,530 --> 00:30:02,020
Maybe they will just urinate during the night but the aggressiveness will come out during sleep,

162
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,370
the subconscious will take over them during sleep.

163
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:15,690
During that time, they wake up every night almost, with frightful images, frightful dreams

164
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:25,190
and they wake up and they are voiceless and you see their eyes full of fright.

165
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:36,110
And they stare and they scream and you say, I’m here what happened? You are there

166
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:45,020
and they keep on looking. They look an image, which is in the dream and continues,

167
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:53,910
while you think that the child has opened his eyes. They do not see the reality.

168
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:58,100
They see what is in their subconscious. What is in their subconscious?

169
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,020
The fears that have been created due to stresses. You will tell me the stress is enough

170
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,990
to produce a Stramonium child?

171
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:17,440
Sometimes if the stress is a lot, it can produce, just by the stress without the child being

172
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:26,900
really Stramonium child. You give a tremendous fright to a child and in the night, it wakes

173
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,520
up terrified, seeing monsters, seeing snakes, seeing people that come to get it, if they

174
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:43,240
can describe, usually they don’t remember but that remains all the time until they are

175
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:52,420
pacified and they go back to sleep. They do not really come out of that state.

176
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:01,070
This kind of description, if the parents will give it to you, even if the child is very nice, very sweet...

177
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:10,960
These children have no problem during the day.

178
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:19,910
Such children, as I said, can become Stramonium because of fright. The other children

179
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:26,410
that are Stramonium they need a little bit of fright, they do not need very much, they just

180
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:35,530
need a slap one time, they wake up or they see some frightful things, they observe

181
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:44,740
outside in their environment. The father grabs the mother and the child gets the fright.

182
00:32:44,840 --> 00:33:00,330
From that moment onwards, you may have the ignition of the situation.

183
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:10,910
To ignite something is to start fire.

184
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:19,820
It is an interesting thing also to observe in Stramonium children, that we are talking about

185
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:33,260
in this case, it’s very interesting for me when I realized it eventually, that they have a kind

186
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:50,330
of meditative mood and also some kind of, when a child maybe understands more than you.

187
00:33:50,430 --> 00:34:03,610
You know these children? They don’t talk, they stay serious and maybe he understands more than me.

188
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:12,590
They give you that impression.

189
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:23,360
With Tarentula is another thing all together. Yes, its’ aggressive also.

190
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:30,990
With Hyoscyamus, I talked to you about one state of Hyoscyamus yesterday.

191
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:38,240
It’s not all the Hyoscyamus children they reach that end stage, this is quite deep stage when

192
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:50,240
 they remain without emotions, cool. There is another stage where they are quite violent,

193
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:58,160
expressing violence as well the Hyoscyamus children but not to that extend that

194
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,990
we have been talking about.

195
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:11,270
With Stramonium they express anger, they express jealousy and there is a tendency to

196
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:19,910
strike, a desire to hit. With Hyoscyamus we don’t see the realization of the desire, as

197
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,410
much as we see the desire. You see the difference?

198
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:31,140
The organism does not have the energy really to come up and really strike.

199
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:38,480
Where Stramonium when the impulse to strike comes up, nobody can stop him.

200
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:43,470
It’s the same thing with grown ups,, they have to put them on a straight jacket.

201
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:51,980
Otherwise they will hit a lot of people. The energy is aroused and the energy is aroused

202
00:35:52,080 --> 00:36:00,320
in all mental cases but mostly when we have Tarentula, Hyoscyamus, Stramonium, in

203
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:14,570
these cases, mostly Tarentula. The Tarentula has tremendous power which overcomes…

204
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:28,310
I remember a case, he was a man working for a bank, the Bank of Greece and you know

205
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:33,020
in the bank there are offices all over the place.

206
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:39,980
If somebody on the fourth office had or he thinks he had insulted him, he said I did not

207
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:47,480
have the time to go through the corridor and find him. I would jump over 1,2,3 and grab

208
00:36:47,580 --> 00:37:05,900
him and say, what did you say? The power when you see it, that kind of thing.

209
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:15,350
He was supposed to be a sane man living in the society among others but nobody dared

210
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:25,900
to insult him after a certain period of time. After Tarentula he says, I can’t believe it,

211
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:35,910
they make jokes and he says, I don’t react, what has happened to me?

212
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:46,180
There are so many facets.

213
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:52,310
What I try to give you is main ideas that run through the remedies.

214
00:37:52,410 --> 00:38:01,430
And if you get these ideas, then you recognize but it is not possible for me to give you all

215
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:09,720
the possible modifications of all the remedies in every situation, neither I can remember of course.

216
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:17,090
The only thing that remembers is this bloody machine that we are involved now.

217
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:25,380
Let’s see a little bit of that.

218
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:44,030
-He can also [bad sound]…

219
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:50,040
-You see how sweet he is?

220
00:38:50,140 --> 00:39:02,700
Sit down. Sit there.

221
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:10,620
You try to aggravate them, you can not aggravate them. You shout, the time has not come.

222
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:17,650
If the time comes, you don’t have to aggravate them, they just jump and they hit you,

223
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:24,380
nevermind what. You don’t have to shout, you just have to look at them and they look

224
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,540
at you and you understand they are coming, the instinct is coming, you feel it. I’ve been

225
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:37,790
hit by children like that. I came to the house and they hold the mother and they look and

226
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:51,430
then suddenly they surround and hit. Then I played games, I pretended nothing

227
00:39:51,530 --> 00:40:01,170
happened to see how it will go about, it won’t pacify them. If you go against them, they

228
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:09,510
will attack again, if you are very calm, it doesn’t matter until the crisis is over, until what is

229
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,670
inside is finished.

230
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:23,860
You see now? I shout at him, he is very nice. He will sit there.

231
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:46,510
I can’t speak his language.

232
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:56,680
It’s OK, let him fight.

233
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:03,760
Enough, sit down.

234
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:21,670
You see how lovable they can be? They are affectionate, very sweet until their time.

235
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,430
-Is he crying?

236
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:31,180
-He pretends he is crying.

237
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:48,920
Sit down. I will smack you.

238
00:41:51,350 --> 00:42:05,760
-He doesn’t want you to see him crying.

239
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:29,260
-Why? He is looking nice when he is crying? He is very cute.

240
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:39,440
You are very lucky.

241
00:42:49,060 --> 00:43:14,300
Sit down there. You understand what I said?

242
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:29,750
[Bad sound]

243
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:42,680
You are angry?
-Yes.

244
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:48,760
-You want to hit me?
-Yes.

245
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,720
-Try and see what happens. I hit you back.
-Yes.

246
00:43:52,820 --> 00:44:05,720
-Sit there, good boys sit there. You will sit, I’m telling you.

247
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:12,970
-No.

248
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:33,690
-Why?
-Because he wants to have…[bad sound]

249
00:44:35,940 --> 00:45:15,720
-You lie to me.
-He wants to go out.

250
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:24,130
-Why?
-He forgot his bread.

251
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:35,380
-And he wants to go out, just now he remembered his bread?

252
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:40,120
-OK go and get your bread.

253
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:45,160
You see if I had managed to irritate him, he would immediately go and hit his mother.

254
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:53,410
Maybe he would not hit me but he would go to his mother but it’s not his time.

255
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:57,750
It’s the sweet time for Stramonium.

256
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:05,170
They understand very well, they have a perception because they have strong feelings

257
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:13,080
they perceive very easily what is taking place around them.

258
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:23,440
He perceives that I changed, never mind I shout, he knows I’m playing, he doesn’t take me seriously anymore.

259
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:35,680
In the beginning he was not certain, he almost made a mistake.

260
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:42,690
-OK go and get your bread.

261
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:54,850
-I have to go with him.

262
00:46:54,950 --> 00:47:07,270
You see this child looks like Baryta carbonica. He holds his mother, he doesn’t look, he is shy,

263
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:13,350
you can make a story if you don’t know the real picture.

264
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:21,460
The Stramonium can be affectionate, can be sweet. You make it as a Baryta carbonica child.

265
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:27,540
The Baryta carbonica child will sit exactly like he sits, it is a grown up child,

266
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,410
he will hold his mother and he will not look at you.

267
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:48,620
That’s the main features for Baryta carbonica but Baryta carbonica will never be violent.

268
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:17,480
-Is he afraid of animals, dogs?

269
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:21,440
-No, if they bite him yes.

270
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:25,100
-He likes to swim in the sea?

271
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:38,770
-He likes but he is also afraid to go into the deep water. He can’t stay.

272
00:48:38,870 --> 00:48:44,940
-How is his sleep?
-He sleeps well.

273
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,720
-He is not restless when he sleep?
-No.

274
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:55,310
-He doesn’t wake up in a nightmare, shouting, screaming?

275
00:48:55,410 --> 00:49:02,440
-Not very often. In this time, these 5 weeks, he was crying.

276
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:08,350
-Have you ever you or your husband frightened him?

277
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:11,390
-Yes.

278
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,890
-What he did?

279
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:26,270
-He told to my husband please stop now and he comes to me.

280
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:30,550
-He is more attached to you?
-Yes.

281
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:37,530
There is another point with Stramonium that you have to know.

282
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:47,140
Imbalance in the human body goes up and down. It can change levels.

283
00:49:47,240 --> 00:50:01,020
When you see that same child can become quite controlled in his behavior and then you

284
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:06,890
may start seeing the disturbance on a more peripheral level in the nervous system and

285
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:19,780
you will see grimaces, different kind of grimaces and the child is normal emotionally.

286
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:32,530
But all the time, what is this?

287
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:46,850
Like Agaricus also, it’s similar. It is more aggressive.

288
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:53,860
Stramonium is… I can’t reproduce everything.

289
00:50:53,960 --> 00:51:12,030
Different ticks, quite strong, quite frequent and eventually you may see movements

290
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:19,020
where the whole nervous system is involved like choreic movements, not chorea.

291
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:24,780
You can see chorea as well but before he reaches chorea state, just the previous stages,

292
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,950
if you can imagine.

293
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:33,690
-More in the adults?

294
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:40,730
-More in the adults but in the children also.

295
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:52,780
Especially when they are real Stramonium children and they have a severe fright.

296
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:58,530
I had seen a child, I had seen the scene in front of me, it took place when the father

297
00:51:58,630 --> 00:52:04,270
grabbed the child because it was not listening. Come here, no. Come here, no.

298
00:52:04,370 --> 02:00:28,520
Come here now. No, I will not come. The father grabs the child…
