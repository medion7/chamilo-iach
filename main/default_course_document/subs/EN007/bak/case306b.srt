1
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:59,000
We start to analyze this very easy case.

2
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,450
Is this a case of Phosphorus?

3
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,960
-No.

4
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:18,170
-But Phosp. they say it’s doing something. In the groups here, where you will place this

5
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:25,340
case, in which group?

6
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:54,320
Who says lowest 3? Who says middle 3? Who says upper 3? Who says upper 4?

7
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:10,820
Who says middle 4? It’s middle 4. If anybody can cure this case, come and tell me.

8
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,080
Incurable.

9
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:28,270
Group middle 4, incurable. We can do nothing, very little but it will stay like this, the best.

10
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:35,980
-It’s already a good sign if it would be possible to keep the units of insulin he has to take

11
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:43,230
stable for a certain amount of years, which will enable him to maintain his life quality over

12
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,980
a number of years.

13
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,900
-But this is what is going to stay. This is as far as we can go. When he comes on that

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:03,290
state, we cannot do very much. From 14 to 10, then again 12 to 15, then 16, then back.

15
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:16,040
This kind of reaction you are going to see, why?

16
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:23,040
Is the remedy clear in this case?

17
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:31,050
-For me this case taking the remedy is clear. In the very beginning he said something.

18
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:37,290
He very much loves animals, he is a nice child, always very obedient, even when he

19
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:45,040
plays outside, he immediately comes in when his mother calls him. The father himself

20
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,290
has diabetes and I would give the child Carcinosin.

21
00:03:51,390 --> 00:04:03,550
-The problem is, is this clear enough? If we had a history of cancer, strong history we

22
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:10,130
could say… The love of animals also in children you don’t take it as a symptom unless

23
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:19,050
it’s very strong. Love of animals is OK, most of the children they love animals.

24
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:30,270
-I heard from Geukens School, a study of Carcinosin, that the history of diabetes also leads to

25
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,780
Carcinosin, not only the history of cancer.

26
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:42,270
-Yes, that is true but again the reading in children where they are handicapped is an

27
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:51,770
outlet. Therefore, because they feel handicapped, they go into reading much more.

28
00:04:51,870 --> 00:05:13,020
What do you read, I insisted. Comics. Not something serious, not something where we

29
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:26,300
usual. Maybe he likes mathematics.

30
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:35,800
Anyhow also the computer comes up very strongly with Carcinosin and we’re going finally

31
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:53,550
to prescribe Carcinosin in this case and you will see the results, very poor.

32
00:05:53,650 --> 00:06:09,550
Show me the analysis. Carcinosin and Pulsatilla come quite strong, give explanation for

33
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:38,990
Pulsatilla. Show me Carcinosin.

34
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,470
-Obedient?

35
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:51,190
-Obedient is an element of Carcinosin when the child tries to please others. They go

36
00:06:51,290 --> 00:07:02,950
beyond their limits to please others, to please the parents, they try to be loved, to have

37
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:16,950
affection through this kind of being good.

38
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,200
Which other remedies you were thinking in this case?

39
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,650
-Uranium nitricum.

40
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:38,870
-Uranium nitricum is a remedy for diabetes, just on pathology.

41
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:51,120
This case is like autistic children, a part of the brain is gone, it is considered as non

42
00:07:51,220 --> 00:08:00,440
existent, like a kidney which is totally destroyed and is taken out. It’s totally gone and this

43
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:15,890
you can not consider it as disease. With disease we have a process. A disease has a

44
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:23,340
kind of inflammation, chronic or acute. It’s a process, it’s something happening all the

45
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:36,300
time. In these cases we have destruction and it’s finished and then another piece is

46
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:47,550
destructed and it’s finished. You can do nothing. Of course if you catch it in the very

47
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:58,550
beginning, you may stop the initial destruction, you may stop it in the beginning.

48
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:09,050
In that state, no. But what made me a little bit angry was the fact that we could not get

49
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:20,780
symptoms from the mother. Whatever we asked, she did not know anything and you see

50
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:31,660
also that in incurable cases we don’t have symptoms. Never mind, here we have a nice

51
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:40,760
boy and we give Carcinosin, this is actually the case and maybe something will happen

52
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,430
not much.

53
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:55,100
Now if this case had given us strong symptoms of a remedy, I would say the prognosis

54
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:08,090
is perhaps different, is perhaps lower 3, I would agree. When you come to this level

55
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:17,400
different remedies will be required. Phosphorus, every time his nose is open, this is

56
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:25,660
characteristic of Phosphorus. Phos. is acting, is giving some effect, it does not give a

57
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,900
cure, we do not have the possibility with Homeopathy.

58
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,910
-I have some problems assessing the action of Phos. The mother had reported that the

59
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:44,910
blood sugar level did go lower, after applying Phos. the only remedy which has this effect

60
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,900
and it’s the chronicity of this disease, so why not repeat Phos?

61
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,150
-Because she has repeated it too many times, the mother has repeated Phos too many

62
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:05,400
times, so we consider at this moment that Phos has done all it could, keeping that boy in

63
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:17,900
that “good condition” in which he is now. We try now to see whether we can stimulate the

64
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,610
vital force, the defense mechanism by a next remedy. It is not sure at all that it will give an

65
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:33,530
effect, that’s what I say.

66
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:39,030
-Is it not possible that the mother maybe chose the wrong potency that did not have

67
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,780
enough stimulation?

68
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:52,020
-Yes that’s possible but also I’m hearing that the child is bleeding very easily now.

69
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:59,190
So how much is because of too much Phos also, I have to think about that.

70
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:05,660
-I have 1 question in general about diabetes. Before, you said if he would had showed

71
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,610
clear symptoms for a remedy, then you would have given a different prognosis.

72
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,610
Have you ever in your experience seen a case of juvenile diabetes being cured by

73
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,560
Homeopathy?

74
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:28,280
-No, but all the cases of juvenile diabetes have the same picture, no clear picture.

75
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:34,670
You search and you find this, some effect, you find another, another effect, you give the

76
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:46,670
3rd, the 4th gives nothing, you go to a 5th, again a little bit of effect, it’s going like that.

77
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:54,670
And it is important also you understand these issues and we don’t go outside in the world

78
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:05,410
and we claim things we can not deliver. Because even if 1 case of juvenile diabetes

79
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:14,660
maybe it’s cured, it is because that particular case belongs to group 3.

80
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,620
But usually they belong to group 4.

81
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:26,860
So you have the same pathology but actually it is not the same, the underlined possibility

82
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:38,580
of the organism is different and sometimes you may see, I haven’t seen cure and when I

83
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:46,250
say cure, I mean cure, I don’t mean less insulin.

84
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,280
-What do you tell the mother in such a case?

85
00:13:51,380 --> 00:14:01,040
-I’ll tell the mother that we can not cure the child but we will try to keep the child in the best

86
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:11,460
possible condition; that we can do, with good Homeopathy but to tell, come, I may treat

87
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:20,960
and I may cure is wrong.

88
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,990
-My question is concerning the prognosis. Would the prognosis have been better, would

89
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:31,380
have been easier if this child had not had already a genetic determination of the diabetes

90
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,570
of his father?

91
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:45,550
-Maybe yes but when his father has already the problem and you see it in the child

92
00:14:45,650 --> 00:15:03,210
you can’t say, forget it. Especially when you don’t get a clear picture, no symptoms.

93
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:11,120
This child is free of symptoms. Never mind, you like chocolate, you like the animals, all

94
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:25,880
these is a little bit of nonsense in cases like that. Let this insulin out and you will see a

95
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,130
totally different picture, it doesn’t like animals, it doesn’t care about chocolate, he just

96
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:38,630
lies down in a semi-coma condition. Where is the picture? We don’t have the picture to

97
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:50,380
work with. The real picture of the disease is covered by the supplement of insulin.

98
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,120
You say nice child, forget it. Take out the insulin and you will see how nice it is and how

99
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:03,040
much irritable it might be, it might be shouting etc. a totally different picture.

100
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:12,460
Now what we do? We stimulate and maybe hoping we arrive at a remedy picture without

101
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,460
having the terrible situation of taking out all together the insulin, finding out what is

102
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,710
happening really.

103
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,460
And how high it can reach also.

104
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:35,430
-If you would take away the insulin, you would get a clear picture?

105
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:42,620
-Yes but who dares to take out the insulin, you see you are criminal if you do it.

106
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,870
-But then could you cure the child?

107
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:55,370
-I say no. There is a possibility more than it is now. Now there is no possibility.

108
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:11,300
Then it might be 1% possibility, for 1% you leave the child in a coma state?

109
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,690
You see the same problem that we have with cortisone, with the girl. The girl under

110
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:25,690
cortisone presents a totally different picture than the one really is there, as a pure disease

111
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:42,680
state. We don’t know, so we search and we try.

112
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:53,180
Also not to be mislead by little symptomatology in things like that. You have to have

113
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:01,930
symptoms where you base your prescription really, on the ground. Here most of the

114
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:13,200
symptoms are projections. You don’t know. I will give you an example.

115
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:20,960
Can you understand the psychology of a child who feels that is dependant on some

116
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:35,130
medication? The psychology will be to be aggressive or to be very nice to those from

117
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:48,800
whom he depends on? So how is that a symptom or a side effect of his condition?

118
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,560
You don’t know, it might be a symptom or it might be a dependence because of the

119
00:18:53,660 --> 00:19:11,300
condition. So all these questions come to my mind when I take such a case.

120
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:25,950
Whenever I have tried remedies, pathology wise, Uran- n., Jab., Phos-ac, Nat-s.

121
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:34,820
the best remedy for me for diabetes is Nat. sulp. out of all these, if you want a remedy

122
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:44,860
but it will not work in this case. Give it in this case, nothing. Give all the remedies together

123
00:19:44,960 --> 00:20:02,620
it will bring down perhaps for 3 months, then the 4th month you see it up again.

124
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:10,860
It’s a good teaching from one point of view.

125
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,360
-What you are saying is actually that this juvenile diabetes is not a disease but an end

126
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,860
stage.

127
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,120
-Yes, it’s an end stage.

128
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,400
-And this is its manifestation, there is no dynamic here.

129
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:35,370
-Yes.

130
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:43,610
That’s why you will see in such cases, for instance you get these children what we call

131
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:50,070
mongoloid children, the Down syndrome, whatever you call it; you will see in these

132
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:58,540
children though they belong in group 4, that means incurable, you can not make a

133
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:08,530
mongoloid child, a normal child. Though it belongs to group 4 it is a class of diseases

134
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:13,530
which I did not talk because I do not want, perhaps it’s too much.

135
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:22,570
Once you have a total destruction of an organ, then you don’t have a disease anymore.

136
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:31,280
You have a stabilized case and the chronic inflammation process is not there anymore.

137
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:43,280
Therefore acute diseases may manifest, the chronic infection does not prevent the

138
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:55,780
organism from manifesting acute conditions. Take a kidney which is in the process of

139
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:11,540
destruction and you will see the stoppage of acute conditions in a nephritic syndrome.

140
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:21,780
Let’s take the end stage where the kidney is gone and you take it out and the

141
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:31,740
inflammation stops, the chronic inflammation condition is stopped.

142
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:44,370
Then you may see again acutes returning.

143
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:52,110
It is the same idea which Hahnemann was talking when he was saying, you can not have

144
00:22:52,210 --> 00:23:04,830
two diseases at the same time. If there is one disease process, but we confuse disease

145
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:26,750
with end stages, where it is finished the organ, the thyroid is finished, they take it out and

146
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:36,500
you may see again some acutes coming up. But while the thyroid is in the process of

147
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:47,000
degeneration, then you will see the minimizing of acute conditions. In the Down

148
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:54,000
syndrome the mongoloid children many times you get these children who are very

149
00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:11,990
sensitive to acutes. They get frequent acutes. This is the reason.

150
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,950
-In a sense they return to level 1?

151
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:26,910
-No to level 1. They go up a little bit, to level 3 perhaps where they have acutes which are

152
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:32,670
not severe that kind.

153
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:41,620
An organism who becomes strong, get the idea of children. The children if they get a

154
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:50,950
fever is 40-41 degrees, the organism is still strong, then they throw out the disease in a

155
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:57,950
forceful manner. You get this slowly down the organism and then you get less and less

156
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:13,780
reaction, the fever becomes less, finally it doesn’t manifest at all.

157
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,290
We discussed the child, we said we give Carcinosin. Now the mother comes and says

158
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:29,560
the child had some symptoms. Margaret said the child has some strong symptoms and

159
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:32,070
she reads these symptoms now for the child.

160
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:40,030
-This is what the mother told me. She said since childhood the child has strong desire for

161
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:52,130
ice cream, even when he couldn’t not talk yet and he always cried while he was eating

162
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:57,140
the ice cream and the mother’s first thought is in the stomach but when he could talk he

163
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,890
said he has a pain in his head. In spite of having this pain, he still eats ice cream. It’s a

164
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:11,890
real strong for ice cream. Another strong desire is cucumber, he loves to eat cucumber.

165
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,990
-Now?

166
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:26,880
-Always. He eats cucumber and that he can not tolerate cold on his feet and that he gets

167
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:37,380
throat problems. If it’s raining he gets throat problems also. The nose bleeding he has

168
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:43,330
since he was a very small child, since 2 years or so and this is why the mother gave him

169
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,310
Phos.

170
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,500
-But still he is bleeding a lot.

171
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:59,720
-Yes but the last Phos was 2 years ago.

172
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,470
-The mother is here. The last Phos was 2 years ago? But you said you gave Phos for

173
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:12,470
something recently.

174
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:24,720
-It was 3 years ago he had Phos but I had given him a year ago 30D when he had throat

175
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,420
problems. Only once.

176
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,580
-The last Phos was 1 year ago?

177
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,050
-Yes.

178
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:41,720
-And he drinks a lot, 3 lit the day.

179
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,470
-It needs to be cold?

180
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:48,390
-Look this is what I want to tell you, in Norway they don’t put ice in water because it is

181
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:53,130
already ice cold from the tap, so he drinks water from the tap

182
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,890
-Accepted.

183
00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:04,830
-And he was tested this winter and he still has some insulin production himself.

184
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:29,300
Skin in hands and toes falls off and he got Carcinosin in August 30D, 2 times.

185
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,060
-Why you did not write it in your report?

186
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:44,560
-Because I was little afraid. When he got the Carcinosin, he go very high and very low

187
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:55,630
from 20 to 2 and when he goes so low, he doesn’t feel himself. And I was afraid of

188
00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:01,360
stressing him with this.

189
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:03,360
-I didn’t understand.

190
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:14,110
-After Carcinosin the blood sugar jumped up and down from 2 to 20 and I was afraid.

191
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:21,370
-Which is the normal?

192
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:28,870
-That’s another unit and I think the normal value is about 5.

193
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:39,360
-OK give me this scale now. 5 equals to the previous scale to what?

194
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:44,170
-The similarity between the milimole and the milligrams.

195
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:55,080
-5 milimole is about 80 milligrams approximately.

196
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:00,700
-And level 2 what she says is less than 80?

197
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:14,170
-It’s less than 80. It’s about 30 I think, it’s a hypoglycemia.

198
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:23,920
-That means that under Carcinosin the insulin should have been reduced. That is what

199
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:31,330
it shows here. Do you understand?

200
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:37,020
-But George she was saying that it was swinging around. It was going up to 20.

201
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,070
-Yes it may swing from here and the third days yes of course it may go up there because

202
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:48,880
here they say, eat pasta.

203
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,880
-It was not the third day, the same day.

204
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:56,380
-Without eating sweet?

205
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,380
-With the same as usual, it went down to 2 and then up to 20.

206
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:18,130
-I don’t believe that. It can not come from 30… Under normal diet suddenly to go up.

207
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:27,620
When it’s very low, that means people will eat a little bit more sweets, pasta, whatever

208
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,630
and then it comes up.

209
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:43,160
-George sometimes it happens for no apparent reason, diabetics can be very odd.

210
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:56,240
-Such differences? From 2 to 20?

211
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:13,290
-Yes it can happen, they call it the somogyi  effect, you see it in diabetes often especially in

212
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,270
children juvenile diabetes.

213
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:25,740
-Now never comes down again to that 3? Only under Carcinosin this happened?

214
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,480
-Yes.

215
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:34,990
-Never again?

216
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:43,240
I could only imagine that Carcinosin may have acted and he did not need this. The other

217
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:51,490
thing I don’t know, I have never seen it myself but under Carcinosin it goes like this down

218
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:56,240
that means you have to cut down the insulin.

219
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:16,810
-But himself when he is about 4 or 5, he notices it himself and he takes some sweets.

220
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:28,660
When he is about 3,5 but this time he didn’t notice because it went so fast down and he went

221
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:41,590
to bed and cried and after he couldn’t remember anything about it. Therefore I’m afraid to

222
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:51,080
give him this because I’m afraid it could happen with a regulation.

223
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:56,570
-I hope somebody who knows what he is doing is taking care of the regulation of the

224
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:06,070
insulin. When we treat either the thyroid or the pancreas with the homeopathic remedy

225
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:11,770
and there is a supply with the organ, whatever it might be, we have always to check and

226
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:20,740
regulate the intake of thyroxin or insulin in order not to have some kind of accident.

227
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:30,490
Because yes under homeopathic remedy it might be a drop, that’s a fact. Then you have

228
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:37,750
to check it and withdraw the intake of insulin.

229
00:34:37,850 --> 00:35:00,080
-He checks 4-5 times the day. Very often.

230
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:09,330
Anyhow, find me the symptom.

231
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:21,830
-I want to say one more thing. It’s not a fissure, it was a fistula in the rectum which was

232
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:28,820
operated.

233
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:41,570
-Find me the rubric headache from eating ice-cream, you will see Phos is not there.

234
00:35:41,670 --> 00:36:00,660
It’s another remedy, Pulsatilla is strong for that symptom, you have to remember.

235
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:09,410
Therefore the child will need Pulsatilla, Sulphur or Carcinosin? Now we have all the

236
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:16,410
information, Carcin. did this, Puls. did that and Phos. did this.

237
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:31,580
He never took Pulsatilla OK. Continue with Phos?

238
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,280
-With a heavy thirst.

239
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:53,570
-With a heavy thirst, desires ice cream strong. The cucumber is interesting for me.

240
00:36:53,670 --> 00:37:09,490
Give him first Phos 200, first.

241
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:13,160
I have added Phos

242
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,900
-Interesting.

243
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:31,900
-Give him first Phos 200. If you see a real effect on the blood sugar, drop the units a

244
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:45,910
little bit and then continue checking, the first few days are very important and then we see

245
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:53,160
if there is no effect, then we go to Carcinosin 200 and you do the same. You understand?

246
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,410
Very good.

247
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:02,020
-One question very short. I remember that Mr. Geukens published that Puls can be very thirsty

248
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,740
 and the thirst of this child is very great.

249
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:14,480
-Yes we have Puls, it is a possibility later on, we have it but not yet.

250
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,980
-I want to say one more thing. I understand very well why the mother is so anxious about

251
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,480
this because really this is a life threatening situation, the blood sugar goes down to 2 or

252
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:30,730
even lower and I could imagine that this Carc because it acts so strongly. But then she

253
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:39,230
should have a clinical possibility really to check the child to put a needle here with

254
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:44,500
glucose, she really needs a doctor who works with her.

255
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,230
-But I believe she knows because in all these cases the mothers become nurses or

256
00:38:49,330 --> 00:39:00,230
doctors and they know exactly what they are doing. They can handle really the situation.

257
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:09,480
But what you say is correct, I say the same thing. When you present yourselves here I

258
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:16,480
consider that you understand enough medicine so I don’t have to give you advice on that

259
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:27,480
level as well. On top of that I’m not a specialist on allopathic medicine.

260
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:37,980
The boy with insulin first, I want to show you the mother has given some feedback

261
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:44,730
concerning the boy after Phos.

262
00:39:44,830 --> 00:40:05,260
The amount of insulin he was taking before, the units are 18-20. The day he took the

263
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:36,480
Phos 200 he needed 48, it doubled the amount and the levels were up to 19 here and

264
00:40:36,580 --> 00:41:03,480
next day he needed 47, more than double and the level went up to 23. The third day

265
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:28,750
44 with level 23, highest level 23 again. Today she said the levels are quite high all of

266
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:37,230
them, here they are quite high all the levels where the first and second day were up and

267
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:55,730
down.

268
00:41:55,830 --> 00:42:13,220
So far he had taken 20 units, she says it’s going to be more than double until the night.

269
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:34,650
There is definitely an aggravation. The question is after this aggravation, shall we have

270
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:52,390
an amelioration? The mother also now gives a list of symptoms that she says is a new list

271
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:57,400
of symptoms.

272
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:10,560
It was late talking, then suddenly he spoke only words, he has perspiration in the night.

273
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:48,560
Drinks a lot, liked milk but not anymore, desire smoked meat, likes sweet and ice cream

274
00:43:48,660 --> 00:44:08,230
feels restless with stiff pains under heels after exertion, likes the animals, he is

275
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:27,590
sympathetic, doesn’t cry easily, if things are bad he gets tears in his eyes without crying

276
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:35,680
ear ache.

277
00:44:35,780 --> 00:45:02,930
-The last 2 months he has got moles.

278
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:09,430
-Very interesting this information, in the last 2 months out of all that what is more

279
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:32,420
important is that he got a lot of moles.

280
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:42,670
He does not like to be in boat and the waves, easily throat problems, perspire feet and

281
00:45:42,770 --> 00:46:00,510
forehead, aggravates by cold and wet, awkward he easily falls, stumbles, loses glasses

282
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:07,760
can not talk about troubles, gets tears in his eyes but can not tell anything, wake up with

283
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:30,560
pain in the neck. The mother said this is a picture of Nat. mur. maybe.

284
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:45,810
You persuaded me instead of Cancerinum to give Phosphorus. Now?

285
00:46:45,910 --> 00:47:02,240
Manipulation. I feel sorry I did not give Cancerinum.

286
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:07,990
-The difficulty was that on the paper she had, she said he desires smoked meat, then I

287
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:12,240
put it in the computer and then you asked the boy and he said no. Then I took it out again

288
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:16,000
so what is it now, is he desiring smoked meat or not?

289
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:21,740
-He has a desire?

290
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:43,930
-Yes, yes he didn’t say no. Fish too. He loves bacon and eggs.

291
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:48,420
-But smoked meat is different than bacon and eggs.

292
00:47:48,520 --> 00:48:00,940
-But also smoked meat and fish.

293
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:11,180
-Anyhow this is not so important, unless it was very, very strong. Desires salt? He takes

294
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,180
the salt and put salt on his food?

295
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:23,690
-No, he likes potato chips and so on but he only takes salt on eggs.

296
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:25,220
-Who doesn’t eat potato chips?

297
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,710
-But he loves it.

298
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:41,680
-Is anybody who does not eat potato chips? There are 2 people in the class.

299
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:49,110
If you don’t eat potato chips maybe it’s a symptom because you don’t like salt, then you

300
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:55,520
don’t like salt.

301
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:05,780
My first student, a woman doctor she never drank coca-cola, so I could not find the

302
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:13,780
symptom anywhere, aversion to coca-cola. Then I enquire into the issue of not liking

303
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:23,020
coca-cola, what she does not like? She says, it’s an American product!

304
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:36,970
I’m talking back to 67, she says, this is an American product, I never touch it, so there is

305
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:42,770
different ways of not liking potato chips because if you are health conscious, you don’t

306
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:57,260
take potato chips. There are different ways that people think, so you have to enquire.

307
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:09,470
What shall we do now? These are the problems that you are going to face when you

308
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:25,840
undertake such cases.

309
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:30,850
-I think we have to wait a little more.

310
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:36,100
-Did anything else change? Any other symptoms except from the blood sugar do we have

311
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,350
any special symptoms?

312
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:45,600
-The mother says, there was an aggravation where the boy became very restless, the

313
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:58,590
whole night was turning, that was there 2 nights and the third night he slept on his right

314
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:02,350
side. Is this correct?

315
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,100
-Yes.

316
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,840
-What else?

317
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:13,020
-Nothing else, the first day he was very tired but now he is not so tired even he is very

318
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:24,510
high blood sugar. I think the blood sugar is very high, it’s difficult for me to get it down.

319
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:27,900
It’s too high now these 2 days.

320
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,850
-Today especially?

321
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:39,600
-And yesterday but today he has only eaten once and he maybe another day had taken

322
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:58,850
6-8 units, now he has taken 22.

323
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:04,520
-I would rather suggest that the boy again takes the history together with another

324
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:10,290
Norwegian doctor who translates so that the boy can talk Norwegian and the doctor will

325
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:24,520
translate it in both languages to and from, so that we really get the case.

326
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:37,520
-In Norwegian and then translate?

327
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:40,720
-I don’t think he will say so much more.

328
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:44,680
-That’s my opinion also.

329
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:58,370
-I have been to doctor with him before in Norway and he doesn’t say a lot.

330
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:05,120
-Is he really a nice boy? That means whatever you tell him, he will do?

331
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,910
-Yes.

332
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:24,870
-Give him Staphysagria. Why he does that? He wants to please you, what do you think?

333
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:27,870
Always his character was like that?

334
00:53:27,970 --> 00:54:04,210
-Yes but he can joke and he can do such things but he is nice. He can tease the children.

335
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:12,700
He can do something wrong. Yes he can.

336
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:20,710
-If he gets upset, what he does?

337
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:24,690
-He gets to his room and shut the door.

338
00:54:24,790 --> 00:54:28,700
-How long does he stay?

339
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,950
-1 hour or so and he won’t talk about it.

340
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:34,440
-Does he cry?

341
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,700
-No.

342
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,440
-Never?

343
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:45,950
-I only saw this when he was small but now since he was 10, I only see his tears in his

344
00:54:46,050 --> 00:55:03,030
eyes and I ask what it is and he won’t tell me and I ask and then he does like this.

345
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,110
-Confirming.

346
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:25,280
-Yes.

347
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:32,550
-She made an observation and she does not want to talk about it. She said 2 days ago

348
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:52,780
he ate lots of chips.

349
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,950
-We sat next, he was there and I was here and he always …

350
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,700
-How much? A packet?

351
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:04,730
-I think so, he can do that very easy.

352
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:08,200
-But potato chips is very bad for him.

353
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:15,700
-Not the worse.

354
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:29,400
-The worse is coca-cola.

355
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:45,230
-Maybe I tell you one thing more. We had an accident in home when he was 8 years old.

356
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:53,720
The oldest son he was playing with the daughter and he get a little knife in the eye of the

357
00:56:53,820 --> 00:57:16,000
brother. By accident. It was almost blinded but he had to take out the lids so the sight is

358
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:26,400
almost good but it was dangerous that we didn’t know if he will lose his eye or not.

359
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:33,570
When this happened my boy said it was his finger because he didn’t want to talk about it

360
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:43,570
and he didn’t want this. They call from hospital and asked what it was and I said, you

361
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:54,320
have to tell because they must know and then he just run away. I was running after him

362
00:57:54,420 --> 00:58:06,420
and he was lost for about 2 hours and he never talks about it and I have only said he

363
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:19,170
could do nothing about it but he doesn’t want to talk about it.

364
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:25,670
I don’t know if it bothers him or not, he never talks about this.

365
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:34,120
-He never explained how this happened actually? That it was by knife and I did like this?

366
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:49,340
-No, the little girl was on a little bike and the brother was pushing her and he was going

367
00:58:49,440 --> 00:59:02,530
to play with them but he had this in his hand and he was coming to his place by accident.

368
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:21,000
He told that later. It was the same day when I push him because the doctor has to know.

369
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:37,000
I think the accident was after he got diabetes.

370
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:48,510
-The boy was examined before and no diabetes was found or not examined before?

371
00:59:48,610 --> 01:00:00,500
It was examined by chance or somebody diagnosed it? A doctor, a homeopath?

372
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:08,510
Who diagnosed it? It was a doctor?

373
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:11,000
-Yes a doctor.

374
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:27,920
-And how? By symptoms or by blood?

375
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:33,180
-She thought that he had diabetes and they sent him to the doctor.

376
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:47,970
-Why the doctor thought he had diabetes? On the first place? He must has seen some

377
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:52,980
symptoms.

378
01:00:53,080 --> 01:01:02,990
-Yes, she told him that he has urinated during the night.

379
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:11,970
-That’s all? He urinated a lot? Why don’t you say a lot? To urinate a night is different

380
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:19,640
than urinate a lot, coming out. This urination when it started?

381
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:32,050
-He was always urinating a lot but it got worse. Before he got the insulin.

382
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:39,560
-Yes but the diabetes in this case is not diagnosed suddenly, unless it’s very special

383
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:51,060
case. It is a process, in juvenile diabetes is a process and you recognize it after 1,2 years

384
01:01:51,160 --> 01:02:02,310
by some symptoms. First of all great thirst, then much urination. So this symptom much

385
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:06,810
thirst, much urination when it started? Then we will know when the diabetes started.

386
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:14,470
When they took the blood sugar?

387
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:18,980
-He has always been drinking a lot since he was a child.

388
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:31,720
-So diabetes was there for years and at a certain point it got worse because as the years

389
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:42,220
go by, these cases go worse and worse. This is the natural development of the case.

390
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:48,730
-They took the blood sugar at the hospital when he was born and he didn’t have high

391
01:02:48,830 --> 01:02:58,640
level because he was a big boy.

392
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:08,900
-So they checked. But the tendency was there definitely.

393
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:19,090
-Was the blood sugar of the mother checked? Because big baby means the sugar of the

394
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:26,590
mother is high and therefore the baby produces a lot of insulin and after birth he gets

395
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:39,060
hypoglycemia. That’s why they are so big because they produce insulin during pregnancy

396
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:45,230
the fetus. He must produce because the blood sugar is so high and that’s why it’s

397
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:46,970
getting so big.

398
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:53,720
-But he was very long and a big head.

399
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:55,970
-What was your blood sugar?

400
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:59,970
-I don’t know but I think it was normal.

401
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:07,220
-You never experience excessive thirst, excessive urination, desire for sweets?

402
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:16,300
-No.

403
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:29,800
-Why do I make the discussion? Can anybody tell me? Why I do this analysis?

404
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:36,560
-To get information?

405
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:43,990
-There is nothing accidental in Homeopathy. Why do I do this? Because there are

406
01:04:44,090 --> 01:04:50,890
certain laws that we have to follow and we know it is like this.

407
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:58,640
And the law says, when you have an incurable case, you consider it an incurable case

408
01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:02,560
and we have said this is an incurable case and you give a remedy and there is an

409
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:20,560
aggravation, then you better antidote that remedy. This is observation 7 or 8 by Kent.

410
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:26,560
He said something much worse, I don’t want to say it because I don’t want to scare you

411
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:34,470
but you can go to the observations after the remedy in incurable cases and you see when

412
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:48,460
there is an aggravation, you have to antidote because it’s not going to be an amelioration.

413
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:55,220
That’s why I brought this case and it has to be discussed and it has to be decided, we

414
01:05:55,320 --> 01:06:03,960
can just let it go, let it go? How far you can let it go if it’s incurable?

415
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:12,120
-But if you don’t know how many carbohydrates the boy eats, you can’t really check this

416
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:16,670
you can’t evaluate if this is aggravating or not.

417
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:28,400
-That is true but the boy is here for 15 days already and the first 8 days he gets here in

418
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:35,460
these conditions, environment etc. he gets 20 units. We give a remedy and after the

419
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:41,460
remedy with the same conditions, the units become more than double. Then you can’t

420
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:49,410
doubt about the action of the remedy, you can not. This is asking for excuses. If I want an

421
01:06:49,510 --> 01:06:58,120
excuse I say, the boy eats badly now. He eats badly immediately after the remedy?

422
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:05,630
Because the mother says, he got from 8-20 units the day before. He takes the remedy

423
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:15,630
and he gets 45. So whatever it might be the discrepancies I can not attribute to the

424
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:26,130
difference on diet from one day to the other. Facts are facts.

425
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:36,140
-Can I say one thing? I feel it’s a little misunderstanding. He has very easy diabetes to

426
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:45,130
control at home and he is very fine. The doctor says he is very special, it’s above 7

427
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:54,230
every time he comes to the doctor, the long insulin and at home he can eat some chips

428
01:07:54,330 --> 01:08:00,860
and he can eat some sweets and he takes a little more insulin and everything is all right.

429
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:09,080
But now when we begin Phos he tried this 2-3 times and it didn’t work, it didn’t come

430
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:19,050
down so easily as at home. So we have seen that but today he has only eaten 3 breads

431
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:54,690
and it comes so high even though.

432
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:58,630
has created… then again you have to retake the case and see whether you can find a

433
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:06,080
-I have plan to be talking about the different reactions that you get after the remedy.

434
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:13,280
Actually I see this is very important because you can not really discriminate what is an

435
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:24,790
aggravation, where is an aggravation, when it should be kept, when it should be tried.

436
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:33,730
Anyhow I think maybe we’ll do it in the next seminar these observations, I don’t know.

437
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:42,950
-How do we antidote in this case? When he is sensitive?

438
01:09:43,050 --> 01:10:00,010
-Maybe with another remedy. It’s not the antidote. You just have given a remedy that

439
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:07,800
remedy that will improve. Actually the Phos, as you said before, it had improved the

440
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:17,210
situation, right? Without aggravation? Correct.

441
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:24,960
Phos was not anymore needed at this moment, maybe later on.

442
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:29,460
-But when Phos was given it was low.

443
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:44,460
-Yes but low or high it should not bring such an aggravation. It’s quite strong.

444
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:54,710
-I saw in Hahnemann, if you get aggravation in chronic, in the beginning it was too high.

445
01:10:54,810 --> 01:11:12,710
-No. When you get an aggravation is very good sign, as long as it’s curable.

446
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:24,230
I would suggest 2 things in this case, the first is that I would prescribe the Carcinosin

447
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:36,980
and since you are leaving tomorrow, you can only call from Norway to give a feedback

448
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:48,740
of what’s happening and then in case this does not control either, then we have to

449
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:58,140
rethink about the case.

450
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:08,900
I can’t remember why I changed prescription?

451
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,640
-He liked cucumbers.

452
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:22,140
-In a case like this would you consider giving Carcinosin in a lower potency, maybe

453
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:29,900
even considering an LM potency because of the fragility of the case and the possibility

454
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:36,810
of still further aggravations? With the LM potencies is possible to have the most

455
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:44,310
amount of control of the action of the remedy of the organism.

456
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:54,730
-In this case you can not go higher than 200. 200 is the highest. But on the other hand

457
01:12:54,830 --> 01:13:19,970
considering Carcinosin, it’s not a remedy that you repeat frequently, at least I had not

458
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:24,490
-It is important that after Carcinosin which already he received once, the blood sugar

459
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:30,810
went up so much and then the class corrects and says, no it went down after the remedy.

460
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:44,570
-Fast up and down, up fast and down fast, this is what she reported.

461
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:50,810
-Can you tell us there have been reports in different preparations of Carcinosin.

462
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:55,570
Do you have any particular one that you feel you will use?

463
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:56,980
-No.

464
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:59,730
-They are all the same?

465
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:11,780
-To me yes, as long as it is Cancerinum not Scirrhinum, from Scirrhus. If the name is

466
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:18,430
Cancerinum it should be from the same source, this is a matter that has to be taken

467
01:14:18,530 --> 01:14:23,960
care by the pharmacies, not by me. When I say Cancerinum they are supposed to

468
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:34,920
give me the same substance.

469
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:43,450
I don’t know that, it’s the first time I hear it. Scirrhinum there is from Scirrhus cancer.

470
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:49,890
But when I say Cancerinum it is supposed to be from one source.

471
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:55,140
-Would it be an idea to have him go home tomorrow, have the situation that he always

472
01:14:55,240 --> 01:15:02,390
had, watch the blood sugar in Norway where the situation is the same as always and

473
01:15:02,490 --> 01:15:09,310
then maybe after having the normal life, as it always was, then give him the Cancerinum

474
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:17,060
and see what happens then because in this situation we can’t really tell.

475
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:27,550
-You see this is all right telling but actually if he eats only once and he needs 48 units

476
01:15:27,650 --> 01:15:40,260
the situation is not to be left.

477
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:52,760
And it needs more careful monitor, perhaps. When you go there you check the blood

478
01:15:52,860 --> 01:16:08,510
sugar by this machine. What is your type? It’s a good one?

479
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:20,680
-Yes, he does it himself.

480
01:16:20,780 --> 01:16:29,680
-This is the case group 4, I would think that there should be in these cases, in group 4

481
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:37,130
we have immediate amelioration because you can not have an aggravation, immediate

482
01:16:37,230 --> 01:16:48,370
amelioration and then another remedy appears. To do really careful work, it has to be

483
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:58,040
monitored in such a way that every time with every change of symptoms, we take notice

484
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:06,010
and we see whether the picture of another remedy is appearing.

485
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:18,940
After this analysis, before taking Carcinosin, Margaret was given certain information

486
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:27,670
more. She gave me a list of 10 symptoms like this one here and within these, there

487
01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:35,840
were 2 keynotes of Phos. One was desire for cucumber and the other?

488
01:17:35,940 --> 01:17:39,350
-Strong desire for ice cream.

489
01:17:39,450 --> 01:17:46,540
-If you remember in the analysis I said, it doesn’t matter for that symptom but the

490
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:55,010
desire for cucumber was so strong and she confirmed, I said most probably and I

491
01:17:55,110 --> 01:18:03,100
changed it.

492
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:11,090
What can you do? These things with the language and the type of situation we are now

493
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:20,100
under stress, the same was happening with the girl with the colitis. She came back and

494
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:28,760
she gave information that was really for Causticum and then it was very clear but her

495
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:35,260
case was very clear, this case is not clear. If we put the analysis back you will see how

496
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:43,420
I vacillated to go back to Phos because my impression was that Phos had done all

497
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:48,620
it could do, forget it for a moment, needs another remedy and then maybe again Phos

498
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:59,350
again Nat mur or again another remedy. At this moment the most prominent for me was

499
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:24,090
Carcinosin, that’s why I would like him to take Carcinosin.

500
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:31,100
-All his energy was gone, he was tired, he did not go out with his friends for a whole

501
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:45,600
month, he got pain under his heels and knees, so it was impossible to play football.

502
01:19:45,700 --> 01:20:03,970
He tried, after 5 min he had to stop. On the 15th of July he got Pulsatilla 200, all the

503
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:16,780
pains in the heels and knees were gone, now he had 2 days with his hands, they were

504
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:27,880
very cold which is a new symptom, he felt tired for some days and then ameliorate and

505
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:40,800
started to go out with his friends again although they mostly came to the house.

506
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:50,540
After a month he got nose bleeding in the night, which is an old symptom, he had this

507
01:20:50,640 --> 01:21:07,550
often as a little boy, the nose is stuffed and it irritates in the night and it ends up quite

508
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:25,290
a lot of nose bleeding. He had this 3 or 4 nights and then it stopped. Two weeks ago he

509
01:21:25,390 --> 01:21:39,380
developed inflammation in his right big toe, it was red, swollen and painful. He had this

510
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:54,880
many times before, now it was much more severe and painful, I was not allowed to be

511
01:21:54,980 --> 01:22:07,740
near it but he tried to get some pus with a needle, nothing came out, 3 or 4 days it went

512
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:20,740
away by itself. For a week ago he had some skin eruption on his right shoulder, it was

513
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:33,490
stitching pain and was itchy and they were little red spots which is a new symptom.

514
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:40,240
He also has loose skin inside his hands and fingers, the skin fell off which is an old

515
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:50,740
symptom.

516
01:22:50,840 --> 01:23:00,230
-You see what happens with these cases? The pains in the knees, better, no aggravation

517
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:05,180
then some other symptoms are developing, then even some skin comes out but the skin

518
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:16,400
is a little bit of eruption, stays for 1 week and goes away, no real reaction. The organism

519
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:26,150
is battling and comes back, it can not get it out.

520
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:38,570
-He loves chicken wings and he can eat them every day, grilled with spice.

521
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:50,260
But the last 3 weeks he got nausea of eating them and he had to stop, he wants them and

522
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:59,020
stops because of nausea, which is a new symptom. For 3 weeks now he has been

523
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:11,010
sighing every day but he is not aware of it. He is spitting during the day, I think he must

524
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:21,170
have a lot of salivation but this is not a new symptom. He lies restless, not covering

525
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:35,430
in bed, fears he does not want to go out in boat, which is an old symptom.

526
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:42,180
Considering the blood sugar, after Carcinosin he comes back to the level he had before

527
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:55,110
Phos which is 18-20 units the day. With Pulsatilla the first night he woke up and needed

528
01:24:55,210 --> 01:25:07,100
some sugar because he was low in blood sugar. This happens a lot at nights, the first

529
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:25,770
2 weeks, maybe 3 times the week and he had to reduce his dose in the night with 3 units

530
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:36,760
from 8 to 5. In the day the blood sugar could be low, more often than before, so he had

531
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:53,600
to be careful taking his insulin. But after one and a half month, he gradually went back

532
01:25:53,700 --> 01:26:04,370
to the same state as before Pulsatilla. That’s it.

533
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:14,840
-You see group number 4? Typical reaction to group number 4. He is here, you give a remedy

534
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:21,260
better for a while, then back, then new symptoms, then another remedy, then you try

535
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:33,340
again and again and again but you never know, you can not predict. Continue.

536
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:41,340
-That’s all.

537
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,090
-Pulsatilla 200.

538
01:26:44,190 --> 01:27:08,760
-Yes but he is sighing a lot now, very much.

539
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:10,760
-So we give him Ignatia.

540
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:18,200
-I don’t know. Maybe he needs the remedy more often because it helped him.

541
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,750
-The Pulsatilla?

542
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:34,020
-Yes, he only got it once.

543
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:47,010
that remedy and you say you have to repeat it but still I don’t see.

544
01:27:47,110 --> 01:27:49,460
Sighing now, a lot?

545
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:55,590
-A lot.

546
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:59,770
-He likes to travel?

547
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:07,960
-No, he likes to travel but mostly to be at home I think.

548
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:16,880
-And you think that he reduced eating fruits?

549
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:20,130
-He loves fruits.

550
01:28:20,230 --> 01:28:21,100
-Still eats them?

551
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,120
-Yes.

552
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:31,380
-You didn’t notice that lately he isn’t eating fruits. That would be a good indication

553
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:40,490
for instance, a little bit of confirmation for Ignatia but she does not confirm it.

554
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:50,960
-I don’t think so. He is not alone at home but he reads, he looks at the television and

555
01:28:51,060 --> 01:29:18,120
so on but if he goes with friends, he never phones them, they come to him. Never.

556
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:36,130
He is troubled to tell about himself even if it is something better, it doesn’t matter, he

557
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:39,380
-Never, as far as you can remember?

558
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:53,300
-No. He is bothered by pains and so on, today I have a pain here, a pain there but not

559
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,040
if anything is deeper.

560
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,040
-No emotions.

561
01:29:56,140 --> 01:30:02,040
-No he can’t.

562
01:30:02,140 --> 01:30:13,290
-Calc phos?

563
01:30:13,390 --> 01:30:21,080
-But Calc phos has to be discontent. Is he discontent?

564
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:28,170
-No.

565
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:37,780
-Not so much. He never talks about himself and problems, he can not do this.

566
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:47,250
-What about his friends and how he behaved before? Now he withdraws more, he

567
01:30:47,350 --> 01:30:54,250
stays more by himself or his behavior with the friends is the same?

568
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:59,000
-He is more by himself.

569
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:03,700
-When he sees television, when he plays computer, what he does?

570
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:10,920
-He does, he sees television and plays computer and we have a large family, we are

571
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:21,660
6 in the family, he is very good in sport, he is the best in the school, in everything.

572
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:24,410
-In lessons also?

573
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:27,110
-In sports.

574
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:52,840
-In every sport he is very good. That’s a contradiction. Anybody has any idea?

575
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:58,080
When he perspires where he perspires mostly?

576
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:05,330
-On the head and on the feet, he is sweat on the feet.

577
01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:06,840
-Face?

578
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:18,580
-Yes in the night and when he is sporting he perspires on his face a lot and he becomes

579
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:26,830
very red.

580
01:32:26,930 --> 01:32:35,330
-Is it possible that the whole thing has started when he was 3 years old for instance?

581
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:37,080
-Yes I think so.

582
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:38,840
-What year?

583
01:32:38,940 --> 01:32:51,000
-When he was 3 years, he didn’t tolerate milk and he was very bad of the milk and he

584
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:54,760
got a lot of ear ache.

585
01:32:54,860 --> 01:33:05,500
-What I wanted to ask is, is it possible when he was about 3 years old, that you had a

586
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:18,000
quarrel with your husband and he was in the room. is it possible? You remember such

587
01:33:18,100 --> 01:33:20,250
incident?

588
01:33:20,350 --> 01:33:24,340
-No.

589
01:33:34,190 --> 01:33:43,220
-I can know. We don’t use to have that quarrel.

590
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:50,970
-Is it possible that you had a brother or a sister who was sick?

591
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:58,470
-My husband lost his father.

592
01:33:58,570 --> 01:34:01,310
-At the age of?

593
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:10,930
-It is 13 years ago, he was 2 years old. But he was not so connected because we

594
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:16,380
don’t live in the same town. My husband was very connected.

595
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:17,590
-And your husband was affected?

596
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:26,800
-Yes, very. He got diabetes a year after.

597
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:37,560
And he doesn’t show it, I’m happy, I go and take insulin, no problem.

598
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:50,560
-Norwegian way. You don’t even open your mouth when you speak.

599
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:54,560
-I try to.

600
01:34:54,660 --> 01:35:17,470
-All the Norwegians, they speak with closed mouth so the cold air does not come in.

601
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:34,720
I have problems understanding Norwegians and Swedish when they speak, always.

602
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:45,970
It is possible that the child might had a traumatic experience something perceived

603
01:35:46,070 --> 01:35:57,960
instinctively, he saw something. It might be that he saw the father destroyed and crying

604
01:35:58,060 --> 01:35:59,240
and the child…

605
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:14,980
-He never cried. He does not show it, the father too. Even when the father does

606
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:22,990
not show, the child is more perceptive to receive the mood of the father, he doesn’t have

607
01:36:23,090 --> 01:36:37,900
to say nothing but he was so little.

608
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:42,400
-He must be a little bit more than 2.

609
01:36:42,500 --> 01:37:06,650
-It was in April and I have a son who is 13 and I was pregnant when he died.

610
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:08,160
-You were pregnant?

611
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:38,320
-Yes with another one, not with him. I was pregnant and he is 13 now.

612
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:39,580
-And the son is?

613
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:48,100
-He is 15.

614
01:37:48,200 --> 01:38:07,300
-We can try, it’s desperate case but we can try. It is good if we try this remedy in low

615
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:20,560
potency, like 12, 3 times the day but every 10 days raise one potency and see what

616
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:35,800
happens in 1-2 months, whether the sugar level may start coming down.

617
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:42,550
-Which remedy?

618
01:38:42,650 --> 01:39:01,580
-When he was little he always stumbled, when he runs he is clumsy in a way and he still

619
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:07,300
is with this now.

620
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:08,290
-He is still clumsy.

621
01:39:08,390 --> 01:39:23,550
-But he is good in sports, he is in handball and he reacts very fast.

622
01:39:23,650 --> 01:39:33,960
-Quick to react and rapid in execution.

623
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:42,720
Ignatia 12 for a few months, see what happens.

624
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:49,890
-In such a severe case los of energy for one month, it’s not such a bad symptom and also

625
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:57,510
that he developed these joint pains is not so bad, so I’m trying to understand why then it

626
01:39:57,610 --> 01:40:02,000
was changed to Pulsatilla.

627
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:10,260
-Because if we had a good reaction then after the aggravation, we suppose to have an

628
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:18,010
aggravation, then we have to see the amelioration, which we did not see really.

629
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:25,460
These cases, as I described, they change picture. You give a remedy, they will take it.

630
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:32,170
You will see now after Ignatia, the picture will change but the basic disease will remain

631
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:39,340
the same, so what we are expecting at one moment, when you will have a reaction from

632
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:46,510
the remedy, when you have an aggravation in this case, it’s going to be very strong.

633
01:40:46,610 --> 01:40:52,510
It’s going to be something very strong.

634
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:59,260
-As far as I have understood the process of this case, he had good reactions after Pulsat.

635
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,750
Why do we now change to Ignatia?

636
01:41:01,850 --> 01:41:10,750
-Because, as I explained to you, in this group you give a remedy, there is some reaction

637
01:41:10,850 --> 01:41:17,010
it feels better for a while, then either come back the symptoms or new symptoms

638
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:23,370
develop. When new symptoms develop, you go along with the new symptoms and you

639
01:41:23,470 --> 01:41:31,730
prescribe for the new symptoms. He brought out some new symptoms, he withdrew more

640
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:44,730
he stayed more at home, he sighs and these are new guiding symptoms, it’s not a clear

641
01:41:44,830 --> 01:41:53,480
case of Ignatia but you have some new guiding symptoms that tell you that maybe there

642
01:41:53,580 --> 01:42:01,500
is some traumatic experience after which the whole thing started and yes there is.

643
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:09,470
Now she confirms here that the grand father and the child, I don’t know how much

644
01:42:09,570 --> 01:42:18,720
perceptive he might have been and we know that children are affected very much when

645
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:25,220
we are not aware, that is true. Now putting all this together…

646
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:31,730
Of course it’s a little bit of projection to say that the child of 2 years perceived the father

647
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:40,950
being very sad and the child had a shock, it’s a projection, it’s not good but we don’t base

648
01:42:41,050 --> 01:42:49,890
everything on that projection alone, we base it on the fact that the child started sighing

649
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:57,140
and the child is also withdrawn, he doesn’t express his emotions. Now with the sighing

650
01:42:57,240 --> 01:43:07,480
all this comes to a little bit better picture than before, not that the picture is clear but it’s a

651
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:17,520
little bit clearer than before. Therefore you have to go by these guiding things and see

652
01:43:17,620 --> 01:43:21,010
what happens.

653
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:27,510
-How did you differentiate Ignatia from Nat mur?

654
01:43:27,610 --> 01:43:29,760
-Nat mur will not sigh.

655
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:35,180
-Yes it has sighing.

656
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:42,450
-When the main symptom, which she mentions, is sighing then you go. Of course there

657
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:53,340
are 60 remedies that have sighing but maybe later on he may need some Nat mur but at

658
01:43:53,440 --> 01:44:01,540
this moment with the story, with the withdrawal, with everything she says, we have to

659
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:14,270
think of Ignatia. But when in a case let's say of grief, when the main symptom is sighing you

660
01:44:14,370 --> 01:44:21,520
first give Ignatia, then you may need to give Nat mur but first you give Ignatia.

661
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:29,930
Did he have Nat mur before? Phos acid?

662
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:33,680
-No.

663
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:38,940
-So we start with Ignatia and see what happens.

664
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:48,100
-When she was reading this I put some rubrics together and they were mainly Pulsatilla.

665
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:55,110
Every rubric it came right on top and then I thought it’s clear because the remedy did

666
01:44:55,210 --> 01:45:09,430
what it could, now as we get more information from your report, then as you see, there is

667
01:45:09,530 --> 01:45:25,630
perspiration foot and perspiration head it comes to this. That means it is not clear, it is not

668
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:38,380
so prominent because it is group 4 but differentiation between Phos acid and Ignatia from

669
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:44,120
the system.

670
01:45:44,220 --> 01:45:53,290
-He is thinking the same way.

671
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:58,550
-In cases like this where it is very complicated and confused case, would you consider a

672
01:45:58,650 --> 01:46:05,300
very small remedy like Crataegus.

673
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:08,570
-I would consider but not Crataegus in this case.

674
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:19,460
-Even though it’s a major remedy for child diabetes.

675
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:26,380
-When I’m totally desperate and I don’t know what to do anymore, I will take 5 of these

676
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:37,880
remedies, give them all together. I mean you can do anything, after you have tried and

677
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:47,380
no real effect, then you try anything, you may try anything because maybe under

678
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:56,580
something it will react but what we are trying to do is to bring some order to the organism

679
01:46:56,680 --> 01:47:01,960
so the organism eventually will show some clear picture. The moment it shows a clear

680
01:47:02,060 --> 01:47:11,140
picture you will see the difference. If we manage to do that, this case is a case of group 4

681
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:23,460
as we said, so this is exactly what you have to expect. Maybe after Ignatia we have a

682
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:34,710
picture of Nat mur and after Nat mur we may have a clear picture of Phos acid and you

683
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:39,310
give Phos acid and it’s beautiful.
