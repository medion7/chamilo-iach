1
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:28,640
-A young man, what is your problem?

2
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:44,140
-First of all the main complain right now is constipation, which begun one year ago.

3
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:54,040
The nature of the constipation has changed. Sometimes is 2-3 days, 4 days, dry,

4
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:08,300
very painful. The second main complain is some kind of inflammation, which begun

5
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:23,480
maybe 8-9 years ago; at that time I was in the army.

6
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:31,650
There was a hernia operation on the left side, which was operated in the army.

7
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:41,650
One year after the operation there was the beginning of a discharge.

8
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:49,490
While there is the effort to give stool there is discharge, very sticky and look like

9
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,160
sperm from the sexual organ. Only when there is the effort to give stool.

10
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:09,560
Since then there is a lot of pain in the scar area from the operation.

11
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,800
There is cicatrices.

12
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:20,290
On the left side there is a scar from the hernia operation. Since the operation there is all

13
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:28,220
the time a lot of pain in the scar area, very sharp like knife, as if the cutting is still there.

14
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:38,630
The pain of the scar remains since the operation and since the operation the doctors

15
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:48,300
told me there is a local inflammation, which probably begun at the local area of the scar

16
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,810
and developed to the prostate gland.

17
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,460
The sign of the inflammation in the prostate gland basically is discharge, only when there

18
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,600
is the effort to give stool.

19
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:26,630
They examined this discharge and they said there is a sign of inflammation from streptococcus

20
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,420
and staphylococcus aureus.

21
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,390
As well there was hernia when I was just born.

22
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:10,640
The history of the hernia operation is going like that. I was born with hernia which was

23
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,310
operated when I was 3-4 years old, it was on the right side.

24
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,390
And then the second one was on the left side when I was 20 years old, 9 years ago.

25
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:52,230
You told me to take Selenium in June. I took it but no help, no change.

26
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:22,300
-What is the next? What other problem you have?

27
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,620
-Physically right now this is the main problem, the problem which is worrying me at the

28
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,390
moment is the problem with the discharge, the inflammation in the scar area.

29
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,950
I spoke with a few doctors in Israel and they say, one of them said that it might put

30
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:48,890
the sperm into danger. So this seems to me right now the main problem to treat.

31
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,790
-Another problem?

32
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:02,960
-Basically I would say the last 3 years there is general weakness, something which

33
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,980
is chronic fatigue.

34
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,290
-So strong that it looks like chronic fatigue?

35
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,870
-This is the way I experience it because I remember myself with huge amount of energy.

36
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:25,870
I remember myself with so much energy, when I was from 11-25…

37
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,730
23,24 I had huge amount of energy, like a bomb of energy.

38
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,620
-And why you lost this energy? What happened?

39
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,210
-I don’t know, I can’t really say something specific, a general exhaustion, becoming

40
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,820
more and more exhausted.

41
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,790
-Yes but it must be a reason. Why?
-I can’t really say.

42
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:55,630
There is many incidents which contribute to this situation of being

43
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,560
exhausted, there is many of them actually.

44
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,210
-Like what?

45
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:12,130
-First of all I must say about the hernia operation in the army that at that time I was

46
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,950
under tremendous amount of pressure, really tremendous.

47
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,470
It’s really hard for me to describe how much stressful was at that time.

48
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,290
-Why it was stressful for you? You had somebody after you or you were afraid or you

49
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,740
didn’t want to shoot, to fight, why?

50
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:44,040
-First of all the army is stressful by itself, the army life is a stressful thing but

51
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:51,310
what happened to me one year before the army, I was born in a kibbutz.

52
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,040
-So you are a kibbutz boy.

53
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:09,970
-Unfortunately. Anyway the kibbutz is unreligious life style.

54
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,710
When I was 16 years old I changed all the structure life for myself.

55
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:24,620
I just left school I left my home, I left everything and I went to Jerusalem to some kind

56
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:33,050
of commune place where after that you become religious person.

57
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:39,310
-Very religious?
-Not very, extremely religious.

58
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,220
So when I went to the army there was a few vectors

59
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,410
of pressure, from many angles, the family, the religion aspect, the army aspect,

60
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:56,480
the personal aspect. From many angles there was a…

61
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,790
-Conflict?

62
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:06,790
-Conflict yes, I would say that but not only that, as well the objective like the family

63
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,140
and all the rest.

64
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,960
-Why the family?

65
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:18,710
-The family want me to become again non-religious and the people in the army they

66
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:25,640
couldn’t understand what is going on, so them as well gave me a lot of hard time.

67
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:35,880
And the religious people where I was then, them as well put on me a lot of stress

68
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,640
to do all sorts of things.

69
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,460
-Being religious you are not supposed to go to the army?

70
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:52,230
-Yes. They wanted me to leave the army and it’s a long story here.

71
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,740
-And escape.

72
00:10:54,770 --> 00:11:02,640
-So I was in the middle of all that and as well, as you said, there was much conflict

73
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:13,050
in me about all those things of god, religion, different ceremonies and different issues

74
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,830
about life and all that.

75
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,690
-Life beyond death.

76
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:26,050
-A lot, I was busy with this. When I say that I went extremely into it, 24 hours the day

77
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:30,820
for a few years only with that, nothing else.

78
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,220
-And during this time you are not allowed of course to have sex or you are allowed?

79
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,570
-No of course, only when you are married.

80
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:51,130
-And was that a stress for you, that aspect?
-Yes very much.

81
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,890
-Because you had a lot of energy and then you had to spend this energy.

82
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:04,300
-Yes, concerning this thing I had a few girlfriend because I became religious, so at

83
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,300
that time when I became extremely religious this subject for me was very hard

84
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,550
to become celibate, it’s very hard for me.

85
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:26,720
As well people which I engaged then, they put on me all sorts of ideas as you go to hell

86
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:32,160
all this rubbish, you produce demon in the world.

87
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:42,390
So with that came a lot of guilt because of sexual feelings or attraction; with that there

88
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,160
was a lot of guilt coming.

89
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,560
But the hernia itself at the time when it happened I remember it’s very clear the way it

90
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,810
happened. It was very funny thing. I just walked in the army, physical walk and then

91
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:08,490
I sneezed and with this I felt it out of the intestines coming out.

92
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,820
-And it was operated you say at the age of?
-20.

93
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,150
-But you lost your energy at 24.

94
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:33,990
How long you stayed in the army?
-3 years. From 18-21.

95
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:40,220
-And then you worked or you went back to the religious group?

96
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,390
-I continued to be with them for 3 years.

97
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,470
-For another 3 years?

98
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,850
-I’ve been with this kind of thing for 3 years until I dropped it.

99
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:59,330
I’ve been with that for 3 years, with this kind of life style, of very religious.

100
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:06,940
-Which years?
-I begun 17,18,19 and 20 I left.

101
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:18,630
-So while you were in the army, you left the group. Correct?

102
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:28,700
-Then when I was 20 at the time when I left that religious extreme group, I went to

103
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:39,110
another group of spiritual search, which I met in Israel, I’ve been with them for 3 years

104
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,370
as well, another 3 years of very intense spiritual quest.

105
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,950
-Spiritual practices.

106
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:51,950
-Yes, all sorts of meditations and researches about religion, about colors, numbers

107
00:14:52,050 --> 00:15:02,290
all esoteric subjects that you can imagine. I’ve been with them 3 years and then as well

108
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,880
I left them.

109
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:12,220
At that time I went to the States to be a counselor in American summer camps.

110
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,470
After that I went to Indian tribe, I became to be an Indian member.

111
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,200
-You lived like an Indian.

112
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:36,890
-Yes, I went to an Indian reservation and I lived with them for a few months,

113
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:48,370
for about 4 month and they accept me immediately, for them there was no question.

114
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:58,720
They did some kind of ceremony and god tell them whether I belong to the tribe or not.

115
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:07,780
So the chief told me that two months before I came to the tribe, he knew already that some

116
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:14,300
Israeli boy is supposed to come because god told him that this person belongs to the tribe.

117
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,970
-So you stayed with them for how long?
-For 4 months.

118
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,130
-But you could not stay anymore?
-The visa finished, I had to go back.

119
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:30,220
-You liked this place there?
-Yes, that place changed my life.

120
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,450
-You felt good?

121
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:40,540
-Living in nature, living in a totally natural tribe, living with the trees, living with

122
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,890
the rivers, with the birds, with the bees…

123
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,700
-Did you have to work while you were with them?
-Yes.

124
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,370
-What work you did?

125
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:56,870
-Everything but it’s not actually a work, it’s part of joining the tribal life style which is

126
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,540
you won’t do nothing which you are not qualified or don’t want to do. Whatever you will

127
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,310
do is coming out of yourself.

128
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:19,080
For long time we did many spiritual practices of the Indian culture and after 3 months

129
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:26,330
they want me to qualify me to become an Indian philosophy teacher because I read

130
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:32,430
all the library which they had, a huge room.

131
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:44,070
-You had specific interest on their life and philosophy? You felt at home with them?

132
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:50,510
-Yes, definitely. Very good connection, very immediate connection.

133
00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,680
Immediately straight to the core and the essence and the meaning…

134
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,580
-And when you went back to Israel what you did there?

135
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,100
-Before I went to the States, I begun to learn Chinese Medicine.

136
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,830
When I went back to Israel I continued to study Chinese Medicine and I finished that,

137
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:28,510
I became to be a Chinese practitioner, as well I became to be teacher in Chinese Medicine.

138
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:43,080
-Something has happened in your health, I try to find out what was happening in your

139
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,330
health that brought down all this.

140
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:54,350
-When I went back from the States in Israel at that time I was still belong to the kibbutz.

141
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:01,330
Then there was something about argument about if the kibbutz would help me to study

142
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,750
Chinese Medicine or not, they say they won’t help me with this.

143
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:13,500
I say OK I leave. So I left the kibbutz and when I left the kibbutz I left without even 1 cent

144
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:23,660
to begin life. But then I had to pay rent of living in the city and as well rent of the school

145
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:34,940
and at that time I learned at the University first degree of human behavior.

146
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:42,290
So I learned with one University, with second University and I had two Universities to pay

147
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,250
rent, huge amount of money to pay.

148
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,540
-They were not supposed to give you some money?

149
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,890
-They were supposed but they didn’t and it was really small amount.

150
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,300
They gave me amount which is for 2 weeks living in the city, without doing nothing.

151
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:15,430
They gave me 150 $ to be precise. Anytime at that time I lived for 6 months with only

152
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:25,550
eating bread and I really lived for 6 months a poor life and I remember that after this

153
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:35,470
winter of living for half a year only with bread, the whole health condition really went down.

154
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:47,630
As well I lived at that time in a very old place in Jerusalem, in which the room was very

155
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:54,950
cold and humid and after this period of 6 months, I remember that was the main year

156
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,060
in which the whole health condition …

157
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:14,290
But what I tell you now is really a short cut of the story. It was many other things which

158
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:19,640
happened at that time, many other things, also spiritual stuff and groups and people

159
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,550
which I was involved of many kinds.

160
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:47,960
-During all these years how did you feel emotionally? You felt angry, you felt let down

161
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:56,050
you felt betrayed, you felt depressed, you felt anxious, you felt fears,

162
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,880
how you were feeling all these years?

163
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,790
-What do you mean all these years?

164
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:11,460
-From the time that you went to the religious group, 17, 18 ,19, then you went to the army…

165
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:17,890
You can say I felt this or that, can you give me an idea how you felt?

166
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:28,800
-I can’t really describe in one word but when it begun I was at 16,17 at that time the whole

167
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,540
life changed upside down and the main thing which happened at that time was an

168
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:42,220
avalanche or crisis or earthquake of everything which was in me, physically and emotionally.

169
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:52,130
I actually experienced in myself actual earthquake in which everything completed

170
00:22:52,230 --> 00:23:01,650
destroyed becoming dust like and then it felt a need to rebuild everything.

171
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:09,290
At that time I was under very severe condition of depression and loneliness.

172
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,930
I would sit all along in my room alone.

173
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,230
-You talk just before entering that religious group?
-Yes, when I was 16,17.

174
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:28,960
-You shaken down was because of the kibbutz situation or because of your parents?

175
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:35,460
-I can’t really say, I can’t really see what is the reason for this thing.

176
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,740
Of course I can give you some explanation but I don’t feel it will be the actual one.

177
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,930
I can’t really put my finger, what was the thing which really caused it.

178
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,740
-While you were in this deep depression, you found that group.

179
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:58,070
-As well that kind of crisis I used to …

180
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:07,250
It’s slight difficult to explain because just before this kind of thing, of change,

181
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:17,330
I was the best in school, the best in sport activities, the best in learning and when

182
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:23,090
that thing happened everything changed upside down and I became from extrovert to introvert.

183
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,180
And all the energy which I had, and I had a bomb of energy, went from outside to the inside.

184
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:40,150
And I begun to write poetry, to paint paintings, to read many books but I mean huge

185
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,000
amount of books. If you know Jewish religion …

186
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,490
-It’s huge.

187
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:53,320
-It’s more than huge, it’s unnumbered books about god and whatever.

188
00:24:53,420 --> 00:25:01,010
So I used to read, take for example the Bible and read it 50, 60 times.

189
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:08,340
-And then you enter that group and you felt better psychologically?

190
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:14,490
-No, I can’t really say, I don’t think that this group really changed something in the

191
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,680
emotional suffering, I don’t think so.

192
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,330
-So you felt lonely also?

193
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:31,990
-I felt very deep urge to search about god, about religion, meaning of life but I don’t

194
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:44,160
think that the suffering or the crisis led to it, I feel more that there was deep need to

195
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:49,340
go and really find a true answer about these questions.

196
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,250
Actually I still feel that.

197
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,320
And as well I must say that before entering in this group there was a lot of

198
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:11,680
self-destruction, a lot of alcohol…

199
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,580
-During which period?
-Before entering this group.

200
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,830
-At the age of 17?

201
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:29,650
-Yes, a lot of self-destruction with huge amount of alcohol until fainting even.

202
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,810
-Which you entered the religious group and you stopped all together.

203
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,130
And now you went to the army.

204
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:48,900
In the army how you felt psychologically?
-I felt very bad, more than terrible.

205
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,660
-Suppressed?

206
00:26:52,760 --> 00:27:03,620
-I felt fear as if I’m going to die, that people want to attack me and in army basically

207
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:12,050
this is what you face. When this commando coming to you doing all sorts of things

208
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:20,960
as if he wants to kill you, he puts a bomb near your ear after you are running for 16 hours,

209
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,020
putting this gun in your ear…

210
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,510
-You have problems.

211
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:43,080
- And I entered into the army with a lot of conflict and psychological unbalanced condition

212
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:49,480
because of this religion and change and internally many things happening all the time.

213
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,480
-It must have been a lot of anger inside you.

214
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:03,810
How you express this anger?
-I think it was more fear than anger.

215
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,580
-Fear of dying, fear of destroyed.

216
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:14,790
-Fear of many things, I felt all the time under attack and under something bad is

217
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:19,310
going to happen, I felt a lot of insecurity.

218
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:31,390
-You felt that everybody is enemy to you, you didn’t feel friendly.

219
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:43,570
-I can’t remember actually but you can say that, it doesn’t feel foreign to me what you are saying.

220
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:51,730
-Do you have a salivation during sleep? When you sleep there is saliva coming out?

221
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,400
-It used to be much more, right now it’s less.

222
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:03,790
-Have you ever taken Mercury?
-No. Maybe.

223
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:09,800
In Israel what happened is somebody gave me a few remedies, he gave

224
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:20,810
me two remedies, I don’t know which they were. The idea was that I’m an Aurum person

225
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:37,630
and I felt after taking this remedy that I became more weak, much weaker and then

226
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:42,730
I came in June to the seminar and everything collapsed.

227
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:59,710
-Yes, you came in a terrible state. Have you ever taken Staphysagria?

228
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:08,380
-I don’t think so. I didn’t take much remedies. I took only what you gave me and only

229
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,650
what that person gave me, which seems I was pretty much confused, I didn’t know what to do.

230
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:32,640
Concerning the inflammation in the scar area sometimes there is pinching pain after urination.

231
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:44,390
-Where is the pinching pain?
-In the sexual organs.

232
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:47,800
-In the testes or in the urethra?

233
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,970
-In the urethra. And as well sometimes after sexual intercourse there is this kind of

234
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,480
pinching pain.

235
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:16,900
-Do you have any fears now? What are your fears?

236
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:37,390
-Right now I can’t really see a specific fear because what I feel generally is that lots

237
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:44,730
of things, I motivated to do things which counteracted fears.

238
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:55,880
Let’s take this example at the moment I really wanted to receive interview from you

239
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,730
and you are so busy, so it’s impossible.

240
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:07,880
So somehow this thing of coming right now in front of all the class for me it’s a fearful

241
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:16,320
thing to expose myself like this but I will do it to counteract the fear.

242
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,880
And as well like this, I found many situations in my life, which I did it because there was

243
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,980
a fear behind and I did it to counteract the fear.

244
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:36,050
Many situations which I did in my life behind there was a fear which I needed to overcome,

245
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:37,400
to do the opposite.

246
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:42,740
-Fear of dark you have?
-Not much.

247
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,130
But maybe yes I can’t really say because whenever I’m having fear there is immediate tendency

248
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,070
to go and to counteract it.

249
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:59,210
I remember myself at the age of 20-21 to go into a total dark room to see how I feel with this.

250
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:04,380
I stayed to a totally dark room for half an hour, to see if the devil will come to

251
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,770
eat me but he didn’t.

252
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,180
-You had fear of devil by that time?
-No.

253
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:24,650
Basically more specific fear is fear for the future, what will be, what will happen

254
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:31,320
with me, how shall I manage, no money, more about the future.

255
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,510
-You feel more weak in the morning or the noon or afternoon?

256
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:14,250
-I can’t really say. Sometimes after stool there is some dizziness and weakness.

257
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:24,420
That thing is before of the effort, the constipation is very dry.

258
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:29,670
As well there is this symptom of bloating stomach, especially in the evening.

259
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,570
-What time?

260
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:37,740
-I can’t say, if there is constipation, there is aggravation, if the stomach is empty

261
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:47,270
there is not and as well pain in the large intestine.

262
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:52,340
I actually feel the large intestine as if there is separation from the body.

263
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:59,490
I feel the large intestine very painful, as well sometimes I feel the stomach very painful

264
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:02,010
as if there is a knife inside.

265
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:13,420
-Do you have problems with you gums, bleeding gums?

266
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:22,340
-Sometimes.
-What about your smell?

267
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:30,570
-Not too much but my girlfriend is saying that basically when there is constipation

268
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,590
there is more bad smell, otherwise it’s OK.

269
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,580
-Do you perspire?

270
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:51,490
-When I was younger I used to be so hot in the body, so I used to sweat all the time

271
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:54,420
but not it’s basically normal.

272
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,120
-You prefer cold or warm weather?

273
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:14,080
-When I was younger, I used to be very hot person. I used to go in the rain with a bathing suit

274
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:20,170
to wash myself in the rain, in the winter because I was very hot.

275
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:27,660
But right now it seems that it’s gone upside down and I have a small shivering of cold wind,

276
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:39,580
every climate change.Especially when it’s from warm to cold, sneezing, coughing, running nose…

277
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,740
-Affected in the change of weather.

278
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:54,060
-The last few years I’m travelling a lot and I see that every climate change, especially

279
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,820
to cold, immediately I’m becoming sick.

280
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:01,800
-Do you grind your teeth in night?
–No.

281
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,490
-What is your age now?
-29.

282
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,570
-Do you have any special desire for food?

283
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:39,310
-Yes, a lot of sweets, many chocolates. Sweets but many chocolates and the main pattern which

284
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:45,550
I can tell you about food habits and that’s as well in the emotional processes,

285
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:55,890
basically this pattern I see coming across all my life, is a tendency for being extreme,

286
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,650
being tremendously extreme.

287
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,350
-One way or another.

288
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:07,140
-One week only cheese, one week only chocolate, one week only meat, milk product

289
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,410
it’ s coming as waves.

290
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:21,740
-Your life also is like that, going from alcoholism to religious and back and forward.

291
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:30,300
-Yes, yes. The pattern to be extreme is pretty much. The last two years I’m becoming

292
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:42,320
more moderate actually but the tendency is to be extreme.

293
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:52,140
-Do you wake up refreshed or unrefreshed in the morning?

294
00:38:52,240 --> 00:39:04,390
-For long time I felt this unrefreshed in the morning and something else which I need to say,

295
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:08,060
I think it’s important is this.

296
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,820
When I was born and I was one year old my father died.

297
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:27,060
When my mother was 5 month pregnant with me, her father died and then when I was 1 year old,

298
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,640
my mother’s husband died, my father died.

299
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:40,310
So basically this time of pregnancy something with death all over, the atmosphere of insecurity

300
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:44,820
and death and being abandoned and all that.

301
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:52,990
And my mother faced tremendous emotional crisis when her husband died.

302
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,820
-From what died your father, do you know?

303
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:06,890
-At that time the border was near the kibbutz where I lived and every man received

304
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:15,400
a gun and nobody really know, it might be a suicide, it might be an accident.

305
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:19,910
There was two bullets entered into the heart while he was cleaning the gun.

306
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:25,630
But nobody knows, a few people investigated that and they can’t come to conclusion

307
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,820
if he committed suicide or if he died from accident.

308
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:40,400
I became really curious about it and at the age of 14-17 I investigated almost everybody who knew him

309
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:47,060
and some people say it’s impossible to be a suicide because at that time he reached

310
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,650
the peak of his life.

311
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,500
But I can’t really be sure about this, maybe it was a suicide.

312
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:59,510
-What was his profession?
-He had no profession.

313
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:06,340
He was kibbutz member. He used to be very strong man.

314
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:17,500
He used to be tremendously strong man which survived a terrible thing in the Holocaust.

315
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:29,590
He was a person which his mother in the train to the concentration camp knew that he will die.

316
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:34,150
At that time he was two years old and she knew that he will die in the concentration camp,

317
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:39,790
so while going in the train to the camp, she threw him out of the train.

318
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:47,570
Nobody knows how but he managed to survive from 2-6 years old in the forest in Poland by himself,

319
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:55,740
like a wolf boy and later on when she came out of Auschwitz she went back to the same area where

320
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,910
she threw him out and she found him in the woods.

321
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:07,330
She knew him by a scar on the head which he had and as well by some schema in the knee,

322
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,680
like a birth mark.

323
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,020
-And he grew to be very strong man.

324
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:18,850
-He survived this forest and later on when she found him, my grandmother, his mother

325
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:24,920
she was completely mad because of this concentration camp and he was

326
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,160
as well completely wild.

327
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:33,660
She used to beat him with a stick for hours and somehow, I don’t know how, he managed

328
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:41,170
to survive that as well, her madness and learn to speak, learn to communicate.

329
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:50,410
But he had this kind of psychological pattern who is very quite, very good to people

330
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:56,490
very loving to people but suddenly without any visual cause he was becoming volcano

331
00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:00,770
of violence. This is what people told me.

332
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:21,520
-Do you have any impulses inside you that you want to do something violent some time?

333
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:34,420
-Yes, I never expressed it. Only with very rare situations which were life-threatening

334
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:40,250
I become violent. It was a few times in my life where my life was under real threat

335
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:49,930
that time I become, surprising myself, I become very violent.

336
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:56,500
But without this coincidence I never express violent although some time there is

337
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,850
inside a wave…

338
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,830
-But you have to control it.

339
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:08,100
-A wave like a storm to destroy everything which is around me, taking the table…

340
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:20,860
Not to kill somebody, just a storm of violence to destroy the world.

341
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:23,380
-This comes suddenly.

342
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,210
OK good case, now I have more idea.

343
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:22,560
-We have to analyze this very interesting case of these dramatic changes.

344
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:36,880
From a point of view is interesting because we have been talking about this new spirit

345
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:46,040
which is developing in the planet, which is exemplified exactly in that case and how the

346
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:53,240
conflict in this level takes away the energy.

347
00:45:53,730 --> 00:46:01,710
It is very interesting also and I have to point out to this fact that whenever you have a

348
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:08,560
big conflict inside you, you have loss of energy.

349
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:19,210
The energy is taking so much by the conflict that really you may see flat energy in the individual.

350
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:32,560
So it is very important to have clear targets, what we want to do.

351
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:43,400
If we doubt and our society is a doubting society, we doubt everything, we doubt

352
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:51,930
everybody, we doubt whether this or not, we accept that this maybe so or maybe the

353
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:58,950
opposite and this brings us in a state of lack of energy.

354
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,110
Who wants to speak about the case?

355
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:24,960
Did you see at all the repertorization? Please.

356
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:36,190
Who wants to speak about the case?

357
00:47:45,690 --> 00:48:06,760
There is something from the case, lots of gas in the abdomen, bloated very much a pain like knife

358
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:34,690
in stomach, desire sweets, chocolate, aversion to green pepper very good appetite.

359
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:44,940
I have to give you a little bit feedback because he said that I treated him before

360
00:48:45,450 --> 00:49:00,680
he was here in June, in the course and the moment that he arrived he called me

361
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:05,620
and I went to see him because he was in a very bad state.

362
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:20,930
He had very high fever around 40, tremendous headache, tremendous exhaustion.

363
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:29,120
He said, I can’t pick up the water. He had constant diarrhea and vomiting.

364
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:44,010
I said, what is this? What happened? He said, two weeks ago, test my memory

365
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:48,450
because I say all this by heart, it was a few months ago.

366
00:49:50,200 --> 00:50:00,180
He said, two weeks ago I started with some influenza and then it became a pneumonia

367
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,940
I tried to treat it homeopathically, somebody prescribed for him, it didn’t succeed

368
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,270
eventually he had to take antibiotics.

369
00:50:08,370 --> 00:50:15,940
He took antibiotics, the original bronchopneumonia subsided and then for a while

370
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:21,520
he was in between with some diarrhea. Then the diarrhea started with vomiting and

371
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:29,040
high fever and there he was lying for the third week in that exhausting condition.

372
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:51,270
So the pain in the head was absolutely unbearable, the exhaustion was tremendous the head was

373
00:50:51,370 --> 00:51:08,120
very hot, the feet were rather cold and the remedy I prescribed was Belladonna 10M.

374
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:36,690
He took the Belladonna 10M and the next day the fever was practically gone,

375
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:40,710
the headache was much less, the exhaustion continued.

376
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:53,100
I don’t remember the thirst, do you remember the thirst?

377
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,350
I don’t think he remembers himself the symptoms. Do you remember if you had thirst?

378
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:10,600
No thirst but it looked really precarious condition because it looked to me very much

379
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,540
like a typhoid fever.

380
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:22,280
With the diarrhea, the vomiting, the headache, the exhaustion looked like typhoid fever

381
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:31,700
and Belladonna picked up the whole situation.

382
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:41,850
If I remember well the next day or the day after the next, I completed the action with

383
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:53,850
Calc. carb. 1M and in 2 ½ days the whole thing was subsided, he was in the class

384
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,370
sitting there, attending the class.

385
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:17,180
Then he said to me while he was leaving, I have this loss of semen while having a stool

386
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,370
I still have exhaustion.

387
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:28,770
I said to him try a dose of Selenium with these two symptoms because Selenium has this symptom.

388
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:34,370
I do not know why we were not able to find it.

389
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:40,450
Has anybody found this symptom in Kent’s Repertory?

390
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,070
-Prostate fluid.

391
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:17,540
-In the Repertory is under pollutions after stool, that’s where it is.

392
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,360
-Are you sure?

393
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:38,320
-Yes of course, pollutions after stool. Can I speak about the case?

394
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,800
He mentioned about traveling so maybe it is interesting to know where he traveled

395
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:55,720
because of infections agents and all that. First hearing the case we hear about the

396
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:02,820
operation and the scar and the pain and it sounds like Staphysagria to begin with.

397
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:10,710
Then you hear the underline maybe there is some anger, violence and then we have

398
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:17,970
to think about other remedy and Staphysagria comes up under pollutions after

399
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:21,480
difficult stool which he said.

400
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,560
It’s really when he is actually straining …

401
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:41,630
-Yes it is correct what he is saying. When you have a scar and the scar keeps on

402
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:48,800
paining years after the operation and especially the way that he described it.

403
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:56,310
As if I’m operated all the time there, that is a symptom of Staphysagria.

404
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:13,150
With his suppression of feelings, you may have a case of Staphysagria.

405
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:25,970
Carbo Vegetabilis comes first, then Alumina, you remember the strong constipation

406
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:35,820
with hard stool, then Mercury, then Silica and Nitric acid, Lachesis, Staphysagria…

407
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:25,650
If you put pain after stool, underline it more, 3 times to see if it changes.

408
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:54,640
You see Selenium comes very strongly in pollution during stool.

409
00:57:54,740 --> 00:58:02,650
Selenium is very strong whether it is prostatic fluid or it is seminal.

410
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:16,300
-I think we have to differentiate between pollutions or ejaculations, which is usually

411
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:23,380
connected with orgasm or seminal discharge and between emission of prostatic

412
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:28,720
fluid because I think this has to do more with the prostatic gland.

413
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:35,960
So for me the right rubric should be prostate, emissions, stool during.

414
00:58:36,060 --> 00:59:02,470
-Wait a moment. He says that it looks like sperm. It is not very clear whether it is

415
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:11,820
purely prostatic fluid or it is seminal or a mixture of both.

416
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:17,490
Whatever you take more or less the same remedies are there.

417
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:29,650
Alumina comes first, Carbo vegetabilis, Silica, Mercury, Sulphur, Lachesis.

418
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:40,320
Does anybody wants to talk? I will give you some more information about him.

419
00:59:55,740 --> 01:00:04,970
Another symptom which he forgot to say is that he is covered totally by the blanket,

420
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:09,070
he covers all his head and only his mouth…

421
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:20,740
Salivation he said he had in the past quite a lot but now it’s less.

422
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:33,570
Now suppressed, he said, I’m not sure I have suppressed myself but we can argue about that.

423
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:52,390
Make clear to us whether you feel now cold more or heat more or both extremes you

424
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:56,390
don’t like or what exactly?

425
01:00:56,490 --> 01:01:03,800
-Generally I’m more a hot person, quick to sweat a lot but if there is a quick change from

426
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:13,640
hot to cold I receive running nose, coughing, sneezing but the nature of the body is to

427
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,740
be very hot.

428
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:41,060
-George about the operations is under generalities injuries operation ailments from

429
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,570
and Staphysagria is the only bold remedy.

430
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:59,690
-I also thought about it and I had the feeling that in him a strong change had taken place.

431
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:09,470
A kind of suppression where I had the feeling that he used to be hot, now he has

432
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:15,970
problems with warm and cold, he used to perspire a lot, now he does not perspire a lot anymore,

433
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:21,390
then there is the issue of covering completely during night, weakness after stool,

434
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:27,900
more salivation was there before and now it’s kind of suppressed. So I really like

435
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,390
the idea of Mercury very much.

436
01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:39,070
He also has a kind of violence and he is very sensitive to outer impressions and with Mercury

437
01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:42,490
you always have to look for suppressions in the past.

438
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:51,310
Also during the time when everything changed for him, he constantly had this idea of

439
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:59,830
being attacked and that is Mercury, even though Stramonium has this too.

440
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:05,320
-That’s very good, I can not translate of course, it’s too much.

441
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:16,140
He says, for me the idea of Mercury is strong because of several things.

442
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:25,640
One is salivation, the second thing is that he is worse in changes of weather, he is

443
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:33,630
suppressed in his emotions, there is some violence inside and there is some violent

444
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,900
impulses, which he described.

445
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:47,070
But he said something which is very interesting and you did not pay attention.

446
01:03:47,850 --> 01:04:01,990
That, he said, he felt everybody was attacking him. That is also a sign of Mercury.

447
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:09,380
So he has the signs of Mercury. Before the salivation was even more.

448
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:16,400
The changes of weather, they are sensitive to changes of weather, Mercury.

449
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:38,880
They do not show the violence. Mercury have impulses inside them and impulses to do

450
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:46,800
some violent things, to throw things, to kill, to do some violent things. Though he did not

451
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:53,470
admit he wants really to kill but there are impulses sometimes they just want to destroy

452
01:04:53,570 --> 01:05:06,870
everything in the room. This, combined with the idea of enemies, feels everybody is his

453
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:17,870
enemy or is attacked by everyone; that gives us the idea of Mercury at least at the age

454
01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:27,200
around 17,18 when he started having this, when the salivation was more.

455
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:32,050
What age the salivation was more?

456
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:37,380
-George first of all I must say something about another thing.

457
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,950
Because in my life history there is some background of the Holocaust, I must say

458
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:48,940
because of our own group that from my side there is no any point of accusation or

459
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:56,780
something of this nature against German people. It’s totally clean. So I wanted to be

460
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:05,200
clear about that. Concerning your question maybe salivation used to be a lot at the age

461
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:19,030
of 6,7,8 and as well 17,18 but it comes in waves. Sometimes there is a lot, sometimes

462
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:20,800
there is not too much.

463
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:38,150
-Also the moment he said he became introvert, he couldn’t communicate very much and

464
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:47,920
he had to express himself by different arts he was doing, that is another point.

465
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:58,910
Why don’t we go to Alumina? Because he does not show the mentality of Alumina, the slowness,

466
01:06:59,010 --> 01:07:07,900
he answers very precisely. He did not do this. That’s why we do not go to Alumina.

467
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,660
Why do we not go to Silica?

468
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:25,490
Because in Silica we need to see the worse from cold very much but I would like to see now

469
01:07:25,590 --> 01:07:36,150
because we added this element, which is strong for Staphysagria, we added in the repertorization

470
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:40,920
and I would like to show the analysis.

471
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:50,000
Ailments from operations, injuries from operations.

472
01:07:55,750 --> 01:08:07,000
The analysis shows Nitric acid, Mercury, Alumina…

473
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:17,670
So Mercury remained in 4th place with Nitric acid on the first place.

474
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:29,670
We do some Materia Medica, one more remedy. What is the next?

475
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:41,180
That’s Mercury. It’s good that we have to talk about Mercury.

476
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:51,730
Excessive salivation, metallic taste and offensive breath are 3 symptoms that if you find

477
01:08:51,830 --> 01:08:59,500
is Mercury. In his case we do not have the metallic taste.

478
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:03,660
Do you have metallic taste ever?
-Yes, there is.

479
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:05,340
-It may be.

480
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:30,830
So we have aphthae, gums are bleeding, profused perspiration with every complain

481
01:09:30,930 --> 01:09:34,340
but not only does not relieve, it also aggravates the patient.

482
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:42,270
Now this is another point in which you have to ask to confirm Mercury.

483
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:55,100
Perspiration? Can you tell?

484
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:15,920
So he confirms that point also. Great weakness of course. Pains are worse at night,

485
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:29,920
worse both extremes of temperature, rapidly spread in ulcers but I do not put here

486
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:34,170
anything about the mental-emotional state of Mercury.

487
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:40,270
So we shall be talking a little bit about the mental-emotional state of Mercury.

488
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:55,590
Mercury is unpredictable. He can go this way or that way, he can go very fast up,

489
01:10:55,690 --> 01:11:05,530
very fast down. You see how unpredictable is when you try to hold the Mercury?

490
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:26,420
It will go, so it can go both extremes. It’s really a remedy which has a lot of anger

491
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:35,850
inside and becomes introverted once they are hurt.

492
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:46,920
Once they are hurt they close inside and they live only with their inner feelings and

493
01:11:47,020 --> 01:12:02,840
thoughts. They do not want to share things and that’s why they feel threatened by the

494
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:11,930
environment because the support group, everybody has a support team, the support

495
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:19,420
team around is broken down. So they come to the point where they feel that they are

496
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:27,170
threatened very much by outside people. They are so much threatened that they can

497
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:33,520
reach even a delusion that everybody wants to do harm to them.

498
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:44,600
This is a reason why also they cannot express their emotions and because they can not

499
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:48,940
express their emotions, they start stammering.

500
01:12:53,950 --> 01:13:01,850
And I said stammering with Mercury is a sweet stammering, it’s not an aggressive stammering.

501
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:28,170
But the most interesting thing for the mental picture of Mercury is that this aggression that

502
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:36,700
has been kept inside it comes in waves as impulses to do violent things.

503
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:48,670
Suddenly it comes a wave that … and he described exactly that there comes a wave

504
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:52,680
and I just want to destroy everything.

505
01:13:52,780 --> 01:14:01,670
And I want to do some violence and so much strong is this that sometimes they say I

506
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:14,510
need to go out almost and shout. They try to keep themselves not to shout, not to do

507
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:23,170
violence and there is a constant struggle, violence comes from inside and then the struggle

508
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:25,200
not to show it.

509
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:54,510
In this case, apart from the symptoms which Mercury has, he has these core feelings

510
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:59,060
of Mercury, the impulses to do violence but he has to resist.

511
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:12,680
And maybe one time or another when he feels secure, then if you put here, one more

512
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:19,120
symptom like feels everybody is his enemy, Mercury will shoot up.

513
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:24,360
Do you want me to show you how in this Repertory, if you put the right symptom, you will

514
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:34,430
get immediately Mercury first. I will tell her to do that to show you that of course

515
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:39,180
repertorisation depends on what you are taking for repertorisation.

516
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:48,530
And then if you take impulses, then again Mercury will be.

517
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:55,920
-How about the scars, the operation that he had and the pain.

518
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,960
It doesn’t mention anything in Mercury about this.

519
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:00,710
-No, Mercury does not have that symptom.

520
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:02,970
-So would you ignore it when you prescribe?

521
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:10,880
-I would ignore it for the time being and maybe later on if that symptom remains,

522
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:17,960
maybe a Staphysagria can come as second. You could actually give first Staphysagria and

523
01:16:18,060 --> 01:16:27,630
then Mercury but I see now that the Mercury symptoms are much more strong and over whelm

524
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:29,730
the idea of Staphysagria.

525
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:42,710
And it has really the history of Mercury symptoms. In the past also he has the Mercury

526
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:50,210
symptoms. So Mercury is running through from a period onwards. So maybe Mercury will

527
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:57,570
bring back all his lost energy and will cure all his physical problems.

528
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:17,300
Mercury you see he has the constipation, the cicatrices, salivation in the night, weakness

529
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:24,220
after stool, cutting pain, change of weather aggravates, desire for sweets, unrefreshing

530
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:30,570
sleep, pain stool, injuries operation.

531
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,130
-We didn’t put any mind symptoms.

532
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:38,150
-OK, just put one mind symptom. I will tell you.

533
01:17:54,400 --> 01:18:09,300
They have programmed my thinking. It’s very obvious, if you take the right symptom.

534
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:17,800
Even if not taking the right symptoms, Mercury would come fourth, third, so you could

535
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:23,820
get the idea that somewhere there is Mercury. And then you go back…

536
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:38,210
Then the suppression, the impulses, Mercury feels unprotected, the defense mechanism

537
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:47,460
is weak. That’s why the ulcers are spreading. There is an ulcer and the mechanism

538
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:53,300
instead of making the ulcer smaller and smaller, it allows the ulcer to be bigger and

539
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:59,740
bigger. There is no power behind the defense mechanism.

540
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:06,910
You see the weakness and the trembling because of the weakness.

541
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:14,650
The trembling and Mercury is one of the main remedies for Parkinson.

542
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:19,240
Hands are trembling, legs are trembling.

543
01:19:30,230 --> 01:19:37,390
Now he gave me his case the other day, just superficially like that and I was thinking

544
01:19:37,490 --> 01:19:43,460
some remedies but never Mercury. I was thinking some remedies but I was not happy.

545
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,740
I said I cannot give the remedy, I will give him the wrong remedy.

546
01:19:51,490 --> 01:19:58,480
And really you have to put together the symptoms because there is also the possibility

547
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:07,220
of Alumina, of Silica, of Bryonia, Stramonium, Staphysagria, all these possibilities are

548
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:15,310
there but what is the right remedy that will make the trick. That will free, will take him out

549
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:18,490
of the jail. He is in a jail now.

550
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:27,740
-The search of religion and god… in his life?

551
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:39,050
-Yes. You don’t take now this religious. You can but it is not really religious, he is not

552
01:20:39,150 --> 01:20:43,650
religious at this moment, with the meaning of religious.

553
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:53,950
He has been but with the despair through which he was going at the time he met the

554
01:20:54,050 --> 01:21:03,700
religious group. Bring yourself to that situation where you don’t have a house, the kibbutz

555
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:11,620
is finished, they sent you away, he said they told him you just go away, you have no

556
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:19,040
money and then you meet these people who like to support you, to give you some love,

557
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:26,550
some affection and all that. You believe and you follow because it’s a matter of survival.

558
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:34,710
Is this a matter of religious? Yes but his character being this character what he is, he

559
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:45,140
goes full speed but then he goes away, he swings on the other side, like a pendulum.

560
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:55,210
Too much heat and goes to the other way, I don’t like it, I go away from it, too much cold

561
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:59,890
I run away, this is the idea of Mercury.

562
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:07,310
Put a lot of heat and it goes away, put a lot of cold and it goes away.

563
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:19,060
-Where would you put this much travelling that he mentioned that he likes it very much.

564
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:33,540
-I’m not sure really that it is a pathological desire for travelling, I’m not sure but we can

565
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:42,050
investigate and see whether it is really desire to travel.

566
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:47,390
He goes to one place and then he has to go to another. Can you tell us?

567
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:08,560
-Basically I love travelling but I don’t see travelling as a solution to solve the problems.

568
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:14,290
If I could, I would have it for few more years but I don’t see it as something which is

569
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:17,230
solving any problem which I need to run away.

570
01:23:21,810 --> 01:23:33,210
-I will tell you something. In 1970 in Athens we met a woman who looked at our hands to

571
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:41,960
me and my wife. So the woman said to me, my god you are going to travel so much and

572
01:23:42,060 --> 01:24:01,710
my wife said, fantastic I like it so much. I said to her, the day will come where you will

573
01:24:01,810 --> 01:24:08,560
say, I had enough, I don’t want to travel. I mean you ask her now if she likes to travel.

574
01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:17,210
Not anymore. Actually travelling is liked by everybody because you see new experiences

575
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:26,380
but to be pathology, that means I travel and I can not resist. I have to pick up my

576
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:33,790
luggages and go, I’m happy. Calcarea phos. for another reason as we said,

577
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:41,320
Tuberculinum for another reason etc. Is this his situation? Maybe he can tell.

578
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:50,630
-What I feel more to travel is because I like the dynamic. If I stay in my place for a long

579
01:24:50,730 --> 01:25:01,460
time the boredom just makes me mad. I need a very dramatic activity. I can’t stay for long

580
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,210
to one place.

581
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:17,450
-What he says now is a tinge of tuberculosis. We have an idea of Tuberculinum but not

582
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:20,640
other symptoms of Tuberculinum at the moment.

583
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:24,630
We give a lecture on Mercury.

584
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:32,440
-I would like to ask some questions about another remedy which came to my mind and

585
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:40,360
this is Sulphur because he has many 3rd degree symptoms and 2d degree symptoms of

586
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:47,050
Sulphur. For me I have chosen several rubrics…

587
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:52,550
-No, no, it’s not correct what you are saying.

588
01:25:54,290 --> 01:26:00,950
-I have chosen several rubrics, I want to tell them to you so that you say whether they

589
01:26:01,050 --> 01:26:02,610
are correct or not.

590
01:26:02,710 --> 01:26:04,370
-All right.

591
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:10,530
-We know that he has hernia since childhood.

592
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:13,960
-Nux vomica, Lycopodium, not Sulphur.

593
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:21,280
-Hernia since childhood in Repertory is Sulphur. Then we have prostate discharge

594
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:27,560
during stool, which is again Sulphur. We have constipation with dry stool, which is

595
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:36,390
again Sulphur. We have weakness stool after, which is again Sulphur.

596
01:26:36,490 --> 01:26:46,640
We have this philosophical and theorizing theme in him because its mental symptom

597
01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:56,810
he says yes, but I know it’s very good for myself and then we have this tendency to

598
01:26:56,910 --> 01:27:05,470
alcohol, which again is connected to Sulphur and we have abdomen distention

599
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:12,980
evening, which he confirmed and is again Sulphur 2d degree and we have the heat

600
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:20,240
he is rather hot. I don’t have the impression that he is very much sensitive to

601
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:26,810
extremes of hot and cold and I’m not sure whether the symptoms of delusion

602
01:27:26,910 --> 01:27:34,470
everybody is an enemy is still existing and whether the desire for sweet is not pointing

603
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:41,390
more towards Sulphur. So I would say that we have reasons to investigate in this

604
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:45,070
direction, Sulphur and with hints of Tuberculinum.

605
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:49,580
And there is something else that I would like to say, if I can.

606
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:57,720
In this case I see that we have a lot of work to do, not only through Homeopathy but

607
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:05,060
through other source of healing, as well. I think this guy has ruined his health because

608
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:07,820
he has not paid enough attention to his way of living.

609
01:28:12,670 --> 01:28:16,410
-I’ll tell you Peter, you may need Sulphur!

610
01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:41,100
This is theorizing. Not him, what he did is not theorizing. He is stuck on facts actually

611
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:50,930
hard facts. We agree in the other things except of theorizing and I also agree that you

612
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:57,950
might entering a state of Sulphur, which maybe a good idea actually.

613
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:11,610
Have you taken Sulphur before? Now? Oh, you are a proving!

614
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:24,780
-Not yet. I took Sulphur 2-3 years before, the last time.

615
01:29:27,110 --> 01:29:31,940
-Not lately?
-No.

616
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:56,280
-Wait, we may have a very good idea of Sulphur.

617
01:30:00,860 --> 01:30:12,440
The prescription for this case is Mercury and the possibility of Staphysagria, later on.

618
01:30:17,370 --> 01:30:26,510
-I would like to ask if we take this pressure in the time of army, as a trigger point?

619
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:31,200
Because now it is not anymore there.

620
01:30:33,450 --> 01:30:36,780
Is it?
-No.

621
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:44,610
-I mean have we taken this as a trigger, as an exciting cause?
-No.

622
01:30:46,030 --> 01:30:56,680
-So why did you take this as a symptom? I mean the feeling of enemies was only in the army.

623
01:30:56,780 --> 01:31:02,420
-If the feeling of enemies is still there? I don’t know, we can ask him.

624
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:09,600
-How he said it? Not everybody is an enemy but everybody can be not my side but

625
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:19,180
against me. This is the idea. When we speak about a symptom, I said a symptom has

626
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:25,670
stages. It starts from this and then goes to there, goes to there and then you may even

627
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:31,350
reach the point where he feels everybody is the enemy but we don’t have the other

628
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:37,610
stages. That’s why I took this to show you. Because this tends towards that direction.

629
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:49,950
-Can we get problems with a special potency of Mercury?

630
01:31:50,450 --> 01:31:56,180
Can we give low potencies or highs, maybe because of problems with that?

631
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:06,860
-In this case, because he is a young man, his basic constitution is strong, I will give

632
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:15,780
a high potency, one time a high potency like 10M or 50M Mercury.

633
01:32:18,110 --> 01:32:26,180
With most probably a reaction. Some pains will be there developing for a week or so

634
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:31,110
and then the amelioration will start, will ease off.

635
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:50,510
So it was synchronized with the Mercury. It was very strange that we arrived at that point

636
01:32:50,610 --> 01:33:00,020
and we had the opportunity to analyze, in a live subject, the case of Mercury.

637
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,780
-What about the aphthae?

638
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:28,700
-Aphthea in the mouth? He does not have.
-I can’t understand.

639
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:32,620
-He can’t understand. That’s why you are here.

640
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:43,530
-George I would like to confirm these wounds in the mouth, these aphthea which appear sa lot.

641
01:33:52,780 --> 01:34:02,120
-This will teach you something. We made a good lesson with him.

642
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:07,280
It’s very interesting because he said to me, where are the aphthae?

643
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:15,600
I said, he doesn’t have it, it doesn’t matter. So he said, this is what I say

644
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:21,530
I don’t understand and then he comes and say, I forgot something, I have a lot of aphthea.

645
01:34:26,610 --> 01:34:34,270
What it means is, it does not matter. Once you have the essential things, the others

646
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:37,620
are details, he may not have it.

647
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:50,180
-As well there is a teeth mark on the tongue, because I’m dealing with Chinese Medicine.

648
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:54,370
In Chinese Medicine they make diagnosis, so my tongue is full of tooth marks.

649
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:58,950
-That’s terrible.

650
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:23,000
-Because it’s a clear remedy can you come to conclusion that (?)

651
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:25,530
I’m on a high place or low place?

652
01:35:29,030 --> 01:35:38,850
-Well, not bad. You may feel rotten with all these, you may feel totally degenerated but

653
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:42,940
you will see after Mercury your health will start developing back.

654
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:55,540
-I have an elderly patient with Parkinson disease but who has all symptoms of Mercury.

655
01:35:56,230 --> 01:35:59,110
How high may I go with potency?

656
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:24,180
-Not high. It’s better with Parkinson you start with low potency, like 12X or 12D.

657
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:43,280
In German you call it Decimal. It’s also the mark for 10, in Latin this is 10.

658
01:36:44,060 --> 01:37:03,280
Decimal is 1 in 10, 1/10 in the 12th, instead of 1/100 to 12th which equals to C.

659
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:18,940
In Germany you call it D30, D12.

660
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:43,940
That indicates the dilution that is 1 in 10 where centesimal means 1 in 100.

661
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:52,930
CH Hahnemannian it means that the remedy is diluted 1 to a 100, but out of this

662
01:37:53,030 --> 01:38:03,200
dilution one drop is taken in another bottle and again another into 99 drops.

663
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:14,780
So you have in CH dilutions, you have change of bottles. That means one bottle

664
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,360
another bottle, another bottle, 10.000 bottles.

665
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:30,840
Where Korsakov you empty the bottle and you refill it and then you go on

666
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:33,280
emptying, refilling, emptying, refilling…

667
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,280
We always leave unfinished some lesson.
