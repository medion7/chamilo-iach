1
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:33,160
You took a remedy 1 year ago.
-No in May.

2
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:42,270
-You took a remedy in May. What was the remedy?
-Ignatia 50M.

3
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:51,930
-OK, how are you doing?
-Now I’m well but I wasn’t...

4
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:58,920
After coming home I was very bad but it started the day I got the remedy

5
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:16,230
I felt a kind of waving feeling in my head. That was the same day or evening.

6
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:23,890
On Wednesday I had a profused perspiration, especially on my forehead,

7
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,320
on my palms and on my feet.

8
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:33,390
I was crying a lot in the evening.

9
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,470
-For no reason? You just remembered something?

10
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:46,720
-No, it just came on, I felt a bit sad. So I went earlier, we were out eating

11
00:01:46,820 --> 00:02:00,670
and I went earlier back and by myself crying. I started to feel very tired.

12
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,560
-The same day?
-No, the day after the remedy.

13
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:15,140
The next day there were two small blisters on the left side of my upper lip,

14
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:25,250
there was pressure in both eyes and some pressure in the side of my head.

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
In the occiput, in the back side.

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,230
I didn’t notice it myself but the others said that I was drinking more water

17
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,980
than what I usually do. On Friday I was very hungry.

18
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:53,510
I ate a lot more than I usually do, I drink much water that day too,

19
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:02,650
my eyes get more severe (?) I had to close them during the lecture

20
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,870
because it was so (?) to hold them open.

21
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:16,110
-Like photophobia?
-More like a (?) as something was lying on …

22
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,460
-Something was lying on the conjunctiva.

23
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:42,710
-During the lecture I kept them closed. My menses started on Monday and that came on earlier.

24
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:56,610
-How much earlier? A few days?
-No, actually 2 and a half week I think.

25
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,800
Because I had it before I came down here.

26
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:13,450
But it stopped earlier than it used to do, so it was very profused those days,

27
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,550
it went on but it stopped earlier.

28
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,530
This was the most acute…

29
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,500
-Aggravation.

30
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:40,860
-Yes, I also had some restlessness in my back and legs

31
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:51,960
when I went on flying home I nearly sit still. My feet I had to move them all the time,

32
00:04:52,060 --> 00:05:06,630
I had to go from the seat and the legs felt a bit heavy while going upstairs, as very tired.

33
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:20,280
That went on. I got some kind of numbness in my legs and tightness.

34
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:28,230
But that was the day after I came back home.

35
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:36,120
I still had a hot burning feeling in my hands and feet that lasted all that day.

36
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:47,920
Burning feeling in hands and feet but not so much profused sweating, as I had earlier.

37
00:05:50,120 --> 00:06:05,770
The pain in my hips was bad when I sat down, the pain in my right knee was also worse

38
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:15,510
and I was still very restless. I was tired so I slept a lot.

39
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:22,770
Actually I slept all the day the second day after coming home.

40
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,190
-The day and the night.
-Yes.

41
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:39,600
The same evening when I got home, at half past seven I started with dizziness.

42
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:48,100
And the same kind of restlessness but I also start feeling a kind of fright.

43
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:57,020
I can’t exactly say there was something frightening me but I felt a kind of fright.

44
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:06,710
The day after (?) because then my stomach started.

45
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:15,050
It started stinking like ice in my stomach and every time I drunk cold water or eat something,

46
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:21,650
it was very severe. So I try not to eat so much.

47
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:30,720
-How many days after the remedy? 10 days after?

48
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:47,720
-7-8 days I think. On Sunday I woke up with a rumbling feeling in my stomach very much

49
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:55,960
that I’m not used to, still the sore feeling, like it was a sore.

50
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,900
-A wound.

51
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:12,380
-And the stitching like knife was still going. It was like stitches.

52
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:22,760
I got also some feeling of pain in Achilles tendons.

53
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:35,660
In afternoon I had very hard pressure on my head, still the pain on the occiput

54
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,520
and some pressure in the sides.

55
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:51,470
On the lower back, between the right shoulder and that has actually continued until now.

56
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,820
That kind of symptom. Otherwise the other symptoms are gone.

57
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:07,880
After a while I felt more calm and I’m still more calm but when I was going in here

58
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,800
I felt the same nervousness.

59
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,310
-Butterflies in the stomach.

60
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:23,900
-Yes butterflies in the stomach but I also slept more than usual.

61
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,630
Before the remedy I could wake up at 5, 6 o’ clock in the morning

62
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,130
and this summer I slept on Sundays when I’m free, I was not going to work,

63
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,550
I slept until 9, 10 o’clock and that I’ve never done it in my whole life.

64
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:58,380
So I sleep a lot more. Also I had a little period of going inside myself, I didn’t want to socialize

65
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:08,000
with others but that was for 14 days and when it went off, I felt good again.

66
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:17,590
-Did you cry at all after the first day?
-Yes. I’ve been more sensitive.

67
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,080
-More easily tears.

68
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:29,410
-Actually all my life I’ve been moved by seeing a (?) or something, my tears come easily

69
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:36,510
but crying in other situation has not been easy for me, but now it is.

70
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:47,260
Even when a patient does not have good results, I feel that the tears are coming up.

71
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,910
More easily to move.

72
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,650
-Tell me, you finished?

73
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:10,230
-In July I began to feel a little bit more nervous again. My stomach started a little bit

74
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:22,060
but not much, my eyes began to feel tired again but it stopped and right before I went down there

75
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,640
I also had these tired eyes a little bit.

76
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,480
-Did you drink coffee at all?
-I took some coffee in July?

77
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:37,810
-How many times?
-Actually I take half a cup of coffee in the morning.

78
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,810
-Every day?
-Yes.

79
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:48,810
-Ahh…
-When all the symptoms went away I thought maybe it’s …

80
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:54,390
-It’s time to start.
-That it wouldn’t touch.

81
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,750
-It wouldn’t affect you.

82
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:10,390
You must not drink coffee, if you want to stay well, for 3 years. It’s a bit difficult.

83
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:23,080
But remind me what was the main problem when you came here to be treated?

84
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:33,060
-I said it was a situation between my husband and me. I had a bad conscience

85
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,240
because I’ve been unfaithful.

86
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,150
-And you were upset emotionally a lot.
-Yes very much.

87
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:52,250
-That was the main problem, the emotional upset at the moment.

88
00:12:52,350 --> 00:13:02,850
-I felt very sad and guilty.

89
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:13,500
-But the stitches in the stomach, you had before?

90
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,350
-Not so severe. I felt the sorness but not the stitching never.

91
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:26,190
-Never?
-No that I can remember.

92
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,530
-Other symptoms that you had there original?

93
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:48,040
-The eyes I have had before, the restlessness in the legs also. I forgot something, I got ticks.

94
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,460
-Twitchings.

95
00:13:49,560 --> 00:14:00,810
-Yes and it was going all the time when the other symptoms went on for 14 days, I think.

96
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,420
-But how do you feel in general?
-I feel better.

97
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:20,660
-How much better? What would you say? Let me ask you before you answer.

98
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:27,490
You started drinking coffee when? In the middle of July or in the end of July?

99
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:37,000
-In the middle I think because I went to a course in Sweden and there I took some coffee.

100
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:52,100
-What was your best period between May and now? Psychologically?

101
00:14:52,200 --> 00:15:01,450
-When the most severe physical problems went better.

102
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,860
-Subside, then you felt better. That means by the end of May?

103
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:11,120
-Yes. End of May, begin of June.

104
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:20,850
-And it was a good period psychologically also but after drinking coffee you don’t find

105
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,870
that some of the symptoms are coming back now?

106
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:37,110
-Really I can’t tell if it’s because of coffee.
-No, no I don’t say because of the coffee.

107
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:44,690
I say, do you find some of your symptoms coming back the last month in September?

108
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,950
-I got a cold and then they started again.

109
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,770
-The eyes started being heavy?
–Yes.

110
00:15:51,870 --> 00:16:04,610
-I see you are sighing, it’s because you are here or you do it also outside?

111
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:12,380
-I don’t notice it myself. You told me the last time that I was sighing a lot.

112
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,970
-You don’t notice. Did you notice it here?
-No.

113
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,810
-Because you had some anxiety. Now you are more calm but in the beginning

114
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:31,110
when you started telling your case, you felt anxious and you were doing like this.

115
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:41,710
-I do that sometimes but I don’t notice it so much.

116
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:11,700
-You also have said that you had apathy, without any joy. Now it has come back?

117
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,280
You enjoy life?

118
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:22,700
-Yes I feel more calm and relaxed. I can talk easier with other people.

119
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:29,280
I think it made me more cheerful.

120
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:39,360
-Do you eat fruits? You like fruits?
-I seldom eat it.

121
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:52,440
Once every 14 days, bananas I eat but other fruits not so much.

122
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,450
But I actually I’ve been drinking fruit juices and that something I never drink either.

123
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,530
-What position do you sleep? You sleep on your back or now you change?

124
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:24,690
-I sleep on my back but I noticed I can wake up on the sides that I have not done for long time.

125
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:28,190
I actually had some pain in my back, when I was younger,

126
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:39,440
and my chiropractor told me to lie on my back. But before that I laid on my stomach always.

127
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:43,300
-And now you turn back to your stomach?

128
00:18:52,040 --> 00:19:03,380
-Also you said you did not like sweets? Still you don’t like or you start liking more sweets?

129
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:14,430
-I didn’t eat yogurt with honey the last time I was here but now I’m eating it.

130
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,890
I don’t know if that’s a sign.

131
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:23,760
-Also you have said that you desire always warm food.

132
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,750
-Yes more than cold.

133
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:30,000
-The water must be cold or room temperature?

134
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:40,190
-Earlier the water had to be room temperature but now I can take from the refrigerator and drink it.

135
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:50,190
-Also you had pains during menses in the abdomen? Now how is the menstrual period?

136
00:19:50,290 --> 00:20:02,610
-I haven ‘t notice anything. It has been good but lately I’ve noticed some stitching in both sides.

137
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,100
-Ovaries?
– I think so.

138
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:14,680
-Also you mentioned that you became irritable before menses. How is that now?

139
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:20,920
-I’m not being irritable before menses but it was a period when I was irritable.

140
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,430
-When was this period?

141
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:36,430
-It was in the period when I was not so social. Then I also reacted more aggressive.

142
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,790
-In May?
-No, it was in July.

143
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:47,140
-End of July?
–No, in the beginning before I went to Sweden.

144
00:20:52,400 --> 00:21:00,290
-What about fear of insects you have? It’s still there?

145
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:09,290
-Yes but not so. There was a wasp sitting on my feet and I let it sit there.

146
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:20,040
-It was sitting there, oh my god. How is your desire for salt?

147
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:28,380
Is it continuing or is the same as before? You put more salt now in your food?

148
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,140
-No I don’t put more salt in my food but I don’t recall it.

149
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:45,380
Usually when I’m out eating I think always it is too salty but it has not been noticed lately.

150
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:52,740
So I tolerate more salt, I’m also eating in the evening which I never did.

151
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:01,640
When I eat in the evening, I eat salt, a kind of meat which are salted.

152
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,380
And I eat more meat than what I did last time.

153
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,680
-Desire for meat is there?
-More. Because I used to eat more fish.

154
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:27,380
-She has not mentioned aversion fruit I see. The fruits, you don’t remember yourself eating fruits

155
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,230
or years before you used to eat fruits?

156
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:43,490
-Yes when I was training a lot I ate. I took with me fruits for the competition,

157
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:49,790
because it was easy and light to eat.

158
00:22:51,340 --> 00:23:01,600
-Do you remember when you stopped eating fruits? Where you were not taking fruits anymore?

159
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,350
What do you say? About.

160
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:18,500
-I really can’t remember but I have a feeling that there is a period

161
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:27,750
which I can’t remember very much and that’s the period when my parents divorced.

162
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:34,070
-What age you were?
-I was 15 years.

163
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:41,000
-And that period, between 15 and 20 you can not remember?

164
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:54,490
-It started some of the things from my childhood went away within that period.

165
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:02,330
I married very early, I was 17 years old and I got a child before that,

166
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:09,420
so it was a period with many problems.

167
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,410
-And with the first marriage you divorced or you stayed?

168
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,410
-No, I stayed.

169
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:20,910
-Until the time of all this happened with your marriage?

170
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:25,760
-Yes, I’ve been married for 28 years.

171
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,410
-You are still with the same man now?
-Yes.

172
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:35,410
–How is your relation with him?

173
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:50,930
-Our sexual relationship is not so good but we have a good relationship on other levels.

174
00:24:52,090 --> 00:25:03,250
I think he is the nicest person I even met but he is the kind of man who,

175
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:10,350
I think, he is doing everything right.

176
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:19,170
Therefore I also feel a little bit guilty because I do something bad sometimes.

177
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:37,320
-Do you have any desire with the meat to have fat?

178
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:45,320
-I had, my father was a butcher and he made many fat things when I was a child.

179
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:59,930
I really liked to eat the fat but lately no. I actually pick out the fat.

180
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,580
-How you tolerate the sun, especially here?

181
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,820
-Actually I thought if the sun is making something with my eyes

182
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:23,320
because I don’t have this in the winter time. And when I went down here, it started again,

183
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,820
so maybe it is because of the lighting.

184
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:39,180
But I was staying out in the ocean, by the sea every summer and it has not affected me that much.

185
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:48,580
I like the sun really but when it’s getting too hot I stay in the shadow.

186
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,940
And that I’ve done this summer because you had a very warm summer in Norway.

187
00:26:56,430 --> 00:27:04,200
I worked a lot, so I didn’t have vacation, so I didn’t want to go to the sun.

188
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,710
I was sitting in the shadow.

189
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,780
-How many children do you have?
-I have two children.

190
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,280
-What is your relationship with your children?

191
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,370
Is one daughter and one boy?
– Yes.

192
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,870
-With your daughter what is your relationship?

193
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:25,870
-I think it’s good now. There was a hard period when she was 6 years old

194
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:31,360
because I went to a school in another town and I lived there in the week

195
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:38,110
and I came home in the weekends and she changed a lot in that period so I had to work hard

196
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,460
to get a good relationship with her.

197
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,950
-How old is she now?
–She is 22.

198
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,880
-Is she married?
–No.

199
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:58,470
-You talk to her openly?
–Yes she always come to me.

200
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,360
-With your son?
-Yes, we are also talking a lot.

201
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:11,870
He doesn’t have to say opinion about the things that I do so we argue a little bit

202
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:23,710
but we talk a lot. But he is not so easy to talk about his feelings so I have to ask sometimes.

203
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:36,950
-How is the perspiration? Do you perspire?
-Not much. When I’m training I perspire a lot.

204
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,450
-Where is the first area?

205
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:49,460
-Face but when I ‘m a little bit stressed like now, I perspire under the arms.

206
00:28:49,560 --> 00:29:04,120
But I never use anything. I didn’t tell you so much about myself the first time I was here

207
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:11,620
because I didn’t feel like doing it but if it is concerning the case…

208
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,460
-Yes I would like to hear if you like to say.

209
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:26,200
-I didn’t have a good childhood. My mother was very harsh woman and I was beaten a lot.

210
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,050
-Beaten?
–Yes.

211
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:52,850
When I was 11 years old, she beat me so much that I couldn’t stand on my own feet.

212
00:29:52,950 --> 00:30:00,190
On that day I told her I will never go to cry again and she beat me

213
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:13,440
because she want me to feel sorrow but I haven’t done anything wrong. She just went on.

214
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,780
-She beat you with the hand?
-No, with a stick.

215
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:30,780
Then for two days I couldn’t go to school, it was bruises but that was the last time …

216
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,880
-She beat you?
– Yes.

217
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:41,780
Ever since I was a little child, maybe I was very …

218
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:48,460
-Naughty?
– Yes, so she couldn’t tell me but she beat me a lot.

219
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,870
-Your mother is still alive now?
–Yes.

220
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,780
-And she lives with your father?

221
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:08,500
-No, my father died in 1985 but he worked so much and he was not so much at home

222
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:23,590
and my mother was very nervous. I think she was very afraid not having a good…

223
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:30,920
what you call when you don’t manage things?

224
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:37,500
-Financially she may not be able to manage?

225
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:44,750
-No. She was nervous not to be perfect in a way.

226
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:51,350
-She was a perfectionist. She was nervous that not everything will be perfect.

227
00:31:52,610 --> 00:32:04,500
-I was training a lot and she wanted me to perform when we went to some parties

228
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:13,690
and I didn’t like it but that was the only time she ever showed that I had some value.

229
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:24,760
-And she regretted, she showed some regret later on?

230
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:36,100
-No, when I was 17 she told me that she had never loved me, she had loved the two other sisters.

231
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:49,090
But I thought I was over it…

232
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:57,430
-You thought you were over it but now it’s coming. It was kept inside all these years, sure.

233
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:14,920
Your father had shown a particular liking for you, you think?

234
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:29,920
-He was seldom at home.

235
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,000
-But when he was at home, he would show a preference for you

236
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,590
or he would show more affection to you, so your mother got jealous perhaps?

237
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:47,920
-Yes, he had a hard temper; so actually he was very harsh but I knew when I had him

238
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:56,350
because he wasn’t unfair. My mother was unfair in many ways.

239
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,850
I got beaten for things I didn’t do.

240
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:19,090
-You were accused for things and that’s why you run away with boys at what age, 14?

241
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:30,840
-My first companionship if I can say, was when I was 12 years and we kept together

242
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:47,170
until I was 14 but we didn’t have any sexual thing and I had two guys after that

243
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:49,600
and then my husband.

244
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:54,260
-When did you first had sexual contact? What age?

245
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,390
-I was 15, right after my parents were divorced.

246
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:05,580
-Immediately after they were divorced. Did you do it out of despair or…?

247
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,440
-I did it to hurt her because my mother was very moralistic.

248
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:28,330
That’s the way I’ve seen it afterwards. I knew I hurt her when I did it.

249
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:38,330
-And you told her or she knew. She didn’t know it until I got pregnant with my husband.

250
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,180
I didn’t tell her.

251
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,360
-You got pregnant immediately.
-Yes I was 16 years old.

252
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:56,790
-And then she supported you during this difficult time?

253
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:01,250
-Nobody supported me during that time. Everyone wanted me to take it away.

254
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:04,750
The doctor, the parents…

255
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,510
-Your father?

256
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:11,860
-My father said, you have to do what you have to do.

257
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:20,830
He wanted to support me if I wanted to keep it and he did.

258
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:29,940
-So you kept it and then you married the man?
-Yes, I married one year later.

259
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:48,090
-You like dancing?
-Yes.

260
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:55,690
-Very much. Did you take lessons in dancing, I believe.

261
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:04,630
-When I was training in gymnastics we had lectures on dancing because the floor exercise,

262
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:09,280
we had some ballet and some (?)

263
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:21,930
So when I stopped this training I went to jazz ballet school but I actually never dance so much

264
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:31,180
but when we are in a party. I haven’t’ dance since we were here last year, so it’s not so often.

265
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,560
-I see. Everybody remembers you danced very much here.

266
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,550
-Maybe that’s because you said it so they looked.

267
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:52,630
-All right. You like music?

268
00:37:52,730 --> 00:38:04,540
-Yes but that’s something in a way I have turned off. In the mornings I like to have quiet.

269
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:12,390
My husband turns on the radio, I like the music when it’s on but I never put it on myself.

270
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:18,490
-And you don’t like it loud?

271
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:26,040
-When my children play it loud in the car, I tell them to turn it down

272
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:34,140
but in a period I had the music loud.

273
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:48,290
-OK. Thank you. You want to say something else perhaps?

274
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,790
-No.

275
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:55,540
-Is something that you feel you did not say and you want to say?

276
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,220
-No.

277
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,510
-OK, next time.

278
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:40,280
There is a general problem I will tell you. And you will see it eventually.

279
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:50,280
If in a good prescription you drink coffee, there is a big problem and the problem is that.

280
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:59,540
After a good prescription, not every symptom comes back and therefore the problem is

281
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,030
when to repeat the remedy.

282
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:17,780
Is it time when she has good enough relapse and it will be easy if, OK I start to have a relapse,

283
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,280
you repeat the remedy and many times will not work.

284
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:29,470
And this is a big problem because a good case can be spoiled in this way.

285
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:44,200
We have to make judgment now whether in her case we have a relapse

286
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:55,300
or we have the development of a new situation, a new remedy or what do we have to do?

287
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:02,800
We repeat, we go higher, we give another remedy?

288
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:16,310
She has symptoms, she has sighing, we saw strong sighing again.

289
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:26,610
This is one of the symptoms, you remember, on which we prescribed Ignatia

290
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:31,360
and you can say still it’s there or maybe it’s there.

291
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:40,400
Maybe it was because of the anxiety of being in front of the class. So there is a symptom.

292
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:49,720
Another symptom which impressed me was that she still does not want fruits.

293
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:58,950
She used to take fruits or eat fruits a lot actually because she used to take with her.

294
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:08,560
Now she does not want to eat fruits yet. Again an Ignatia symptom.

295
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:39,610
-But she said that she drunk juices from fruits.
-She does not like fruit juices.

296
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:45,700
-Yes she does.
-No, she never drank before.

297
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:51,310
-She drinks juices OK.

298
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:09,200
-Is she going into a relapse yes or no? She starts having some symptoms,

299
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,720
she is starting a relapse, that is what she is saying.

300
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:22,360
When is going to end that relapse we don’t know and that is the problem at this moment.

301
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:28,450
She is starting a relapse, we don’t know she is continuing to have a relapse

302
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:38,130
or she is going to stay like this or even just become better? This is the question.

303
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:46,440
Is this a relapse? Are we going to repeat? We don’t have enough symptoms.

304
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:52,340
Maybe she is going back to relapse but it’s not clear. There is another remedy?

305
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,930
Maybe but it’s not clear.

306
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:05,670
At this stage what is your advice to the patient which you wrote it already

307
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,030
so you can not tell me lies.

308
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:22,000
-Stop to drink coffee.
-Stop drinking coffee exactly.

309
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:28,750
The advice to the patient at this moment, must be stop drinking coffee

310
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:38,500
and she may find without any other help that the organism comes back to normal.

311
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:44,000
If she stops drinking coffee, the organism may just go back to normal.

312
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:51,330
If the coffee has just already done a damage, she will continue and if she continues

313
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:57,830
and she is sighing in this way she does and she does not eat fruits,

314
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:03,080
never mind the pathology she has to repeat Ignatia.

315
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:09,840
But the advice here is stop drinking coffee and see what happens.

316
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:22,430
And most probably in about 2 weeks, she will recover again. She will feel good again.

317
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:33,910
-What I think it’s really great in this case is that she is doing much better

318
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:45,170
because now she has a possibility and she has the power to tell us her feelings

319
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:50,180
while before she couldn’t do it and I think this is coming up.

320
00:45:51,610 --> 00:46:01,990
I think we must really wait, don’t disturb this evolution of the case with the giving again Ignatia

321
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:13,850
or C12 and so on. It’s very well.
-Correct.

322
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:25,580
All this grief which has been kept inside all these years, all this grief has to come out

323
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:33,820
and it was a very good thing that she did that. Because that will release quite a lot.

324
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:41,330
It will take a load from the organism so the organism by stop drinking coffee

325
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:49,600
may just go back to full recovery with full enjoyment.

326
00:46:51,520 --> 00:47:01,340
With a possibility that she will go to Natrum Muriaticum but not at this moment.

327
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,500
-I have a completely different question. It concerns coffee. What in coffee is that disturbs?

328
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:16,010
Is it the caffeine and what about coca-cola and peppermint and chewing gum and so on?

329
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:27,260
-The problem is the caffeine. The problem also is the level of caffeine in the body.

330
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:36,510
Every one of us has the tolerance of certain level of caffeine in the blood.

331
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:45,680
Some of us will get excited with a little bit of caffeine. Some they need a bigger amount.

332
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:52,160
And some they drink caffeine and they go to sleep and it’s different

333
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:59,490
but most of the cases cause an excitement of the nervous system.

334
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:07,420
The circulation is stimulated and then the nervous system is also excited.

335
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:17,430
That is very bad for the organism, if you do it every day.

336
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:30,410
With tea which has caffeine, with coca-cola which has caffeine, we don’t raise the level of caffeine.

337
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:37,240
It seems that through the coffee, just because the coffee is burnt.

338
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,990
I don’t’ know what is in the coffee.

339
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:48,160
The caffeine is taken immediately in the organism and has an affect

340
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:51,660
and that affect we don’t like in Homeopathy.

341
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:59,760
If somebody tells you I drink coffee and I feel nothing, most probably in such a case

342
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:05,500
there is not going to be a relapse.

343
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,990
Most probably such an organism will tolerate the coffee without having …

344
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:15,240
The excitement of the coffee is the bad thing.

345
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:27,080
Anything which excites the system like the drugs, whatever they might be, Tavor, Valium

346
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:35,930
and all the psychotropic drugs that affect the nervous system, forget it.

347
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:47,080
-Two questions. The first, the caffeine is the antidote agent, would you advise patients

348
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:52,370
who seem to have a low tolerance to caffeine to stop drinking coca-cola

349
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:56,790
and also products that include caffeine such as chocolate?

350
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:06,060
-If there is somebody who is sensitive to coffee and he tells if I touch coffee I get very excited

351
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,180
of course out, no question.

352
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:22,060
But in my experience I have seen invariably caffeine will bring a relapse

353
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,410
almost in 98% of the cases.

354
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:33,930
A big or a small relapse but a relapse.

355
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,910
So therefore coffee is out.

356
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:47,560
At this moment we must not interfere, we should let the process develop by itself.

357
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:54,650
You are not going to help the organism to do more. She did quite a lot,

358
00:50:54,750 --> 00:51:02,980
even under the fact that she was in a state of a relapse. You saw the Ignatia state.

359
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:11,730
Already I was vacillating for a moment but when she gave out the information

360
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:24,330
that showed a release on the emotional level and so she can unload now, she can discuss.

361
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:33,720
That’s a process, you live it alone. She may have a consultation, if you are in a private practice.

362
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:41,220
You say OK I will see you again in 15 days, she will talk more, she will go more into details;

363
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:47,300
maybe she wanted today to speak a little more about these details

364
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:56,460
but as here is a teaching situation and not a very private consultation,

365
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:09,560
we can not go into details which are not useful.

366
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:16,300
What we understand? She is doing fine with the possibility of relapse.

367
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,490
You cut down the coffee and you let it develop.

368
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,140
-A question to the tea. You said tea is better?

369
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:30,970
-Tea is better because tea does not raise the caffeine level in the blood.

370
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:34,970
It’s not absorbed easily. I don’t know what happens.

371
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:40,210
-But some people say they can’t touch the tea. They get more excited than coffee.

372
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:44,770
-Some people yes. If they do say, immediately you stop it.

373
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:49,600
If they do say, with a cup of tea I have palpitations of course.

374
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,040
That means they are sensitive.

375
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:54,190
-Mint?

376
00:52:54,290 --> 00:53:04,020
-Mint you have to avoid especially in cases of Natrum Muriaticum.

377
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,200
Natrum Muriaticum cases absolutely, no mint.

378
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:12,190
-Decaffeinated coffee?

379
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:21,780
-Yes but it is a bad stuff by itself. It will spoil your stomach.

380
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:28,870
-Will it antidote the remedy?
-No, it will not antidote.

381
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:46,780
-I have read about strong smelling substances that they do harm to the prescription.

382
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:53,020
What about this?
-Yes.

383
00:53:53,120 --> 00:54:01,530
Hahnemann himself mentioned camphor, very strong smelling. Camphor seems to antidote

384
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:06,110
but I don’t have the experience because we don’t use camphor today.

385
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:10,690
We don’t use much camphor but everyone uses coffee.

386
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:19,270
If everyone was using camphor as a drink most probably we would know the real effect of camphor.

387
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:25,280
But now today we don’t use much camphor and of course it’s good to avoid.

388
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:38,210
And if you have a perfume with camphor, it’s better to change the perfume.

389
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:44,860
-I frequently had the experience that patients who are running on a homeopathic remedy

390
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:48,760
go to see their dentist and get some injections and that antidotes the remedy too.

391
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:57,880
-From dentists, there is no question about that.

392
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:10,950
There are certain organisms which are sensitive to certain substances.

393
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:16,960
Now these substances, if they are really sensitive, almost allergic,

394
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:26,810
even a mere contact with such substance can upset the organism.

395
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:35,810
Otherwise, especially coffee, you need to drink several coffees before you have a relapse.

396
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:47,880
Many times I say that theoretically, now you can see it very clearly

397
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:55,050
because both cases they did the sin of drinking coffee.

398
00:56:02,310 --> 00:56:10,500
-The last time, as we said, you were doing better, you started drinking coffee

399
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:15,000
and then there was a kind of relapse and then we discussed your case,

400
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:19,170
we saw Natrum Muriaticum also coming up, in the analysis.

401
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:24,920
But we didn’t give any remedy, we waited, you stopped the coffee

402
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:29,860
and now you are going to tell us what happened.

403
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:39,610
-At first I got aphea in my mouth and my menses come out after 14 days.

404
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:50,830
I was irritable two days before the menses, I got herpetic blister on my left lip.

405
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:54,330
-Which you had before?
-I had it before yes.

406
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:56,340
-How long if you remember?

407
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:07,580
-I think it was in 1992 and I had it once or twice afterwards

408
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:13,870
but the year 1992 I had it several times.

409
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:19,280
-And you treated that?
-No, never.

410
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:31,770
And it was itching pain in the vagina, it was electric like pain, itching.

411
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:40,420
Emotionally I felt very vulnerable and sensitive to the surroundings.

412
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:49,260
I was more secure in a way but all the things got inside me.

413
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:56,510
In October I went to see a medical doctor because the finger was not good,

414
00:57:56,610 --> 00:58:02,110
which I injured in Alonissos.

415
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:07,510
-I work with foot reflex therapy and I couldn’t use it, so I had to go to a doctor

416
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:18,450
to get half of my job. Because then I could use Homeopathy instead for the other half.

417
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:31,420
He wanted me to take a sample because he thought it was pus in the finger and he took a

418
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:39,140
needle and he wanted me to take the sample and I got convulsions and fainted for a long time.

419
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:44,730
-Fainted, because of pain?
-No actually I didn’t feel any pain.

420
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:46,970
-The moment that he prick you?

421
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:57,980
-No, no he was having this inside for a time taking out something and then I got convulsions.

422
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:07,060
He told me afterwards that it was very severe and he asked me if I had before

423
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,310
and I told him no and I fainted again.

424
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,720
-You fainted while you were talking to him?

425
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:18,980
-Yes, when I got up again he asked if I had these convulsions before.

426
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,480
I told him no and I fainted again.

427
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:26,560
-You fainted with convulsions or without convulsions?

428
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:30,910
-Not the second time. The first time I fainted with convulsions.

429
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:36,810
-How do you describe the convulsions? Can you show me?

430
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:48,360
-I can’t tell but he told I was cramping all over, shaking before I fainted

431
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:53,560
and I had to lay in his office for half an hour until I could stand on my feet

432
00:59:53,660 --> 01:00:03,980
and I was ice-cold all over and shaking and dizzy and this went on for two days afterwards.

433
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,160
So I couldn’t go to the job.

434
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:11,480
-Why do you think this happened? What was the feeling inside you?

435
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:17,410
The feeling that something was coming out of your body or that something was drawn out?

436
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:30,310
-I felt that I was going to vomit in a way. I only fainted once

437
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:39,060
and it was not like the way I fainted. I had to get some food inside which I couldn’t take.

438
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:51,660
I was (?) and I went to the toilet and I vomit and I had stool and passed out . And I was all the time fainting.

439
01:00:53,830 --> 01:01:02,360
After this I didn’t feel very good. So I faxed here in Alonissos but I couldn’t get an answer.

440
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:07,880
-You didn’t get an answer?
-So it went over and…

441
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:13,110
-When you write you always have to write several things

442
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:16,310
because it is very difficult for me to remember.

443
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:19,020
-Yes I think I wrote.

444
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:22,520
-I am the case of Ignatia from Norway where I took this…

445
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:25,360
-Yes I remember next time.

446
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:30,720
-Because me and my secretary we are struggling to see who is this patient.

447
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:39,270
-Why I wrote was because he wanted to give me cortisone and I didn’t take it

448
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:43,370
but in Norway we have to do what the doctor tells us.

449
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:51,940
Otherwise we don’t get any money from being away from job

450
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:59,080
but I decided not to do it and he was good, so he gave me the money.

451
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:03,740
-Did you tell him why you decide not to take cortisone?

452
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:12,380
-Yes. He saw that I was practicing nature medicine and in a way he accepted but he said

453
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,620
if you are going over 3 months, you have to do it.

454
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:18,880
-Over 3 months?

455
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:27,710
-Yes, if I was going half paid from the government, I would have to …

456
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:38,190
-Afterwards I had some problems with my sleep. It was difficult to go into sleep.

457
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:48,530
I was restless. I felt as if I have some hair when you wash your head,

458
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:58,710
you get some loose hair in the face and especially around my nose.

459
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:06,120
-Feeling of hair in the face. It was the first time you had that sensation?

460
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:14,430
-No, I had that sensation when I was stressed in a way.

461
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:19,290
But this was going on for nearly 14 days.

462
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:21,940
-And then it passed away.

463
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:33,110
-Yes it passed away and then at the same time I started to sweat a lot.

464
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:38,750
I also had that before but not for long time but this was for 14 days, totally wet

465
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:45,210
all over the body and I had to put my feet out of the cover,

466
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:49,310
even if it was in the winter time and I had the window open.

467
01:03:53,310 --> 01:04:05,950
Afterwards when this stopped I was generally more cold and also I was more vulnerable

468
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:17,550
and sensitive in general and all the time.

469
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:18,540
-That means …

470
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:26,790
-The emotions were more moving. I think it’s good but in a way it’s a new thing.

471
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:36,890
-It’s a pain. Nice to have emotions but all those emotions come with pain. I know.

472
01:04:38,890 --> 01:04:45,540
-I also moved to a new house. I worked a lot in the same period,

473
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:57,230
so it could have something to do with this stressing, the difficulty to sleep.

474
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:04,960
In January my daughter and grand daughter moved into our flat.

475
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:22,730
Then I started to get a bit irritable. She is not the girl who is doing a lot of things

476
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:28,210
and I worked a lot and I came home and she didn’t do anything…

477
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:32,140
-And you exploded.
-Yes and I had to tell her.

478
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:41,390
It’s a long time since I’ve done that but in younger age I always exploded.

479
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:48,880
-With the emotions now more strong you can not hold back.

480
01:05:48,980 --> 01:06:01,130
-No, I cant’. Then I got a period where I was kind of lazy.

481
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:18,880
I didn’t want to do my homework and I felt I did not so good, I felt I was a bad student.

482
01:06:18,980 --> 01:06:23,560
-Lazy woman?
-Really lazy.

483
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:29,030
I said myself that I was doing too many things at the same time

484
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:38,190
when I started to do something, I started with one thing and then another thing

485
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:43,940
and then another thing and I couldn’t concentrate on one thing at one time.

486
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:50,790
So I never got finished with anything because they were so many things going on at the same time.

487
01:06:53,120 --> 01:07:00,530
I actually saw that I’m working better under stress because then I had to sit

488
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:06,610
and do this one thing. So when I’m stressed I feel that I work better.

489
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:09,200
-Under stress you feel you work better?

490
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:14,690
-Yes when I have one week limit to do something, I can work, work, work

491
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:18,550
and I get exhausted afterwards.

492
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:23,950
-But if you get one month you are lazy 3 weeks and you work only the last week.

493
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:34,200
-Yes if I know I was having a lecture for some doctors and the government in Norway

494
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:41,450
are making some rules for nature medicine and I knew that I was going to have it

495
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:46,050
but I didn’t do anything until the week before.

496
01:07:56,050 --> 01:08:01,210
I have been very sensitive to tobacco smoke even though I smoke a lot myself

497
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:05,700
I can’t bear it inside, so I have to go out smoking.

498
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,300
-That’s great news.

499
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:20,220
-Even here in Alonissos I can’t smoke in the room; I have to go out in the terrace.

500
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,680
-Very interesting.

501
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:38,880
-In February-March I started with a flu and I got noise in my left ear, a clutching.

502
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:49,360
I actually got it here when I come to Alonissos too but not so strong.

503
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:53,710
-The first time did you get any medication the first time?

504
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:58,110
-I’m not taking any medications, never.

505
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:05,700
-Since you took the Ignatia? No medications. And the potency was 50M?

506
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:15,700
-Yes. I got pain the right ear, itching pain after this clutching went off I was very tired

507
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:26,310
I got a burning aphea in my mouth, I had a pain in the tooth flesh.

508
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:28,200
-In the gums?

509
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:34,710
-Yes and I got the herpes in the upper lip and that was the first time because

510
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:44,450
when I got it I had it on the upper lip. My tongue was burning

511
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:54,200
and I got small pimples on my face like when I got menses when I was younger.

512
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,950
-Acne?
-Yes.

513
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:59,040
-It’s about time.

514
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:14,420
-Yes and the flu started with a pain from the neck going up into the front of the head.

515
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:19,760
But I had since that time…

516
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,490
-And you still have?

517
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:28,320
-Yes when we are coming to the evening session here in Alonissos,

518
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:38,080
I start to have this kind of headache. Starting from the middle of the spine, thorax…

519
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:42,650
-Extending up to the head all around to the forehead?

520
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:46,180
-Yes, most of the pain is sitting here and in the front.

521
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:54,930
I also get it when I’m stressed, when I work much.

522
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:11,320
After this time I had very low energy, after this flu I was very tired

523
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:14,930
for nearly 14 days afterwards.

524
01:11:18,180 --> 01:11:30,080
It went away and 14 days afterwards I got a new flu but it started with pain from hip to hip.

525
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:36,510
I was very restless in my foot, I couldn’t sit still for a long time.

526
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:44,490
It was like the pain I had when I got the first session.

527
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:49,540
When I got it in the flight I couldn’t sit in the seat.

528
01:11:56,250 --> 01:12:08,830
When I was lying down in my bed the sickness and stitching got worse, from hip to hip.

529
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:12,930
-On hip joints stiffness worse.

530
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:26,330
-And I was very tired in my feet like heavy. That was what I had.

531
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:34,910
-What is the situation now? How would you describe it?

532
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:41,570
-Before I get here I was very bloated in my stomach, the stool was loose

533
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:51,930
and I had to go to the toilet twice in the morning and it was like flash, two times.

534
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:58,570
I have more wanting for cold water, I drink a lot.

535
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:06,400
-Now do you have this now? This diarrhea in the morning, not exactly diarrhea.

536
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:11,920
-It is not formed.

537
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:16,790
-But comes as an explosion.
-Yes.

538
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,910
-What time is that you wake up?

539
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:34,410
-That part has changed a lot because I woke up at 5 o’clock but now I wake 6.30

540
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:39,670
and I can lay in the bed without standing up, I couldn’t do that before.

541
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:40,920
-You couldn’t do that?
-No.

542
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:53,010
If I woke up at 4 , 4.30 I stood up from the bed at once but now I can lay and sleep.

543
01:13:53,770 --> 01:13:55,160
I never thought I can do that

544
01:13:55,260 --> 01:14:01,490
because my husband can lay until 11 o’clock in the Sunday morning, I can’t.

545
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:05,680
-Now you can?
-Now I can but not so long.

546
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:20,270
I started to urinate a large amount and very often and I feel that I can’t empty my bladder.

547
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:28,880
Sometimes I finished and I’m going away and there is coming more.

548
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:47,630
And I also feel a warm feeling in urethra. It’s a warm feeling.

549
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:58,510
I have constant sore throat not a pain but I always feel when I’m swelling.

550
01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:10,020
I have gained much weight which I dislike, I gained a lot of weight.

551
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:16,380
-How much?
-5-6 kilos.

552
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:32,280
I also have this stiffness in my lower back and actually I think it’s a little bit changing

553
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:36,770
from this pain in the head to the back.

554
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:44,760
-Stiffness in the lower back. It’s gone away from here and it’s more now in the lower back.

555
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:50,520
-Yes but it is changing because sometimes I’ve got this in the lower back and sometimes

556
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:56,200
when this comes on, I don’t have this in the lower back.

557
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:12,190
Something I noticed is that when I’m giving a lecture, my voice get very hoarse afterwards

558
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:15,520
and I’ve given lectures for many years but I’ve never had it.

559
01:16:15,620 --> 01:16:20,130
-You never had that?
-Not so much.

560
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:37,600
Menses the last two times have been very little and this time it took a long time

561
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:41,850
before the red blood came out.

562
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:52,040
I’ve been going 4-5 days before the flow began and that’s not normal.

563
01:16:53,040 --> 01:17:00,430
-But the flow when it came it was in duration the same as before?

564
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:08,140
-Yes I think so. But usually I have painless start of the menses

565
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:27,250
and I can only feel the stitch in my ovary when I have the (?) and especially in the right ovary.

566
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:33,870
Everything else I think I feel in my left side, so this is a new thing.

567
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:47,530
And I feel a kind of restless thing. I can go from one place and I can stop and …

568
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:52,190
what I was going to do and I have to go back again.

569
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:01,650
I think that’s it.

570
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,250
-That’s it?

571
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,810
-I’ve got a lot of pimples in my back which I haven’t had before.

572
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:16,980
-You haven’t them before and you don’t like it. Your back is itchy?

573
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:24,990
-That I had for a long time ago and it was really not good, scratch and scratch

574
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:32,580
until it is really a sore but it has not been like that, this one not so much scratching.

575
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:38,560
-You had that before you said?
-Yes in the lower back.

576
01:18:41,330 --> 01:18:43,490
-You never mentioned here that symptom.
-No.

577
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:53,070
–Because it wasn’t there?
-No it wasn’t there, it was a long time ago.

578
01:18:53,170 --> 01:18:58,000
-How long? You would say 5, 10 years?
-Yes something like that.

579
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:03,900
-Now there are more pimples but not so much itching.

580
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,750
-Not so much.

581
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:15,980
-In the region now you have this, is the thoracic region or the cervical and thoracic?

582
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,650
-No, the thoracic.

583
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:24,400
-And you never had pimples there before, as far as you can remember?

584
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:31,080
-Yes perhaps I have it once or twice but not often.

585
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:52,070
-One more thing. When I swallow it stitch up to the left ear

586
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:57,060
but it’s not always it is from time to time.

587
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:01,820
-Can you give me an overview of the difference?

588
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,910
How you feel now in comparison with before the treatment?

589
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:12,830
-More secure but also more vulnerable.

590
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:28,500
-But as far as inner feelings, I’d like to hear your evaluation.

591
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:34,820
-I feel better in general, much better.

592
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:43,150
-Good but what I want to know is how much better, that means in what respect?

593
01:20:51,870 --> 01:21:00,340
I can see your face but it’s not enough. I would like you to express the differences.

594
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:07,580
-When I talk to people, I talk more easily.

595
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:15,230
-You are more free to express your emotions, your feelings.

596
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:30,240
-Yes, earlier I was afraid to express things, I was more alerting but now I can relax.

597
01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:31,480
-Guarding yourself. Now you can relax.

598
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:36,090
-If they say something I think, that’s not my problem.

599
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:42,710
-OK very good.

600
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:16,000
-If you go now to her case and we see in the analysis, in the first part of the analysis

601
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:27,420
you will say what? When you hear that she got the herpes in her genitalia?

602
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:35,960
Immediately your mind went to which remedy?

603
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,010
-Natrum Muriaticum.
-Natrum Muriaticum.

604
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:53,160
As she gave more and more information, what was the remedy that was manifesting?

605
01:22:53,260 --> 01:23:01,660
After this herpes, she went into a period where she could not sleep, in a period

606
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:16,000
where she was very perspiring and feet out of covers, which was the remedy

607
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,250
that came to your mind?

608
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:20,600
Sulphur.

609
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:30,500
-You see we are scientists because most of us we agree

610
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:35,350
that this is the development of the case.

611
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:46,990
Then you hear the whole story and then you have to decide what to do.

612
01:23:47,090 --> 01:24:00,090
The remedy has been given one year ago I think. Exactly, last May.

613
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:13,500
It was interfered by coffee, we took away the coffee without repeating,

614
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:19,750
we let the organism and the organism continued. Why it was that?

615
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:25,740
Because her remedy it was deep enough. It was very deep.

616
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:32,740
If this was happening and the remedy was not deep, the coffee would antidote it

617
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:40,250
and she would need a repetition. In case she was in lower or middle group 3.

618
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:53,500
She was a depression on group 3 uppermost layer. That was the diagnosis.

619
01:24:53,600 --> 01:25:03,500
But if she was on group 4 upper layers or group 3 lower and you give a remedy

620
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,090
and she drinks coffee, the remedy will be antidoted immediately.

621
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:15,090
Then you have to repeat, why? Can anybody tell me?

622
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:24,740
Why the remedies on the lower part can be easily antidoted?

623
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,680
Much more easy antidoted?

624
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:32,450
-I think because the vital force is not strong enough to sustain it

625
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:36,660
and we could (?) from antidoting the coffee if it was on the higher levels,

626
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:40,410
it’s more strong and can rebound faster.

627
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:44,000
-It’s obvious, that is the reason.

628
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:54,470
I have told you sometimes when you have some patient going to the dentist

629
01:25:54,570 --> 01:26:01,540
and after the dentist, you see a relapse starting, don’t jump into the picture

630
01:26:01,640 --> 01:26:03,210
and give the remedy.

631
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:10,960
Wait, it might happen that after the dentist the patient will remain will come back by itself,

632
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:13,710
without repetition.

633
01:26:13,810 --> 01:26:20,050
Now you know a little bit more that it depends where the patient is.

634
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:32,400
That this will be better or will stay relapsed depending on the pathology.

635
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:41,210
And it is a great pity, if you have lower cases with deep pathology, you give a remedy

636
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:49,550
and you touch the case and it starts a process. Then you interfere with antidotal…

637
01:26:49,650 --> 01:27:07,400
that is very unfortunate because the antidotal effect may not come clear to the same remedy.

638
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:15,400
Then you repeat and it doesn’t act and then you have problems.

639
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:30,300
So what shall we do in this case? Shall we give Natrum Muriaticum, shall we give Sulphur

640
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:34,900
or will give nothing for the time being?

641
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:52,730
-Who says we give Natrum Muriaticum? Who says Sulphur? Who says nothing?

642
01:27:53,230 --> 01:28:03,680
-OK you are learning. This is the idea. You just let the remedy continue,

643
01:28:03,780 --> 01:28:10,630
you see the action and she will be most probably going into which remedy?

644
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:21,730
Next remedy what will be? There is any indication? Who wants to speak?

645
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:37,140
-I believe she turns finally to Sulphur because she begins to (?)

646
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:40,630
and the perspiration non stopped and cold water.

647
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:49,120
-She will be going into Sulphur. Most probably the other Ignatia will be going to Sulphur

648
01:28:49,220 --> 01:29:07,260
and I have mentioned that many times Ignatia goes, as second remedy, to Sulphur. Many times.

649
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:18,630
Usually the complimentary remedy for Ignatia is … Natrum Muriaticum.

650
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:24,640
But I can tell you that I have seen more cases after Ignatia, going to Sulphur

651
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:27,330
than going to Natrum Muriaticum.

652
01:29:31,310 --> 01:29:37,100
Ignatia and Natrum Muriaticum are complementary in the grief.

653
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:46,220
Some grief stays inside there and you have to deal with that grief,

654
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:50,220
then most probably the Natrum Muriaticum.

655
01:29:50,320 --> 01:30:01,480
But when you have to deal after Ignatia with laziness or different things, then it goes to Sulphur.

656
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:07,380
-But she said that emotionally she feels more vulnerable

657
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,960
and for me that is clear in Natrum Muriaticum.

658
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:23,600
-No. This is not Natrum Muriaticum, I will explain to you.

659
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:38,010
When somebody says, I’m vulnerable it doesn’t mean that he is vulnerable.

660
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:42,720
Everyone is vulnerable, there is no way that you can ask anybody from us here

661
01:30:42,820 --> 01:30:51,470
and he will say, I’m not vulnerable, I’m strong. Anyone will say I’m vulnerable.

662
01:30:51,570 --> 01:31:00,130
Natrum Muriaticum is vulnerable but he will not say it because he is closed

663
01:31:00,230 --> 01:31:11,890
and hits on the outside. Somebody tells something, he closes more. That is not the case.

664
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:14,390
I could not see it.

665
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:25,990
She was expressing, the emotions becoming more alive is a great sign of returning to youth.

666
01:31:27,750 --> 01:31:30,400
Returning back to young age.

667
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,610
-What?

668
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:45,800
-If the emotions become alive, you hear a patient saying, my emotions are more alive.

669
01:31:45,900 --> 01:32:00,010
You see through diseases and experiences the emotions become less and less

670
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:05,500
until we have no emotions anymore and we act like robots.

671
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,010
Mentally, this is right, this is wrong, we do this, we do that

672
01:32:09,110 --> 01:32:12,550
and of course we go to all kinds of deviations.

673
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:17,510
Now you give the homeopathic remedy and you see the emotions become alive.

674
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:24,610
Strong emotions. Then you have hit the real source of life.

675
01:32:25,410 --> 01:32:38,610
And the emotions actually being more alive indicate … who has live emotions?

676
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:49,860
Only the children have emotions which are alive. We are very closed

677
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:56,700
but the child will jump with the emotions, the emotions are alive, strong.

678
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:07,130
Now if the patient says, my emotions have become alive is going back to young age.

679
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:15,770
We agree we must wait, the possibility for going to the next remedy is Sulphur.

680
01:33:15,870 --> 01:33:18,190
We’ll have it in mind and we’ll see.

681
01:33:18,290 --> 01:33:26,830
-If this patient, in the time of the flu was here or after the time of the flu,

682
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:34,460
when she had the low level of energy, then you would have repeated Ignatia?

683
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,470
-Yes sure, I would have made a mistake most probably.

684
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:44,890
I don’t know, I’m not sure but most probably I would have made a mistake in prescribing.

685
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:51,790
Because the moment somebody comes and presses you for a remedy, you say yes.

686
01:33:51,890 --> 01:34:00,720
But it is interesting that the acutes which are quite strong are not treated

687
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:08,460
and yet she is going over it. I don’t know, as I said yesterday,

688
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:21,560
if we had given the correct remedy for the acute, maybe even the result would be much quicker.

689
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:30,210
The problem is to find the correct remedy during the acute.

690
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:37,560
You find the acute remedy correct then the process of healing is speeded up.

691
01:34:39,140 --> 01:34:44,970
But you are tempted to do that every time and because you don’t have enough symptoms,

692
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:50,150
you make a mistake. And this is the problem.
