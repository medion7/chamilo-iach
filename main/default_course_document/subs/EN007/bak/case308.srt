1
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,490
-Αt the moment my biggest problem is that I forgot my notes at home. I put everything

2
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:29,990
down and left it at home. In the last days, I try to remember I put new notes but I don’t

3
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,900
know if they are complete.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,910
First I want to tell you some mind symptoms and then some physical complains and

5
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:43,980
I think only later on I am going to unpack my real, big problems.

6
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,470
I’m afraid I’m going to cry a lot, that’s why I want to say the other things before so

7
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:55,230
that they will not flow away with my tears.

8
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,480
For already quite some time I have problems in remembering.

9
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:05,400
My memory is getting worse. I have a hard time in remembering names and that’s

10
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:12,100
getting worse and worse.

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,840
-Yes in what else she does not remember?

12
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:22,090
-Sometimes I start to mix up words and letters, when I talk and when I write.

13
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,840
Or I only realize that when I’ve already written it, I say I mixed these two letters.

14
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:34,340
I should have done it the other way around or when I say something, in the moment that

15
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,850
I’ve spoken it out I realize that I mixed it up.

16
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,540
In my head words are OK, they are right but what comes out is quite a different word.

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,770
-I see.

18
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:57,000
-That troubles me, worries me because maybe there is something wrong in my head.

19
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:04,250
Forgettable and besides this I have different kinds of pains.

20
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:16,510
-These are the big problems she mentioned or there is a big problem coming later?

21
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:25,010
-I sometimes have vertigo when I ‘m tensed or when I’ tired but sometimes just like this.

22
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,010
-When she has vertigo, things are turning?

23
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:51,850
-Dizziness and for a short moment I’m going from side to side. I have to concentrate very much to be

24
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:58,850
Especially if there are a lot of different noises in the room, as if my hearing is scattered

25
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,510
and I don’t really get any message anymore.

26
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,260
My ability to see is diminishing too.

27
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,930
-How old is she?

28
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:26,180
-54 this year. At night and at dawn I only can see badly, I have hard time to see.

29
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:36,380
Grey colors I can only see very little. I’m afraid to forget something important.

30
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,850
I make a lot of notes and sometimes I forget my notes.

31
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:58,100
I have pains in the right wrist, when I write and whatever I do from this hand.

32
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:05,790
It gets better when I apply something warm but sometimes I have to grip it tightly.

33
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:11,540
Sometimes I have pains here in the middle of the hand and at the root of the hand

34
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:20,930
so it can hardly grasp anything. Sometimes I have pains in my lower arm.

35
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:30,380
It feels like I hit it or like somebody hit it or like it’s broken, the pain is to my right shoulder

36
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,540
but not permanently, not constantly and pain in the left shoulder too.

37
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,290
Sometimes here, sometimes there.

38
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:47,040
The pain on the left shoulder on scapula feels as if it was broken.

39
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:56,540
Pain like broken or bony pain are sometimes to my right hip, hip joint.

40
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:03,370
It is as if something working in my bone and aching.

41
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,430
-How many remedies she has taken?

42
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,400
-For some time I’ve been in homeopathic treatment of a doctor and I got quite

43
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,900
some remedies, quite a number of remedies.

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,380
-We have to know all the remedies.

45
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,070
-I don’t know all of them because she didn’t tell me although I asked her to tell me.

46
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:30,990
I can remember some of them. The first was Ignatia 10M.

47
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,490
After this I was crazy for half a year.

48
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,230
-So that means she was worse?

49
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:48,740
-I was terribly anxious especially when I was moving, when driving a car.

50
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,780
-Under Ignatia?

51
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,770
-Yes.

52
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,740
-And now she is not anxious anymore?

53
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,740
-Much less but I have different fears. When I took Ignatia my worse fear was

54
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,240
when I was driving a car and another car was ahead of me. I was always afraid

55
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,490
that the next moment I would hit him.

56
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,230
-How does she know that this is from Ignatia? I don’t understand.

57
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,670
-I didn’t have that before.

58
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:24,070
-Yes but we develop symptoms. Does she have any reason that this is from Ignatia?

59
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,570
She took Ignatia one day and next day she developed that symptom?

60
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,520
This has nothing to do with Ignatia.

61
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:44,070
-No, I took Ignatia and then gradually this symptom developed.

62
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:50,480
-And she never had that before?

63
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,240
-No, I didn’t have that before but later on, many years later I got to know that when

64
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,740
I was a little child, somebody hit me against the wall.

65
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:10,370
He pushed me against the wall and I see some connection to this.

66
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,730
-So from Ignatia she did not have a positive action. She had a negative action.

67
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,530
-I see it this way.

68
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:23,030
-What else she remembers?

69
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:29,780
-After Causticum I realized that I lost my big fear of dogs. That wasn’t suddenly.

70
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:38,780
Just I realized that I can pass a dog without being afraid of it.

71
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,530
After Causticum too I realized that my vertigo in high places got very much better

72
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:53,030
almost even gone. And before all my life I remember that if I was just 1m above

73
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,790
the ground I was very dizzy.

74
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,030
-With Causticum this was gone totally?

75
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,780
-I realized when I was painting the windows of my house, in the first floor, I had to go

76
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:16,230
outside of the window on a small window pave and that was OK.

77
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,150
-From Causticum she did not feel in general, better?

78
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:27,870
-I felt the courage to struggle, to fight for myself.

79
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,610
-She never took it again?

80
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,360
-No.

81
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,870
-What potency it was?

82
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:38,120
-C200 I think. 30 or 200.

83
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,610
-And Ignatia what it was?

84
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,030
-87.

85
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,050
-That was the first remedy Ignatia?

86
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:51,140
-Yes.

87
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,390
-Can she mention first all the remedies, then I ask?

88
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:03,660
-Pulsatilla, Natrum muriaticum, Kreosotum from this homeopath and I don’t know

89
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,610
what else she gave me.

90
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:16,570
-How many other times she took? 20, 50? Any other effect from the remedies?

91
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:22,570
-From Pulsatilla I had to cry a lot and my knees were aching.

92
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,250
-What year was Pulsatilla?

93
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,000
-Before Causticum.

94
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:34,250
-1989? Natrum muriaticum she had an effect?

95
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:45,700
-I was crying a lot but I have a lot of reasons to cry.

96
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,700
-Then Kreosotum had an effect?

97
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,370
-I got Kreosotum because I had colpitis, discharge from the vagina.

98
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:03,180
-She had vaginitis, she took Kreosotum, what happened?

99
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,120
 that I couldn’t walk.

100
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:10,860
In the beginning of 1990.

101
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,360
-After Causticum?

102
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,610
-Yes.

103
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,280
-Can she remember if this was because of Causticum?

104
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,190
-I can’t really tell exactly because I have my notes at home and the homeopath

105
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,190
didn’t answer me to my request to tell me what I took.

106
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:32,190
-First of all we want to know all the remedies, second we want to know what was

107
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:38,440
the effect of each remedy. Otherwise her case is a mess, we cannot proceed.

108
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,940
Actually we have to stop. What is her real problem?

109
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,190
-It’s my childhood, I’ve dealing with a lot of problems and I’ve been working with

110
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:54,100
these problems. I am at the point where I get stuck. I don’t really know how to proceed.

111
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,100
-What are these problems?

112
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,600
-I have to cry a lot and I have the impression that this problem is eating up my energy.

113
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,860
-Who told you that? She has been to psychoanalysis?

114
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,370
-No.

115
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,190
-Never?

116
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:18,190
-I did psychotherapy for 2 years but I went in search this psychotherapy because

117
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:29,690
I was fighting with this problem by myself for so long.

118
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:37,940
-She went into psychotherapy for 2 years, the problems were there before and

119
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,690
remain after the psychotherapy?

120
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,890
-These problems accompany me throughout my life and after the psychotherapy

121
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,550
I could understand a little bit better but the problem remained.

122
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,280
-There is no change. Can she describe the problems or she does not want to

123
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,610
talk about?

124
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:58,850
-Yes I want to, that’s why I’m here. Since I’ve been in this life I had real

125
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:07,270
difficulties. I had a difficult start, my family didn’t have the room and the love to

126
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:14,770
accept me. I was born during the war time and my mother was very disappointed

127
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:22,690
that I wasn’t the desired son. I am the second child, I have an older sister.

128
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:26,190
We were away from the place where we normally lived.

129
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:32,690
-I don’t want such details. Essential things if she can tell me.

130
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:38,190
What made her being so sad. It can not be that she was born in the war that made

131
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,440
her sad.

132
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,190
-My grandmother was responsible for looking after the children and she was a very

133
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:57,280
rough person and she would hit me. I had the impression she hated me.

134
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,020
-What else?

135
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,190
-I was constantly afraid as a child, I never felt secure at home.

136
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:13,720
-Because of the grand mother? Her own mother she did not protect her?

137
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:21,690
-No. My mother was working, my father was not at home anymore and my grand

138
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,180
mother was as such.

139
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:30,440
-So the problem is because her grandmother was hitting her without reason.

140
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,190
-It’s connected to this.

141
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,140
-I don’t understand.

142
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,600
-The problem is that my mother is living near to me since 10 years and I have a

143
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:47,360
hard time dealing with this and our meetings and our confrontations, I don’t really

144
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,860
know how to deal with this.

145
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:59,800
She probably wants something from me and I just withdraw from this.

146
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,020
I want to be friendly with her, I want to have contact with her but just on the surface.

147
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,770
Mother is 84.

148
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,520
-What is the big problem?

149
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:14,020
-That I can’t make myself free from the demands of my mother.

150
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:20,030
She wants that I’m there for her, that I look after her but this is impossible for me.

151
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:26,770
-Let’s go to another issue. How she feels? She feels anxious, she has fear of death?

152
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:34,770
She feels sad, depressed, irritable? What are the feelings inside?

153
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:41,890
-My mother demands my caring for her and she never looked after me.

154
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:47,100
She never cared for me and now I can’t give it to her but she demands that

155
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,310
permanently.

156
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:53,270
-Therefore she has a guilty feeling because she can not.

157
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:59,530
-I don’t want that, I can’t do this. For me it’s a big feeling of injustice that she wants

158
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,270
things from me that she didn’t give to me when it was appropriate time.

159
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,020
-She wants to punish her mother now?

160
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,520
-No. I just want to be left alone by her.

161
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,460
-That means when her mother says, I have this, I have that, why don’t you come to

162
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:26,970
look after me, she feels the pain for that and then she wants to withdraw from that pain

163
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,960
or she doesn’t feel anything?

164
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:36,630
-I don’t want that she constantly grabs at me, I want that if she feels good and she is OK

165
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:42,380
but I want that other people look after her, so that she is fine and I want that she lives me

166
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,380
alone.

167
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,630
-But why?

168
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,630
-When my mother is in front of me and starts moaning and lamenting and complaining

169
00:15:50,730 --> 00:16:00,050
I only can withhold that for certain time. Then I get very little again and I’m in the old

170
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:11,550
situation. I’m in despair. I want to leave that early part of my life behind me.

171
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:18,790
I want to live my present. I want to face my duties and the tasks that come up to me and

172
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,800
I want to live the now.

173
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,800
-Is she married?

174
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,420
-I’m divorced.

175
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,930
-She has children?

176
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,620
-Yes.

177
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,340
-How is she doing with her children?

178
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:36,420
-I have one daughter, we care for one another and we can live for one another in peace.

179
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:43,420
It’s a balanced and good relationship but with my mother I have the impression she

180
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:54,430
demands from me and she is clingy and I feel that it’s a big injustice.

181
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,120
When she complains so much about me then I fall back into my childhood, I get so much

182
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,590
depression.

183
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:11,590
-She falls back to her childhood means she remembers what was the situation by that

184
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:17,590
time or she feels like a little girl unprotected and things like that?

185
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:25,510
-I feel exposed to the violence that my family did to me.

186
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,760
-I didn’t follow exactly.

187
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:42,120
-I feel exposed to the violence that my family did to me.

188
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,090
-That means she is living the memory of violence?

189
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:54,590
-Yes, these are horrible memories and then I can’t stop crying but it doesn’t help, it

190
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,830
doesn’t make it any better.

191
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:13,260
-But she feels that they have done a great injustice to her.

192
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,420
In which weather she feels good.

193
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,420
-Not to hot but I like the sun. I can’t tolerate sun on my head.

194
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,920
-What about cold, wet weather?

195
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:37,090
-I’m freezing when it’s cold but when I’m dressed up warm, I can tolerate.

196
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:44,340
-I didn’t ask cold, I asked cold and wet. With her arthritis she is suffering or no?

197
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,340
-When I get cold in my body, then I’m suffering.

198
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,590
-In which weather she feels best with her arthritis?

199
00:18:52,690 --> 00:19:01,090
-A little bit of sun and a little bit of wind. Not too hot and not too cold.

200
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:12,010
I can’t tolerate humid in my body. Any drop of water I have immediately to put away

201
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,260
even in hot summer.

202
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,510
Too in the house my task is to go and see families and sometimes in these families I have

203
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:27,840
to prepare bath for a little child and for infant and then I have to prove the temperature of

204
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,930
the water with my hand and when I take out the hand, I immediately have to dry it.

205
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:39,430
But I like to go for swim in cold water. But when I get out of it, I immediately have to dry

206
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:44,620
myself.

207
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,300
-Does she take sweets?

208
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:55,680
-Little. But I like salt. I put it on the palm of the hand and I eat where other people would

209
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,090
eat sugar.

210
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:07,340
-So much. Does she eat eggs? – Little.

211
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,350
-Was any other trauma in her life except of her grand mother hitting her?

212
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,010
-The injustice of the punishments.

213
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,020
-That is the main thing.

214
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:28,680
-That really can’t forget.

215
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:53,070
-OK.

216
00:20:53,170 --> 00:21:01,260
The problem with this case is, for instance, the correct remedy was given somewhere in

217
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,960
the story and then it was spoiled.

218
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:16,250
Then the action of the remedy was destroyed.

219
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:28,610
This can be a very mixed case. The reason is that the correct remedy was given in the past

220
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:39,290
and then followed up with all other incorrect remedies and as a result, we have nothing.

221
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,040
Do you understand?

222
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,700
Which is the correct remedy?

223
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,710
-Causticum.

224
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:53,950
-Causticum was given, she did not realize the homeopath that after this reaction, when she had

225
00:21:54,050 --> 00:22:07,280
 this terrific discharge, that is a very good sign. You don’t go and cover it.

226
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:13,230
And then of course you give the second wrong remedy and the third, the fourth and the

227
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:20,700
fifth and then you have a mess.

228
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:27,200
I didn’t want to take the case because taking such a case it will take 5 hours before you

229
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,200
can understand what is going on. 5 hours you need at least.

230
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:37,370
Then, if you are not experienced, you are totally lost because all the symptoms of the

231
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,040
Materia Medica will be there.

232
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:50,700
Therefore I had to make … Margaret pushed me to take the case. I said, forget it.

233
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,900
If we don’t know the remedies, we don’t know the reactions, how do we know what is

234
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,370
going on?

235
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:03,530
Then when I hear she was given Ignatia and she had this, what?

236
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:11,540
Then she was given Causticum and two symptoms left. It was fear of dogs and the other

237
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:19,780
one was vertigo high places. These are two symptoms, one is a fear and the other is a

238
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:28,290
general symptom which can not be affected without the whole organism being affected.

239
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:35,530
That means the Causticum had a positive effect.

240
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:41,530
She, herself did not understand, the homeopath did not understand, soon after that other

241
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,290
remedies followed and were given.

242
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:50,550
Eventually the effect of the Causticum was that she brought out the discharge, beautiful.

243
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,710
You leave the discharge there. If it’s a case like that, you try to cure the discharge?

244
00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:06,710
Forget it. For how long? For 1 year, 2 years, let her have the discharge.

245
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:16,990
Burning? Yes. Burning inside is much worse.

246
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:25,920
The problem which makes me irritable and makes me impatient, I have been trying to

247
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:34,920
teach and teach and finally I see simple, basic things are not followed.

248
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:48,410
You give the correct remedy and still you can not recognize it. This is very unfortunate.

249
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:56,610
Then I get very irritable because I know how difficult it is to bring back such a case.

250
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:05,580
The two symptoms of Causticum are missing now. Fear of dogs and vertigo high places

251
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:14,750
are missing; what do we have? The injustice.

252
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,500
Therefore what has happened?

253
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,150
-I don’t understand. In these difficult cases which people mess up themselves, your

254
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,890
patience seems endless and in this difficult case where somebody comes for the first

255
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:37,050
time, you have none. That really hurts me.

256
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:42,510
-I must apologize. I must give you an explanation.

257
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:51,760
My impatience came not from her. It came from wrong way of treating with Homeopathy

258
00:25:51,860 --> 00:26:01,020
and my despair was equally big with hers when I saw I can not help her.

259
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:10,270
Then I got irritated, why? Because I saw why this case is in that condition.

260
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:20,940
Because of wrong Homeopathy.

261
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:30,180
I didn’t want to take up the case because it was messed up and then I was irritated that

262
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:37,180
I could not help, sorry.

263
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:46,680
Of course it appeared as if I had something against her. No I wanted to help and I was in

264
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:52,180
despair; that is the reaction.

265
00:26:52,280 --> 00:27:00,630
Then unless I got so angry and shouting, I would never have found anything.

266
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:09,600
I would just say bye, bye. Because I got angry, maybe I will help her.

267
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:19,850
So for me it’s not a matter of handling. It’s a matter of being able to help.

268
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:23,600
And being able to help is not always to be nice.

269
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:28,010
Sometimes you have to be very aggressive.

270
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:33,270
Unless you’re aggressive, you don’t get the facts. For 5 hours we can be working there

271
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:38,180
we get nothing.

272
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:49,680
Either I had to say, out or I had to act in this way, for her own benefit.

273
00:27:49,780 --> 00:28:03,930
But you are free to act in these cases, as you please.

274
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:13,130
I don’t ask you to follow my method of treatment and my method of treatment is

275
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:20,260
individualized as much is the remedy individualized.

276
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,520
Each one has a method and this is the method.

277
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:32,270
You have not seen me before in this just because you have not seen me in all my cases.

278
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:36,760
There are several cases in which I have done exactly the same.

279
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:42,180
Unless I was very aggressive, I would not get anything.

280
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:47,350
I  would just go on, go on, I would be depleted totally in the end. I would not be able to

281
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:55,640
help the patient. When I became angry, and I said give me the facts, the facts came out.

282
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:01,130
I believe in this case also that maybe because of that treatment, maybe she will be

283
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,400
helped.

284
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:09,820
Now what do you prefer? Nice, nice man, then finished.

285
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:17,520
Everybody will be exhausted, everybody will know not to give the remedy, what to do?

286
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:24,680
In the beginning everybody is in despair. What’s the use of that?

287
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:33,680
Of course I’m in a state of Nux vomica because of too much.

288
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,180
-What potency?

289
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:47,430
-High potency.

290
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:56,180
-Concerning the remark that she was made, concerning the injustice to others.

291
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:02,350
First of all the moment she sat there and she looked.

292
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:11,070
We have to go back to Causticum I wanted to make you aware.

293
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:20,960
Maybe I will ask you to find where I describe in Causticum the intensity with which

294
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:31,880
they look. There is an intensity of look which is typical in Causticum and that is the case.

295
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:48,600
Did you see this intensity? Everything is there, in front.

296
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:55,050
And that is typical. When you look at her, you say this is a case of Causticum and then

297
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:06,430
she tells me that Causticum took two symptoms out, only two symptoms out?

298
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:10,180
Then eventually it comes out that the discharge was there.

299
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,380
When it was the discharge? We don’t’ know, we don’t remember etc.

300
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:26,460
But most probably this is what happened and then the idea of injustice where it is unjust

301
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:33,180
they can’t tolerate, this is whether it is on yourself or on others, this is Causticum.

302
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:41,430
The idea is they have done some injustice to me or to others, it doesn’t matter.

303
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:49,430
As we described, it it’s very seldom that you will see the injustice of Causticum in others.

304
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:54,850
Concerning the sympathy, how do you expect it. Here, I would project.

305
00:31:54,950 --> 00:32:01,600
I will say that most probably the way she treats her mother is because she is too

306
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:06,090
sympathetic with the mother. She feels too much the pain and says, I can’t take it

307
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:16,930
anymore and she leaves. That is why she can’t pay attention to the mother.

308
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:22,930
She does not want a contact because the suffering of the mother is affecting her too

309
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:30,630
much, actually. It is the opposite of what she says. She says, I don’t want to help her.

310
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:42,340
It is because she feels the pain of the mother and makes her too sensitive.

311
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:50,850
Have I understood a little bit of the case, what do you think?

312
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:56,260
-A little bit.

313
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:05,930
-I was thinking about Staphysagria. More than Causticum in her case.

314
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:20,440
-Why it’s not Staphysagria? There is one point which she mentions and does not go

315
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:26,930
with Staphysagria. Which is this point? And goes for Causticum. Very strong point.

316
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:34,180
-When she was talking, she kept emphasizing how terrible she finds injustice.

317
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:39,180
She kept emphasing the fact of injustice.

318
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:47,680
-That we said. That is one point. One more point which you heard?

319
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,600
-Desire for salt.

320
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:59,350
-Desire for salt, such strong desire we don’t see in Staphysagria, we see in Causticum.

321
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:08,510
So the unfairness with the desire for salt it makes a case of Causticum, especially

322
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:14,510
because in the past Causticum seem to have an effect.

323
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:30,740
Now the main thing is injustice, desire for salt and then this intensity. It is a deep

324
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:40,490
Causticum case. I said OK if we give Causticum and acts, then we are lucky.

325
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:47,740
Also the fact that she behaves in this way with the mother, according to my

326
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:53,670
understanding, is because she is too much affected by her suffering.

327
00:34:53,770 --> 00:35:00,830
She sees the suffering of her mother, I have this, I have that, help me.

328
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:08,590
That makes her feel very … You don’t believe it? It doesn’t matter.

329
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:16,080
-It’s also a physical area where her pathology is manifesting and I’m talking about

330
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:24,590
the joints. This slow weakening of memory, of eye sight, these are points which speak

331
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:27,840
for Causticum.

332
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:43,090
-Causticum is in pathology affecting the small joints especially. And also the slowing of

333
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:49,840
the memory.

334
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:57,750
-This feeling as if the bones were broken in the joints is a Causticum symptom

335
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,000
-Did you find it?

336
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:15,410
-Yes, it’s there. 10 remedies, one of them is Causticum.

337
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:31,420
-If I did not shout, you would never get anything.

338
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:51,420
You will see me sometimes doing that in despair.

339
00:36:51,520 --> 00:37:11,420
Let’s see now the potency. Who suggests a low potency, under 30? One.

340
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:30,170
Who gives 200? 1M? 10M? 50M? CM?

341
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:41,420
In such a case you have to go high and wait and wait, don’t repeat in this case.

342
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:57,830
10M is high enough, you can try one time 10M.

343
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:04,840
-Just ask you which level would you give her in this?

344
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:15,840
-Third group in the middle towards the bottom.

345
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:30,170
Now in this condition she is in her mind, it is because of wrong treatment.

346
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:38,400
For me she could have been perfectly now with that original Causticum, if it was left

347
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:44,090
to act, I think.

348
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:49,330
-I would like to know why you don’t want to repeat?

349
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:58,340
-She is in a confused state. The organism is in a confused state.

350
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,090
So you give one remedy to see if the reaction will come.

351
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:11,340
If you repeat, this confused organism which receives this information as something

352
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:22,580
similar, not similimum, then the repetition will just modify some symptoms with no

353
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,580
real effect.

354
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:34,460
So you have to see if your choice of one remedy the organism is responding.

355
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:48,470
Because she is in a precarious situation. Her mind is quite broken down.

356
00:39:48,570 --> 00:40:05,220
I would not say she is group 4 but she is middle 3. And you will see also how long

357
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:17,150
you have to let these remedies act before the patient will tell you, I’m better.

358
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:31,550
In such cases, you get a feedback in 1 month and they say mmm…

359
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:39,970
In 2 months mmm…, in 3 months mmm… and then if you have the courage to wait

360
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:52,960
after a year, you will see the organism coming back to order.

361
00:40:53,060 --> 00:41:02,710
Who will do that?

362
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:07,440
-I want to understand why in this case we have to wait so long?

363
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:14,880
I remember last time in the case of Lilium tigrinum you waited, I think 3-4 days and you

364
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,300
said, forget it and we gave another remedy.

365
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,300
-Yes.

366
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,800
-It is because she is in the group 3 or because the mental state is so ill?

367
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:35,300
-The mental state is very disturbed deeply. Deep disturbance in mental level

368
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:45,550
you have to wait. Deep depression also, you wait.

369
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:02,020
reaction and the patients are very suffering and they urge you to do something.

370
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:09,880
Could it be a possibility to maybe give them Causticum in a D12 for example?

371
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:16,130
-If you find the correct remedy, you give it. But if you don’t see the correct remedy

372
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,580
you better leave it. This is the idea.

373
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:27,460
I don’t say don’t give the remedy. Give the correct remedy. It will help but be sure that

374
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:37,000
this is the correct remedy. You can. You may repeat, as long as it is the correct remedy.
