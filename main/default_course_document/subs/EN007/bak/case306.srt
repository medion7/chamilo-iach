1
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:34,570
-This is a child 15 years old and he was born weighted almost 11 pounds and 2 and half

2
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:43,070
years old got a flu in combination with diarrhea which never stopped. After several weeks

3
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:53,570
he was not given milk anymore and the diarrhea symptoms disappeared. From 5 years

4
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:01,070
old approximately till he was 8 or 9, he had ear inflammation and he was given antibiotics

5
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:10,340
many times. He has not had ear infections after he got diabetic symptoms 9 years old.

6
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:17,830
This is very interesting because the report was written before the teaching of the class.

7
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,070
It exactly confirms what it has been told.

8
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:32,020
His father was a sportsman, Alexander also was a sportsman. Alexander always liked to

9
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:41,990
stay at home and read and be together with pets, prepare food, find flowers. He prefers

10
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,990
to have friends at home and being with them at home. With the blood sugar level over a

11
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:56,240
period of time he has been stable between 7 and 10, he is more open for appointments

12
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,240
outside.

13
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:08,740
His juvenile diabetes was discovered at what age? When you had the first blood

14
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,490
examination and you saw that his blood sugar was high?

15
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,990
-In 1981.

16
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:25,240
-That means when he was 8 years old and what was the blood sugar during that time?

17
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:44,560
-25. When he comes to the hospital (?) so they were not sure if he had diabetes or if it

18
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,310
was just an accident.

19
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:49,820
-And when they became sure? At what age?

20
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,310
-After some days.

21
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:02,020
-And then they gave him how many milligrams of insulin?

22
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:09,230
-14 units the day.

23
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:13,480
-And now how much insulin he takes?

24
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:28,230
-It depends, about 16-18.

25
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,010
-By injection?

26
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,590
-Yes.

27
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:39,180
-The last thing they said about insulin is that they try to find a way to give it with a spray.

28
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:55,850
-He used something which is not a needle but a pressure in the ear.

29
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:08,830
-A pump. As I see here, Alexander got diabetic diagnosis and he was diagnosed by a

30
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:15,760
homeopath. At that time he injected 14 units of insulin per day, after some (?) his need

31
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:25,550
for insulin increased. His symptoms, he sweated a lot. He still sweats now?

32
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,050
-Yes.

33
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:34,050
-A lot, like you used to?

34
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,050
-No.

35
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,550
-Where do you sweat?

36
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:48,050
-Here. In the forehead.

37
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,050
-Mostly in the forehead.

38
00:04:50,150 --> 00:05:02,540
-Yes and on the feet.

39
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:09,800
-Very red in face after sporting, he has always been drinking especially cold milk in the

40
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:19,990
first years. Always liked smoked fish and meat. Very friend of animals. Likes to read 1-2

41
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:32,650
hours a day. Alexander got a few fissures. Where did you get the fissures?

42
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,400
-In the rectum.

43
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,900
-Or beside, near.

44
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:54,540
-And he took Medorrhinum 200, it was the first remedy, 10 in water. The symptoms from

45
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:04,000
the fissures changed from a big sore and red area to a more limited area like a swollen

46
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:12,980
ball near the rectum. He had gastric fluid and needed 16 units of insulin. The homeopath

47
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:20,010
tried Thuja 200, Alexander got pains in his stomach at once. I didn’t feel very fit in

48
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:25,760
general. The fissure was extremely painful. He was sent to hospital and operated.

49
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,680
It was severe?

50
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:41,180
-Very severe because I waited some days and went to another doctor allopathic and they

51
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,170
wanted us to go to the hospital but the homeopath said wait.

52
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:50,680
-It was very painful after stool the fissure?

53
00:06:50,780 --> 00:07:14,840
-All the time. And they said it’s very dangerous and it may go in the blood system.

54
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:25,840
-He had often inflammation of his throat and had several appointments with doctor Bruce.

55
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,500
He recommended Phosphorus and proposed D30 for 1 week. He was bleeding from his

56
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,980
nose for 1 week and became good again in his throat. In addition the blood sugar level

57
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,000
went down.

58
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:47,470
So when he got Phosphorus D30 for 1 week, he started bleeding from his nose.

59
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:59,730
-Yes and every time when he is tired, he starts bleeding, in the night.

60
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:10,640
-Epistaxis in the night.

61
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:20,890
After this he gave him Phos. 30 several times when he doesn’t feel well. His body has

62
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:29,220
reached by increasing the blood sugar level after 5-6 hours and increasing level another

63
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:36,500
10-15 hours later. He had often given him Phos. when he suffers from flu etc.

64
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:42,230
So whenever you give him Phos., it seems to act and help him.

65
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:57,220
-Yes.

66
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,220
-His allopathic doctor is very surprised that he is not using more insulin, than described

67
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:13,840
above, that’s quite unusual. In January this year Alexander went to another homeopath.

68
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:20,570
He gave him Bacillinum 200, the blood sugar raised and he got much hurt in the throat.

69
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:34,830
He tried LΜ potencies and had to take more insulin and felt bad. In February he got Calc.

70
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:42,820
carb. 200 and then after 30 and LM he became better in the throat, the blood sugar was

71
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:50,940
stabilized but did not fall. This is the end of the case.

72
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,640
-Yes.

73
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,650
-And here is Alexander the Great.

74
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,900
-Yes but he has had…

75
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,260
-Do you know who is Alexander the Great?

76
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,010
-Yes.

77
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,510
-Who?

78
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:21,000
No, why do you say yes? Alexander was the great general of the Greek army by these

79
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:36,760
ancient times 300 b.c., he conquered half of the world. So you can do the same, similar.

80
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:45,270
Megas Alexandros, Alexander the Great.

81
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:59,740
So you give us a great problem also, as you know. I want to ask you how do you feel.

82
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,850
-Good.

83
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,350
-Good, happy?

84
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,850
-Yes.

85
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,100
-Do you like reading? -Yes.

86
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,600
-What? Comics?

87
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:22,760
-Comics and romance.

88
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:29,260
-Just novels or historic what?

89
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:41,680
-He likes to read history? No he does not. You go to school?

90
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,880
-Yes.

91
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:50,090
-What class are you? 5,6, 8?

92
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,580
-9.

93
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,040
-Between your class you are in the front, in the middle or in the back?

94
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,260
-In the front.

95
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:14,000
-Not sitting in the front.

96
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,260
-In the front.

97
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:23,260
-Also. Your marks are high?

98
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,170
-Yes.

99
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:34,910
-Very good. Do you like your hair style?

100
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,910
-Yes.

101
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:42,900
-It is always like this or it is because in Alonissos you have to be different.

102
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:52,580
-Always like this.

103
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,830
-Are you shy?

104
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,330
-A little.

105
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:07,500
-Not very much. If your teacher calls you to tell the class, you will speak? If he tells you

106
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:15,990
to come up and say, Alexander come and tell us history or physics, you get up and you

107
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,750
can say the lesson of the day?

108
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,490
-Yes.

109
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:35,990
-You don’t feel timid, shy? He has difficulties in English, find the English word. Do you

110
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,240
understand my English?

111
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:51,250
-Yes.

112
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,240
-Do you like sweets?

113
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,240
-Yes.

114
00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:01,990
-Do you eat? How much? Does he eat sweets?

115
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,740
-Sometimes.

116
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,740
-He likes very much, he says, I want sweets.

117
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:18,490
-No, small. Fruits he likes better.

118
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:25,740
-What kind of fruit do you like most? -Grapes.

119
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:35,490
-What else? –All.

120
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:44,740
-But do you like unripe fruits, like green fruits which is sour.

121
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,910
-No, yes.

122
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,910
-No or yes?

123
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:51,940
-Yes.

124
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,150
-Do you understand sour?

125
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:02,160
-Yes.

126
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:09,910
-He eats a lot of fruits all day.

127
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:17,290
-Is he very active, is he hyper active you would say?

128
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:22,260
-No but he plays football.

129
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,510
-He has a lot of energy?

130
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,010
-It depends on the sugar level.

131
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:41,760
-If he is on high level, how is his energy, it goes down very much? He feels tired and can

132
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,930
not think?

133
00:15:46,030 --> 00:16:17,170
-Not so much. Today he had high, 16 when he woke up, in the morning. 12 o’clock.

134
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,170
-He woke up 12 o’clock, why?

135
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:26,170
-We were travelling yesterday 4 o’clock in the morning.

136
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,660
-He doesn’t do it every day.

137
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,420
-No.

138
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,170
-What time he goes to bed?

139
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,160
-10 o’clock.

140
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,460
-Your sleep is good?

141
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:46,180
-Yes.

142
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:53,430
-Can you tell me if you feel better in cold weather or in warm weather, which you like

143
00:16:53,530 --> 00:17:03,750
best? You like in the cold like Norway or you like to be in warm climate.

144
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:06,280
-…

145
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:18,070
-You don’t know. You can tolerate, cold it’s OK or warm? You are not bothered by warm?

146
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:24,580
-Yes, I don’t like it if it’s very warm.

147
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:30,710
-Then you perspire?

148
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,420
-Yes.

149
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,430
-Where?

150
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,170
-In the forehead.

151
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:49,920
-OK you remember you told me the first time the same. It’s very important.

152
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:57,680
Have you noticed if he is anxious about his health?

153
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:09,670
-He is interested, yes but he has some…

154
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,670
-He asks what is this in an anxious manner?

155
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:40,440
-Not so anxious. But for a child he comes and say what is it. He is not anxious about this.

156
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:46,610

-Grilled.

165
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,670
-Not smoked meat, it’s not your best food.

166
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,670
-No.

167
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,920
-Eggs do you like? –Yes.

168
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,920

-Fried.

171
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:02,340
-Boiled you don’t like or you can take?

172
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,580

173
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,830
-But you prefer fried. –Yes.

174
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:21,750
-When you wake up in the morning you feel good or you don’t want to talk to anybody?

175
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:27,500
-I feel good.

176
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,170
-It’s true what he says?

177
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:50,170
-Sometimes when he has slept long in the morning to 10-11, he feels tired.

178
00:20:50,270 --> 00:21:06,770
-Though he has slept longer he feels more tired. It’s true, you can confirm that?

179
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:13,020
-Yes.

180
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:22,020
-You sleep in a position on your left side, right side, back, forward?

181
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,780
-Right side.

182
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,520
-Which is your right side? Show me.

183
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,270
-There.

184
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,530
-This is the left.

185
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:36,270
-Then left.

186
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:47,360
-This is the left, really that side? Because you said right but you showed the left? So what

187
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,600
is finally?

188
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,270
-The left side.

189
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,270
-Is that, you confirm?

190
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:18,190
-He changes.

191
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:23,190
-He had any skin eruption in younger age?

192
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:32,140
-He has something in his hand, he loses skin.

193
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,350
-What do you mean?

194
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,350
-It’s coming off.

195
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:46,270
-The skin. Your palm is sweating now?

196
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,470
-No.

197
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:54,680
-But the skin comes off. A lot?

198
00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:01,680
-Not so much.

199
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,640
-Your nails are strong? -Yes.

200
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,850
-They don’t break. –No.

201
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:25,020
-Do you bite them? –Sometimes, his father bites them.

202
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:34,960
-You are his mother? –Yes but he's likes his father. He's very alike him.

203
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,800
-You say you bite them.

204
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,800
-Yes but not all the time.

205
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:48,550
-Do you know when you bite them? When you are anxious?

206
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,550
-When I feel fear.

207
00:23:51,650 --> 00:24:06,470
-I see.

208
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:20,220
Do you take normal salt or you take the salt and you put extra salt in your food?

209
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,210
-I take more salt.

210
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:30,460
-Is that true?

211
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:39,720
-No. It’s not so much. He says on eggs.

212
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,640
-Only on eggs and tomato?

213
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,700
-No, I don’t eat tomato.

214
00:24:46,800 --> 00:25:02,420
-Oh you don’t like tomato? Now we catch you. What else you don’t like?

215
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:34,420
-Mustard, sour cream.

216
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:44,360
-Onions? Raw onions?

217
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,110
-Not raw.

218
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:56,870
-You don’t like raw onions, why? If you eat what happens?

219
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,980
-I don’t know. I’ll try.

220
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,200
-I don’t think he has tried.

221
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,360
-You don’t have it in your country?

222
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,190
-We don’t use it so much.

223
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:12,950
-I see. Cheese you like?

224
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:17,450
-Yes.

225
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,900
-According to you what he likes to eat?

226
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:40,730
-Cheese and fruit and bread, he eats everything but he doesn’t like sweets on the bread.

227
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:58,910
We don’t use that.

228
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:05,410
-Fish you like? -Yes.

229
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,110
-He likes fish? –Yes.

230
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:21,160
-Very much? –Yes, he likes fried best.

231
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:29,150
-When you sleep do you have saliva running out of your mouth into the pillow?

232
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:35,900
-No, never.

233
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,360
-No ear infections at all now?

234
00:27:40,460 --> 00:28:00,000
-Now he get it if he swims under the water. And we are in a plane he has problem.

235
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,010
-He stammers at all?

236
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:12,510
-No.

237
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:26,000
-Do you have any fears? Are you afraid of something?

238
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:32,410
-Dogs barking.

239
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,330
-You are afraid of dogs?

240
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:40,420
-No, if they are barking only.

241
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,410
-Cats? -No.

242
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:47,420
-You don’t mind. -That’s OK.

243
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,670
-What about big animals, cows? -That’s OK.

244
00:28:52,770 --> 00:29:04,160
-Only dogs. Are you afraid of anything else? In the night if they leave you at home?

245
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,860
-That’s OK.

246
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:18,580
-So you are courageous and if they leave you alone in the night and then you have to go

247
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,080
to bed, you switch off the light or you keep the light?

248
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,080
-Switch off.

249
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:35,830
-Dark, no problem. It’s true?

250
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:51,830
-I don’t think he has left alone, he has never being alone sleeping but his elder brother

251
00:29:51,930 --> 00:30:03,330
he has been at home, he has not been alone at home.

252
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,500
-Do you smoke cigarettes?

253
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:17,660
-No.

254
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,690
-According to you what they say, in the class he is in the normal class? In the school he

255
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:31,160
should be in class 9 and he is in class 8 or back or forward?

256
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,950
-He is forward.

257
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:48,610
-So in the school they say he is quite intelligent. And you are happy about that?

258
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,110
-Yes.

259
00:30:52,210 --> 00:31:05,820
-In mathematics when he was smaller he got one class higher.

260
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:16,580
-He likes mathematics. Do you play in theater plays? Do you like it?

261
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,830
-No.

262
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:26,080
-You are shy, you don’t want to appear in front of the public?

263
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,330
-No.

264
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:39,000
-But here you are doing very well. You seem to enjoy, no problem.

265
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:47,590
-They ask if he was nervous before all this and he said, I don’t think about it.

266
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:54,340
-He was not nervous.

267
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,300
You want to ask me some questions?

268
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,300
-No.

269
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,310
-Why, are you afraid of me?

270
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:05,260
-No.

271
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,720
-But you don’t have any question.

272
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:30,800
-He has one tooth that is not coming out. It isn’t there, it’s missing.

273
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,300
-That’s why he has to close his tooth.

274
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,810
-Yes.

275
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:48,810
-Except of the insulin which he takes now, you give him other medication regularly?

276
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:49,810
-No.

277
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:57,230
-If he gets an acute, who treats him?

278
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:11,960
-Now I did. When he gets something in his childhood I gave him Phos. but I think I’m not

279
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:27,150
so good, maybe I go to other homeopath and he gives another one but that’s new and he has not

280
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:44,230
had acute after that. But I ask if I can give him Phos.

281
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,800
-Can you describe his character?

282
00:33:48,900 --> 00:34:15,010
-He is very gentle and helpful and I don’t have a problem with him because he does what

283
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,960
I like.

284
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,010
-What you like.

285
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,270
-Yes.

286
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,310
-He is not naughty?

287
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:24,300
-No.

288
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,560
-If you tell him, stop playing football he will come in and stop?

289
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:51,070
-Yes. He has very good humor. He is joking with me when I say come.

290
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:59,570
-What does he say?

291
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:12,500
-He doesn’t make problems, he never make problems. When he was a little boy he was

292
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:23,130
around the house, he never go away, he was always playing just outside the house and

293
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:37,690
I was not never afraid of him because he was not and me on the house.

294
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:50,510
If he does something we don’t like, if my husband is angry on him he doesn’t like that,

295
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:59,760
then he got angry.

296
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:04,020
-Then how he reacts, when he gets angry?

297
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:22,260
-He smashes the door or he won’t speak to us, go to his room and won’t speak.

298
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,260
-He closes the door and doesn’t want any contact.

299
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,520
-Yes.

300
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:37,060
-If you try to console him and say come on, he doesn’t like, he says leave me alone?

301
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,060
-Yes.

302
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,010
-Like this, strong?

303
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:48,140
-Yes.

304
00:36:48,240 --> 00:37:01,900
-Do you sit under the sun? Do you like it or you don’t like it?

305
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:09,390
-Not too much.

306
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:18,940
-Why? It makes you tired or headache?

307
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,360
-Nothing happens so he doesn’t want to lie under the sun. He wants something to

308
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,860
happen.

309
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:32,110
-Action? He needs action?

310
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:51,860
-Yes.

311
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,110
-Do you have any pains, any suffering somewhere?

312
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:58,110
-No.

313
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:04,110
-In stomach sometimes.

314
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:09,850
-Pain in digestion?

315
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:24,360
-Pain here in the abdomen.

316
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:31,860
-His stool is normal?

317
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:37,610
-Yes.

318
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,800
-He says yes, I don’t know.

319
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,530
-You don’t have diarrhea? -No.

320
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:51,280
-Stool formed? –Yes.

321
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,250
-And you are a very good boy, according to you, you are good?

322
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,210
-Yes.

323
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:02,880
-And your brother? –Too.

324
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:16,380
-They are equally good or not so good? What would you say about your children?

325
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,130
-For me all are…

326
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:25,650
-All of them are obedient, like him?

327
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:39,630
-No, he is special in that. He and the sister for me. He has a sister too.

328
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,830
-And himself and the sister…

329
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:47,380
-Yes but mostly him.

330
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,830
-Do you like both your parents, mother and father the same or more you like one?

331
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:58,660
-The same.

332
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:06,620
-But your father if he says something, then you become irritable, your mother said.

333
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:18,830
Do you understand what I ask? Is it true?

334
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:35,900
-I think it’s because his father is pressing me more direct, more than me, I go around

335
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:55,400
all the time. I always if something is wrong.

336
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:03,160
-In your family or his father family there is any diabetes?

337
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:22,770
-Only the father, he has diabetes when he was 32. He got the same type when he was 32

338
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,480
and that’s very seldom.

339
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,470
-So both they receive insulin?

340
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:35,440
-Yes but nobody else in the family.

341
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:39,690
-In your family your parents are alive? –Yes.

342
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,150
-His parents?

343
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:51,110
-Only the mother. The father died from heart attack and it’s a lot of heart attack in that

344
00:41:51,210 --> 00:42:07,770
family. The mother has angina.
