1
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:48,530
I want to give you now a case and a remedy, it is a very well known remedy.

2
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,660
I’m no kidding, it’s a very well known remedy.

3
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:15,530
This is a 67 years old lady who came on 1978, beginning of 78.

4
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,860
-January?

5
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:30,610
-I say beginning because the date of the first interview is not written, so I look at the

6
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:42,860
second interview, which is the 4th of April, so it is the end of February.

7
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:59,860
Always you are concerned with the dates. It’s only him who asks, interesting.

8
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:12,610
It says that at night when she goes to sleep, she feels a noise as if somebody is breathing

9
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:21,970
on her face. She hears a noise and she feels the breathing and that goes down to her

10
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:44,720
stomach that starts pulsating. That symptomatology started 3 years ago.

11
00:02:46,490 --> 00:03:02,640
She has tremendous nightmares where she sees ugly people making love to her and

12
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:23,980
frequently now she hears a voice in her ear to say names, John, Paul and this happens as

13
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,060
soon as she lies down.

14
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:40,890
Forgets very easily, she says I go to the kitchen to take something and as soon as I am in

15
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:52,140
the kitchen, I forget what did I come here for, forgets names of known persons, of relatives,

16
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,000
friends.

17
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:17,640
Her hearing is very bad on both sides and she has noises like bells and buzzing noises.

18
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:31,390
That is worse in the night, when she lies down.

19
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:47,390
She has stitches in her heart region and she has itching on the genitalia and on the

20
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:59,900
elbows, with intense itching and scratches until it bleeds, underlined 3 times, worse in the

21
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,890
night underlined twice and worse in the morning underlined twice and worse in warm

22
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,890
underlined once.

23
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:42,560
She is very much aggravated by heat underlined 3 times but cold weather brings up pains

24
00:05:42,660 --> 00:06:00,070
in the ears. She is generally better in the sea underlined 3 times, cloud weather brings

25
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:06,160
about sadness.

26
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:22,060
Appetite is good. Everything she can eat but if she eats eggs she will have headaches and

27
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:41,390
allergies, desires milk, desires sweets underlined twice, drinks normal water but if she

28
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:49,350
drinks cold water, then she has pain in the stomach.

29
00:06:49,450 --> 00:07:03,690
Sleeplessness, many thoughts that keep her awake, sleeps on the right side, feet are cold

30
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:13,130
and numbed.

31
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:22,600
A very well known remedy, don’t forget that, otherwise you make mistakes.

32
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:40,190
Very easily irritated underlined twice, no jealousy, weeps very easily and that relieves her

33
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:52,030
underlined 3 times, wants consolation no underline.

34
00:07:52,130 --> 00:08:07,080
Fear of thunderstorms underlined twice and fear of loneliness.

35
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:23,510
Fear of dogs underlined once but she was bitten once by a cat.

36
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:31,270
That’s interesting she has fear of dogs but she has been bitten by a cat.

37
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:41,420
She did have the anti-rabies injection by that time.

38
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:56,670
Perspires a lot in the head and the perspiration is very offensive.

39
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:05,160
In the past history there is malaria which is not said when and

40
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:17,020
 there is gonorrhea again in young age but it doesn’t say at what age.

41
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:29,000
That’s the case and this time I have not kept any information.

42
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:46,080
As far as her diagnosis is concerned what is happening allopathically?

43
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:56,660
She has acoustic delusions, she hears voices, she has other delusions feeling that

44
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:08,240
somebody is breathing in her face. If you put all this together, what she has?

45
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,490
-Arteriosclerosis.

46
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:21,500
-Arteriosclerosis, that is what it must be, putting together all the symptomatology we have

47
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:30,830
arteriosclerosis case. You don’t agree? What do you say?

48
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:56,820
Tell us. Can this be a mental case? It looks as if it can be a serious mental case of

49
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:03,660
schizophrenia?

50
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:25,360
You have to put down the loss of hearing in both ears, the loss of memory, forgets very

51
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:34,910
easily, the delusions together with the nightmares.

52
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:43,160
This symptomatology for me will indicate definitely an arteriosclerosis state, especially the

53
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,170
nightmares.

54
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:53,910
If you see a continuous series of nightmares in old people over 70, you expect a brain

55
00:11:54,010 --> 00:12:03,920
stroke, soon if they don’t go into a strict diet, if they don’t take Homeopathy, especially if

56
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:17,510
the blood pressure is high.

57
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:42,990
Has anybody found that first symptom, somebody is breathing in her face?

58
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:58,580
After all this elaborate thinking, see what has happened.

59
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:11,510
She comes a month later, on the beginning of April 78 and she says I am the same and

60
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,910
she describes again the sensation.

61
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:37,410
She says I feel when I lie down that something is walking on my forehead, she describes it

62
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:46,160
in a different manner and then it starts a buzzing in the ears and

63
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,410
then I have a pulsation in the stomach, and then on the umbilicus.

64
00:13:50,510 --> 00:14:04,240
There is a slight difference in describing the sensation but one month later she appears to

65
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:20,250
be the same, not worse and she is better if I put some warm application in umbilicus.

66
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:49,500
Many times I have been impatient but something is fluttering in the left ear.

67
00:14:49,600 --> 00:15:03,580
The itching had been much worse and still is the same as before.

68
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:17,580
The buzzing in the ears, the noises in the ears continue.

69
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:32,090
Still she is aggravated by heat, now it is underlined twice but she says the fears are less,

70
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:46,410
she had fear of loneliness which is very strong underlined and fear of thunderstorms.

71
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:53,000
I don’t think she is talking about fear of thunderstorms but maybe.

72
00:15:53,100 --> 00:16:17,740
Sleep comes easier but on the whole I feel more strong and psychologically I’m better.

73
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:24,750
What is your assessment here?

74
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:38,080
What are you going to do? Desires and aversions are the same.

75
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,830
-Wait.

76
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:52,330
-Who wants to wait? Who is in favor of waiting? My good students.

77
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:59,570
Very few homeopaths would wait like this and would try to give something else. The

78
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:06,440
sensation has changed now, let’s give something, whatever it is.

79
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:13,190
-Maybe we wait too long.

80
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:25,180
-Sometimes that is a bad thing.

81
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:45,020
So we lost that case, she didn’t appear again, so the report ends here but I believe she

82
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:55,020
must have been better and that’s why she didn’t come back.

83
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,270
-She would be one of those people that would drop a level?

84
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:10,350
-Yes I think so because it would be no big aggravation. She may stay and I think 78 is

85
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:32,360
already 4 years, maybe she would still wait if she did not antidote.

86
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:40,940
-1M.

87
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:58,190
-You don’t have further records but I believe it’s a good reaction.

88
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:04,190
Nobody wants to challenge that statement?

89
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:10,850
You are convinced that she is going to be well?

90
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,400
-No.

91
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,010
-Why don’t you say so? It’s because I say she will be well, you believe it?

92
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,260
-Nobody wants to argue.

93
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:38,050
-I don’t think that…  really bothers her… She says she is psychologically better.

94
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,930
Who can believe that?

95
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:42,180
-Who can believe that?

96
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,350
-No aggravation.

97
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:53,930
-You can’t expect her…

98
00:19:54,030 --> 00:20:04,430
-There is some pathology underneath the symptoms, it’s going to take some time

99
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:10,680
before it’s fixed.

100
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:23,780
It did get worse but after a time, a month, the skin is still quite bad.

101
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,670
-It is unusual to give 1M to somebody at that age?

102
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:35,170
-Not unusual.

103
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:48,920
-…Do you expect that any psychological or emotional problems would get worse first?

104
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:57,920
-Yes definitely. What is due to the pathology I would expect to take some time though, I’m

105
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:09,420
sorry I think I missed one phrase. She said she didn’t hear anymore delusions, she had no

106
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,170
more delusions or voices.

107
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,170
-Ahhh.

108
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,670
-Now you are more sure?

109
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:43,250
My opinion is that she must be well, otherwise she would have come back.

110
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,000
-The nightmares?

111
00:21:46,100 --> 00:22:00,000
-Yes that’s another information, sleep is easier but she still has the dream that somebody

112
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:08,750
is after her and that she is fighting with him.

113
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:19,250
After that information are you sure? Who is sure that this lady is doing well?

114
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:22,450
-Today?

115
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:26,920
-Very few.

116
00:22:27,020 --> 00:23:00,750
OK, the lady came back…on 5th of July 1982. It was 1978 the first time, 4th of April the

117
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:13,700
second visit, the third visit is on 5 of July 1982, it’s 4 years and something.

118
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:30,170
She says the 4 years and something I’m doing very well but there is a relapse and she has

119
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,610
exactly the same thing.

120
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:50,840
She says again I have the feeling of human breathing and I heard a noise on the left ear

121
00:23:50,940 --> 00:24:00,830
and that had started slowly since a few months ago when I had a breaking of my leg.

122
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:07,870
She broke her leg, she went to the hospital and she took some medication and slowly she

123
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:13,340
started deteriorating.

124
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:24,250
Eventually the whole thing came back, the itching is as it used to be.

125
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:34,830
Frequently I have bad mood and I don’t want to do anything, I’m lazy and I complain about

126
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:51,830
my complains, memory is bad and again I weep very easily. Fear that something may

127
00:24:51,930 --> 00:25:08,590
happen to me if I’m by myself. Acoustical delusions again, sleep does not come easily

128
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:34,590
from excitement and thoughts. Lying on the left side I have dyspnea, the hearing is bad

129
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:43,370
Desires and aversions: desires fruits underlined twice, rice underlined twice, cheese

130
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:50,880
underlined twice, meat underlined twice.

131
00:25:50,980 --> 00:26:01,620
She loves the open air underlined 3 times and feels the heat underlined 3 times, loves

132
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:15,870
the seas underlined twice, fears have come back.

133
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:24,370
Now what shall we do? Do you think we shall change the remedy or give the same

134
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:33,080
remedy?

135
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:43,090
-The same remedy.

136
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,420
-That’s a big decision.

137
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,700
-How can she relapse within two months time?

138
00:26:48,800 --> 00:27:10,670
-Not too months, a few months after the broken leg. She broke her leg…

139
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:21,170
5-6 months is a good space of time that she can become again…

140
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:29,850
You see the clearing of the arteries will be of minimal time just to free her of her

141
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:34,850
symptomatology. It’s not the arteries are free and then they are again. It’s just enough to

142
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:42,440
free from a few symptoms and then within a few months that process can reverse,

143
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:47,940
definitely within 5-6 months.

144
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,440
She looks again like Pulsatilla, especially with the desire for cheese that has been added

145
00:27:53,540 --> 00:28:03,460
now. If you see desire cheese Pulsatilla is there. Again it looks like Pulsatilla and what

146
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:09,470
shall we do? Shall we now try Pulsatilla? This is the question.

147
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:15,440
Between that choice that you have a little bit change in the case, it will change you in

148
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:22,020
another remedy, the rest is practically the same. Are you going to change the remedy?

149
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,270
-No.

150
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:35,020
-The rule is no. If your remedy has helped and has helped in this case tremendously, this

151
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,520
woman must have been a woman of these types that don’t go frequently to doctors,

152
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:50,850
otherwise she would have relapse much earlier and she kept a kind of balance all these

153
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,860
years and she was free of symptoms.

154
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:04,190
She didn’t jump a level and you can see now real reaction but that kept her going quite a

155
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:16,270
lot and that’s enough for a lady who kept 67 and she comes at 71, 4 years free of

156
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:42,600
symptomatology is good, I don’t think she could do better with another remedy.

157
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,350
I’ve given 1M because there is a relapse due to medicines she took, there was an

158
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:53,610
antidotal process.

159
00:29:53,710 --> 00:30:16,360
There is one more symptom which comes to confirm.

160
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:26,860
It is now that she has burning of the soles in the feet and uncover them.

161
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:44,180
Burning of the soles is not Pulsatilla, burning of the soles of the feet is Sulphur.

162
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:55,690
Many people don’t have the experience and they understand and they don’t enjoy this kind

163
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,180
of analysis.

164
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:09,180
-No, no, I went back and I repertorized the whole thing very carefully and it’s really from

165
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:25,940
the repertorization and the original case, Sulphur is a little stronger but Pulsatilla…

166
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:41,270
-I’ll give you a hint, because it was a skin eruption involved. When I have exactly the same

167
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:45,470
situation between Pulsatilla and Sulphur, then I take the pathology of the one in favor of

168
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:51,470
the other. I say this is the remedy which produces more easily the skin eruption. It is

169
00:31:51,570 --> 00:32:02,120
Sulphur, not so much Pulsatilla, that is the only differentiating point.

170
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,770
-She says scratching to bleeding.

171
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:16,020
-But I brought you another case yesterday scratching to bleeding and you noticed that

172
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:21,220
there was nothing in the Repertory but that’s why I bring you these cases.

173
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:28,220
Teaching means that you have to learn something from these cases and you can add it

174
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:39,260
in your Repertory, you can add Sulphur strong, capital in this rubric.

175
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:49,810
You see we are obsessed with the Repertory and outside people they call us fanatic, he is

176
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:56,560
a fanatic, Kent and all. Yet I believe that I see things objectively as much as I can and I see

177
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:04,350
also the work of Kent as much objectively as I can.

178
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:21,900
Kent brings his Repertory and the work of, I think 3 other doctors that have started this

179
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,150
work, it’s not his own personally. He supervised quite a lot and gave his own experience in

180
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:39,140
the Repertory but he could not have done everything and the Repertory is definitely lacking

181
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,090
information.

182
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:47,060
We need eventually to add up, like this you can add definitely.

183
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:53,900
Already today you saw two cases. I will not open the Repertory to see whether Sulphur

184
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,390
when scratches it will bleed. It will bleed because of the nature of Sulphur.

185
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:08,500
So therefore we will not rely on such information.
