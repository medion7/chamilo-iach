1
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,830
One of the cases that some of you have seen last year in Alonissos.

2
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:44,680
It is a retarded child, a mongoloid child and with epileptic convulsions.

3
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:59,590
It is one of those cases that when you see you don’t foretell much about their improvement.

4
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,090
They are very difficult cases to have any kind of improvement.

5
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,850
I will tell you a little bit of what you are not going to see in this

6
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,420
and the people who were there can confirm about it.

7
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,070
The child took a remedy, I don’t want to tell you the remedy now,

8
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:37,170
you will hear it after you see the case and I said give the remedy to potency of 30 or 200.

9
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,070
Because it was not a regular remedy could not be found.

10
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,450
Eventually telephone calls, different places and the remedy was found and it was given.

11
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:57,920
The potency that was found and was given, without my knowledge instead of 200, was CM.

12
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:08,570
CM is 100.000, it was a very high potency and for those that were present

13
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:16,570
and they remember the case, as I was analyzing another case,

14
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:24,070
the child had got the remedy the day before, somebody comes into the class

15
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:32,920
and says the child has a tremendous aggravation, it can not breathe and it’s blue.

16
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:52,070
What shall we do? It is one of these moments where you lose your mind

17
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:58,680
and you do whatever you can to save the child because the child is blue, it can not breathe.

18
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,010
It’s going to die in an hour or two, perhaps less.

19
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,000
But knowing what I know about Homeopathy, knowing that the remedy was the correct one,

20
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:25,150
I thought that if we support the child, with some support, like a little bit of oxygen,

21
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,750
most probably the child will get over it.

22
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,740
Everyone was amazed in the class to see me very cool and say, get a bottle of oxygen and

23
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,840
give him a little bit of oxygen. Everybody was trembling in the class.

24
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,490
The child did not actually need the bottle of oxygen because before they could find

25
00:03:53,590 --> 00:04:09,570
the bottle of oxygen, the child started recovering and you will see now the initial case

26
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:15,820
and I will show you, when I analyze the case, the different follow ups.

27
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,820
There are three follow ups from last year.

28
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:25,170
It’s about a whole year now of treatment and I will show you what took place all along the line.

29
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,090
We start the case from the beginning.

30
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:46,990
Also it is interesting to observe in this case, that the child has gotten different

31
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:56,440
homeopathic remedies before and you will say a bit better but not real action of the remedy.

32
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,690
When you give the right remedy, it’s another story always.

33
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:09,940
You give a remedy which is close, does something but the patient returns

34
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,190
back to the same situation.

35
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,750
You may be treating a person for two years and after two years you find he is exactly the same,

36
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:21,340
as you started. That means he never got the right remedy.

37
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:30,500
In all cases that are coming to me, usually they are coming after homeopathic treatment

38
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,340
and other treatments and this is the case with that child.

39
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,740
So we’ll hear the story by a New Zealander. The parents are now in New Zealand

40
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:49,040
and they just sent me last August the last taped follow up.

41
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,880
The husband is studying Homeopathy himself, so he will give the case himself.

42
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,380
-We have two other children, a daughter and we have a son who is adopted.

43
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:32,380
-So tell me the story what happened? What has been diagnosed as Down syndrome?

44
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,960
What is the problem with the child?

45
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,700
-He has Down syndrome, which is diagnosed and that’s not the problem.

46
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:53,440
The problem is that at six months he started to have infantile spasms, epilepsy

47
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,890
and from that point his growth and his development came to a standstill

48
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,850
and not just came to a standstill...

49
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:16,190
-Because most of the students are not English speaking, you have to speak slower and clearly.

50
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:24,840
You come from New Zealand and have a New Zealand accent as well; have that in mind also

51
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,440
because the whole class will go into spasms.

52
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:37,690
-I’ll try to speak like a Greek.
-Right, exactly, everybody understands a Greek.

53
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:55,340
-At six months his progress was almost the same as any normal six month old child

54
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,920
but it just stopped.
-Why?

55
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,870
-Apparently - we didn’t discover this until he was a year old - a child

56
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,720
that has infantine spasms, which are very rare, the development stops.

57
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,920
-But why he had these spasms according to your understanding? You have an explanation?

58
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,430
Why at six months he started having spasms, do you have an explanation?

59
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:23,420
-No. The only thing that we thought possibly it could have brought it on, was the heat.

60
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,950
It was in the middle of our summer and he had been very, very restless for two days

61
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,420
in the heat and we changed his bed to the coolest spot and he still had no energy

62
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,950
and then the spasms started, two days later.

63
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,700
-OK. Did he have any fever during that time?

64
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,200
-He was not sick at all, I was not concerned about his health, I was just concerned

65
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,260
about the heat.

66
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:54,100
-Heat seems to aggravate him quite a bit and even now the heat will increase the convulsions.

67
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,750
-So does he get fever ever?
-No.

68
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:09,870
-So far he has no fever. When he gets these spasms, what he does? Can you repeat?

69
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:19,480
-Well the spasms have now changed, they have become a grand mal, jerking and..

70
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,290
-Describe exactly what takes place.

71
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,420
-Can I show you?
-Yes.

72
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:47,790
-It comes up like this, it think it begins here. Everything comes out. (parent demonstrates)

73
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:52,040
-It is exactly like that. Every time the eyes go to the right.

74
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,870
-The eyes go always to the right and the head turns to the right.

75
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:04,230
-And the leg is in a real tight muscular position. The other one seems to stay all right.

76
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,560
-The first minute the breathing seems to stop?
-Yes.

77
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,840
-And as starts to breathe, he starts grasping breathe.

78
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:33,820
-But the first is to come together, to bend together and then expands and he turns to the right.

79
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,060
How long it lasts, the crisis?

80
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,560
-The crisis only a measure of minutes.

81
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,810
-Minutes or seconds?

82
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:51,260
- Minutes, three minutes but the… lasts for half an hour because he’s sleepy

83
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,260
and he is not completely conscious.

84
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,260
-For half an hour, he is not completely conscious and he has little jerks.

85
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,260
-After half an hour he is back to normal but it takes certain amount of time for him

86
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,360
to really come through it.

87
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:14,260
-As he comes out, he becomes very tired and sleepy and he would often go to sleep afterwards

88
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:24,260
but he has a great tiredness and then as he comes more and more out of it,

89
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,760
the twitching stops and then he comes around and is back to his normal state.

90
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:43,760
-But it always occurs after waking up, so it could after an hour when he wakes up

91
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,260
but normally half an hour after he wakes up.

92
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,780
-In the morning?
-In the morning and in the afternoon, after sleep.

93
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,110
-The crisis happens after sleep?
-Yes.

94
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:06,700
-And he is aggravated by heat.
-And stuffy conditions.

95
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,940
-It can be hot, as long as there’s a wind flowing over him, he’s ok.

96
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,440
-There is anything else?

97
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:38,600
-This form of epilepsy has only occurred in the last three days and then started the jerking

98
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,180
and only in the last month he had these grand mal convulsions.

99
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,580
-What remedies he has taken so far?
-You want me to run through them?

100
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,270
-Yes.

101
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:18,970
-We go back to the 15th of the 2nd 1986 with Epilim and he became really tired,

102
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:30,070
Epilim which is a form of medication for epilepsy, allopathic, yes

103
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,560
- For one month and then you took him off, why?

104
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:46,390
-Because he became very restless and he got Opium 200 and it had an effect.

105
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:52,430
We saw the effect, we saw it was good, so we took him off the medication

106
00:13:53,570 --> 00:14:03,480
and then he got Pulsatilla 200, which stopped the convulsions for one month

107
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:09,070
and they came back after a session of cranial massage.

108
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,730
- Cranial massage… by a cranial osteopath?
- Yes.

109
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,970
By the way it’s the only time he had a high temperature.

110
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:25,640
After the cranial massage he got an extremely high temperature, it’s the only time.

111
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,990
We took him to the hospital.

112
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,660
-It put the temperature to about 38 or something.

113
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,800
-Otherwise he never had high temperature. After this cranial massage,

114
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:45,800
the crisis continued and you repeated Pulsatilla?

115
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:56,400
-Yes, we repeated Pulsatilla 200 and he got Opium again and it was never taken any higher.

116
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,160
-The second time he took Pulsatilla, no effect and then Opium second time,

117
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,140
no effect?
-No.

118
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,390
-And then?

119
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,990
-Then he got Psorinum 1M and there was no reaction.

120
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,870
Then he got Electricitas 200 and after that…

121
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,880
-Why? Who gave this?

122
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:34,560
-At that stage we took him to [doctor’s name] in June.

123
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,060
He gave him Electricitas and then he gave him Medorrhinum.

124
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:49,710
He suffers from a rash in the genital area and the Medorrhinum had a big effect on that,

125
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,640
lasted for long time but now not.

126
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:58,960
-In the beginning he had a big aggravation in the rash?

127
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,960
-A long term, very bad.

128
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,960
-And then it did not affect the convulsions?

129
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:16,210
-It didn’t touch the convulsions. After that he got Baryta carbonica 10M.

130
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,560
Nothing.

131
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,270
-Baryta carbonica.

132
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:09,120
-I gave him a lot of potencies, different remedies. Pulsatilla, Cuprum 6C,

133
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:36,250
Aethusa 30 and 2.4.5T. This is a potency of a weed killer.

134
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:42,750
-He was diagnosed by this particular […]

135
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,620
-No effect?
-No reaction really.

136
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:20,500
We got to a point where he is wasting weight, not eating.

137
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,750
He is always consistently vomiting his food.

138
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:33,000
-Still today, continuously after eating, he just pulls out a mouthful

139
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,100
and then another mouthful and another mouthful.

140
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:44,750
And we discovered that in the days that he is more aggravated by this vomiting,

141
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,760
he doesn’t have the same amount of convulsions or he doesn’t have any convulsions.

142
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,590
-If he vomits?

143
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,870
-If he has a bad day, when he is sick all day, he doesn’t have convulsions.

144
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,870
-Otherwise the convulsions are every day?
-Every day.

145
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:05,970
-From 1 to 3 times.

146
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:16,620
-But we are not a 100% sure that he doesn’t have the convulsions when he vomits.

147
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,850
-This is an observation.
-Yes.

148
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,680
-Yesterday he was sick all day, he didn’t have any fits.

149
00:19:32,930 --> 00:20:01,180
-What do we see so far?
-Apis.

150
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:15,340
-What I asked is what do you see so far? You saw a picture here and I’m asking you

151
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:24,330
to describe what you have seen, what you would tell me. I have not seen the case,

152
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,680
you have seen it and you describe to me.

153
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:37,680
If you are able to describe the correct points, maybe you will be able to find the right remedy.

154
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:45,470
-The child is only concerned with himself.

155
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:56,120
-That’s correct. That’s very correct because still it has not been said

156
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,080
that the child has no contact at all.

157
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,840
If you talk to the child, the child will just pay no notice, doubtful whether he will

158
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:13,830
even see you, even notice; it’s an autistic child without any contact at all,

159
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:17,270
on top of that we have convulsions.

160
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,420
But when I ask you to describe what you have seen, what you will say?

161
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:36,170
I don’t want you to improvise so much, as to describe to me what you have heard and seen.

162
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,370
-He seems to be jerking…

163
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,070
-I do not know anything about the case, I have not seen the case.

164
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:57,290
You are describing to me the case. Tell me.

165
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:14,650
-Do you mind if I make a remark? I’m examining you, I’m giving you some examples.

166
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,500
I’m going to make some remarks about what you are saying. Do you mind?

167
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:41,950
-He sucks his right foot, throwing back himself in the chair and the arms seems to jerk a lot.

168
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,990
-He is salivating quite a lot.

169
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:14,990
-Blonde headed, blue eyed, chubby child.

170
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,240
-Do you come from Australia?
-Yes.

171
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,990
-We got her.

172
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,660
-Even when he vomits a lot, seems to put on weight.

173
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,990
-Somebody else?

174
00:23:45,400 --> 00:24:08,150
-A child who has epilepsy and at the same time is restless, autistic child, skin symptoms.

175
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,300
-He has almost chorea sometimes.

176
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,880
-If I was going to describe to you the case, what I would have said to you?

177
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:26,090
You have not seen the case and I’m going to describe to you the case.

178
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:37,240
I would describe to you what impressed me in the case. I would not use my imagination.

179
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,190
I would describe the same things as I heard.

180
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:49,300
What I heard and I have seen is that this is a very restless child with jerkings along that

181
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:56,300
but what impressed me is the description of the child when it has the convulsion.

182
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:04,800
The description which the father did, where the child makes all distortions and convulsions

183
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,730
and goes into spasm.

184
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:19,390
That is the description of the crisis and when I’m going to transmit to you the case,

185
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:27,920
I’m going to say this is a very restless child, without any contact with anybody,

186
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:35,390
sucking this thumb, having these jerks when during the time of real convulsions,

187
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:41,130
epileptic convulsions, what we see is kind of terrifying.

188
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:49,480
When the father describes the crisis, there is something, a feeling in you. You didn’t feel it?

189
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:08,380
All these convulsions and distortions. And the child is ameliorated by cool air

190
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,380
but what is impressive is the retardation of the child.

191
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,000
The child after six months started being retarded.

192
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:26,890
He was a mongoloid child, he was with Down syndrome but he seemed to be kind of well

193
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:33,970
until six months. At six months something took place and the child started being retarded.

194
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,450
There is no communication with the child at all and this is the description

195
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:48,050
that you are going to search in your Materia Medica, in order to fit the case with a remedy.

196
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:56,550
You ask yourself what kind of remedy would have this picture?

197
00:26:57,050 --> 00:27:01,950
This is the question we are searching for in this case. What is the type of remedy?

198
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:05,550
What is the remedy? Have you read your Materia Medica?

199
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:11,150
Yes, you may remember the remedy. You have not read it?

200
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,300
Search and search, in the Repertory is very difficult to find the remedy.

201
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,950
You have to read the Materia Medica right through. From A to Z.

202
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:29,640
A, B, C, D, E… nobody continues further than that, it’s impossible.

203
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:38,390
You have somebody to pour cold water on your head and say, continue, study.

204
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:47,470
I’ve been studying the whole Materia Medica perhaps for one case like that.

205
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:56,120
In the first years I read this Boericke Materia Medica, I read it right through when I bought it,

206
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,720
like a detective story.

207
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:11,620
That’s very interesting, that’s why I never claimed I studied Homeopathy.

208
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,620
I never studied Homeopathy, I enjoyed reading Homeopathy.

209
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,720
But for me you can’t say I studied but to become a homeopath you have to study.

210
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:28,960
If you don’t enjoy it so much, you have to study, if you enjoy, continue.

211
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,360
When I will show you the remedy that I prescribed and I read it from the books,

212
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:42,360
you will recognize it. You will say, yes this is the remedy, why didn’t I think about it.

213
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,540
You can’t think of it if you’ve never read it.

214
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:58,640
And of course to have steady results in Homeopathy, to have results which are consistent,

215
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,790
you will have to know all the Materia Medica.

216
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:07,370
Otherwise you know how much of the Materia Medica? 10%. 10% will be your results.

217
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,370
You know 20%? 20% will be your results.

218
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:17,130
You know 40%? 40% will be your results. You know 98%? Nobody knows 98.

219
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:25,140
Do not think I know 98. I’m close to 80, 90.

220
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:34,420
Maybe a little bit more than that but nobody can claim that knows all the Materia Medica.

221
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:42,790
But you have to have studied at least once, to go through Boericke, which is 1000 pages.

222
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,390
You can do it in four days, you go through it.

223
00:29:52,390 --> 00:30:00,890
Also what is important is to perceive the case, to understand the case.

224
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:15,770
To perceive the case does not mean in this case he is better from cold, better from warm…

225
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:25,270
Better from cold? Pulsatilla. Everybody knows Pulsatilla. No.

226
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:34,370
Sometimes we have a remedy that in the book says, better from cold and we find it worse from cold.

227
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:45,620
Better from cold here and in the books it says better from warm. Worse from cold.

228
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,850
You will not stop on that detail.

229
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:55,190
That detail is not important. What is important is to fit the whole picture

230
00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:00,870
and in order to fit the picture, you need this perception.

231
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:08,940
I sit there and I tremble, I don’t know the remedy myself. I look and look and I observe.

232
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,020
I perceive everything, what the father says and what the child does.

233
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:29,620
And I search and search in my memory. What is this now? It appears familiar.

234
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:37,520
Retardation, the child has convulsions; what you have not seen yet

235
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:46,880
because the camera is not yet close, you will also the child has also strabismus.

236
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:55,100
Continue with the case.

237
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
-What else?

238
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:30,150
-I gave him Ferrum 6C and he got a reaction from that.

239
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:40,270
He is really continued to come along physically since that point to where he’s physically…

240
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:48,630
-This eruption when it came out?
-Recently. After another remedy.

241
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,130
-Which remedy?

242
00:32:53,980 --> 00:33:05,380
-I gave him, this is the last time I prescribed, I gave him Pulsatilla three times a day

243
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:15,380
for two days and while he was under its influence the convulsions got down.

244
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,990
He was very happy but as soon as I stopped, they came again.

245
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:32,230
After that we took him to another homeopath and she gave Belladonna 200.

246
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:48,730
-He is testing me. Can you see that? The father is testing me, why?

247
00:33:52,930 --> 00:34:01,130
Why I say he is testing me? Because he says, then we gave

248
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:16,860
Belladonna and after there is a pause. What he is testing is to say, who gave Belladonna?

249
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,610
It was wrong or something like that. He wants to see my reaction towards Belladonna.

250
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,860
So I do not answer.

251
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:36,220
I wait to see. He’s testing me, he wants to hear what I have to say about Belladonna.

252
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,200
I want you to observe these things. It is not important at this moment.

253
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:55,200
What is important is that you perceive. You become sensitive and you perceive

254
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:02,700
because the human mind is made in this way that can all the time distort

255
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,230
and present another picture and go through the mind and the mind distorts

256
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,210
and again it presents the way it wants to present things.

257
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:16,950
We are interested in what is instinctive in the health. What is instinctual.

258
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:24,860
Not what intellectual explanation is given about a certain situation.

259
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,860
We are interested about the right thing, what the nature is producing.

260
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:39,800
The nature is producing a violent character. It is producing violence inside.

261
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,880
It is a Nux vomica. It is producing anger.

262
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:54,560
And you will see sitting there a Nux vomica, I think one of the doctors is here

263
00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:07,390
who presented his boss, a surgeon, the head of the hospital.

264
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:14,540
Flabby, fat, you say typical Calc.carbonica.

265
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:22,820
Sitting there, worse cold etc. but it wouldn’t suit Calcarea carbonica, so searching and

266
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:30,880
searching and he had severe headaches that they were bothering him.

267
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:38,620
But I could not see the remedy and then at a certain point I thought,

268
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,230
maybe that is a case of Nux vomica.

269
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:51,130
The anger was not appearing at all, he was a calm man, sitting there, giving answers,

270
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,230
very cool, very calm.

271
00:36:55,410 --> 00:37:06,810
I said to him do you get angry sometimes? Are you irritable? He says, no

272
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:13,910
and then I received a kick because the doctor who was working with him, he kicks me.

273
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:27,310
Because he was his boss, his director and they were in surgery together,

274
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:32,250
so he knew him when he was in surgery, give me this tool!

275
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:40,020
I said, well I don’t mean that you express anger, whether you feel anger inside.

276
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:48,760
He says, yes sometimes. I feel anger but I don’t express it.

277
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:54,890
What we need to perceive is that, not what the person says. No, I’m not irritable.

278
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:06,400
We have to go beyond. That’s why I said here, do you see what he is doing?

279
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,360
You have to see all these things. He is testing me. Why he is testing me?

280
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,060
Because before I passed some judgment on the different remedies.

281
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,860
What about that remedy? What do you say about that remedy?

282
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,710
He wants to know before he gives me the feedback, what happened.

283
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:31,110
It’s very difficult to play games with me because I have so much experience.

284
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,210
I’ve seen thousands and thousands of cases.

285
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:42,040
It’s very difficult to play games. It’s better we tell the truth now.

286
00:38:51,040 --> 00:39:01,660
-After that we took him to another homeopath and she gave Belladonna 200.

287
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:21,560
He wants to play games, you see? But it’s so obvious for me.

288
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,310
For you, you do not take notice in the beginning; you do not know what is happening,

289
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:28,990
you just sit and it goes through.

290
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:35,120
But for me I don’t leave anything unnoticed. Nothing passes unnoticed.

291
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,690
I’m not saying I’m doing this, no. I’m saying you have to do that and I’m showing you

292
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:48,940
in practice what you have to do, how much sensitive you have to become to perceive.

293
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,380
Don’t get ideas in your mind, now he is going to tell me this. This is wrong.

294
00:39:54,830 --> 00:40:00,950
Keep your mind quite open. I said to myself why he stopped?

295
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:08,440
I put a question to myself and then I get the answer immediately, it’s automatic.

296
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:15,440
But if I had ideas, he is going to tell me this, I’ll say do you want to tell me this?

297
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:22,190
He says yes, but this is not an answer. You wait, you wait with a mind

298
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:30,300
which is empty, empty mind. And you look and you see that is the game.

299
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:44,440
-He went into a fever, this was a lot 39C and  lots of twitching and jerking,

300
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:51,780
this was going on for about 24 hours and after that very irritable for a few  days

301
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,580
and then amelioration starts to coming up.

302
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:12,550
After that nothing with the convulsions. Straight after that he had a flue.

303
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:20,190
He doesn’t get a lot of acute things. So these are the two things.

304
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,940
That was just before we left to come over here.

305
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,690
-This remark is very important. You will hear it again and again.

306
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:36,110
He does not get acutes or if they get acutes, they are mild acutes.

307
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:41,860
One day fever, a little bit of fever, not very high, not severe things.

308
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:48,630
Children or grown ups who are deeply disturbed in their mental-emotional

309
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:56,710
level, the nervous system is affected a lot, they will not get severe acutes.

310
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:04,280
The severe acutes come when the organism has been lifted to another level

311
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,030
and then they get acutes.

312
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:12,780
If this child there is a time where he will get a real acute, it’s going to be a pneumonia

313
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,380
and it’s going to be life threatening and you expect for that.

314
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,780
You expect if you prescribe correctly and as the child is raising in health,

315
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,780
then the real acute will come and then its’ going to be very severe and difficult to treat

316
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,280
and you have to be very careful to treat correctly.

317
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:37,130
Because by the time you are treating wrongly this acute, there is a relapse.

318
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,880
You see he makes a remark, just passing, he doesn’t get acutes.

319
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,780
-So these are the two things that come up. That was just before we left to come over here.

320
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:05,530
At the end of that flue he had that cough and the cough became chronic

321
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:17,580
and when we got over here, we took him to a homeopath and he prescribed Syphilinum 1M.

322
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:24,950
-The Belladonna what potency it was?
-200.

323
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,440
-And the Syphilinum 1M.

324
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:37,460
-Yes and he got cold on top of this cough and in two weeks he got very irritable

325
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,040
and the convulsions went away.

326
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,990
-After Syphilinum?
-Yes and he was just having a few twichings.

327
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:59,860
This lasted for about three weeks and we came into France which was very hot

328
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:06,460
and we’ve come back again and it got continuously worse since that time.

329
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,780
-Now the convulsions are becoming worse and worse?

330
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,130
-Yes, that was changing all the time.

331
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:26,590
You see the story that you hear is after several remedies, where are we? Nowhere.

332
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:34,740
Can you tell me if you give the right remedy, what you would expect to happen in this child

333
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,590
to suppose that the remedy has acted in a correct manner?

334
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:47,530
Can you give me an indication what you would expect to have that child to say,

335
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,840
oh it’s improving really?

336
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:57,340
The improvement has started from a deep level, what you would expect?

337
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,130
-To make contact.

338
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,030
-Very good, make contact.

339
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:10,240
The child must reach a point where he makes a contact. The child has no contact.

340
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:17,490
It’s closed up completely. He does not even see, when we put this, he doesn’t look.

341
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,740
The parents say it doesn’t matter how much we make this, no reaction.

342
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:28,660
They don’t know if it sees. The child is deeply disturbed and what is the deepest part?

343
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,240
It’s the mental. Mentally gone completely.

344
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:40,240
If the remedy that we give is acting, it has to act in that level first,

345
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,990
never mind the convulsions.

346
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:47,090
If it acts on this level, the convulsions will be taken care.

347
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:53,190
That is what we want to improve, to see a child that becomes a human being.

348
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,540
This is a zombie now.

349
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:09,590
And we try to make it to a human being. This is the idea. Stop the convulsions?

350
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:16,840
Forget about the convulsions completely, if they stop or they don’t stop.

351
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:22,840
Give me the contact, give me the child back. The child is gone.

352
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:33,590
You have an epileptic who is between us, nobody notices, he is a human being, he’s not a zombie.

353
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:40,630
He has convulsions, all right from time to time he has some convulsions.

354
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:44,580
That’s why they call this disease the divine disease or something like that.

355
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:54,080
Because the epileptic fit is very close to a kind of ecstasy, out of the body experiences

356
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,160
of the yogis, the spiritual people etc.

357
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:02,140
This is not the problem. The convulsion is not the real problem here.

358
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,750
The real problem is that we don’t have a human being.

359
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:09,930
I give a remedy and I say, the cough is finished, therefore my remedy has acted.

360
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:13,650
No, this is not the deeper problem.

361
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,650
So we want to see the deeper problem, we want to prescribe on a deeper level,

362
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:22,150
on the whole picture as we see it, then we have to find the remedy that fits

363
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:31,000
the picture that we described. Retarded, idiotic child, with convulsions, distortions etc.

364
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,330
We go ahead, see some more.

365
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,230
-Now the convulsions are becoming worse and worse?

366
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:53,080
-Yes, all the time and that’s really very…

367
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:59,080
-What can you say about his character?

368
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:13,730
-He doesn’t react to any stimulation, unless it’s physical, unless you actually touch him,

369
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:14,600
or throw him.

370
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:31,100
He doesn’t react to food, but we had X-rays of the brain and they showed totally undeveloped

371
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:39,450
cerebellum which apparently stops him of being able to respond to visual stimulation.

372
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,450
He doesn’t really respond to any visual stimulation…

373
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:54,450
-When you try to put food in his mouth, he will open it?

374
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:03,520
Here we have the actual pathology, we have the anatomical pathology,

375
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:11,410
where the cerebellum is undeveloped. The only thing is he makes some movement.

376
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:17,260
When you touch him, there is some kind of reaction, that’s all.

377
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:23,020
Can we do something with this child homeopathically? I do not know.

378
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:29,020
We’re going to see but at this moment I do not know.

379
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:35,670
I have seen things happening with the homeopathic remedy, which are unbelievable.

380
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:39,520
Is he going to develop his cerebellum, I don’t know.

381
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:47,660
I’ve seen it happening sometimes. Why sometimes and not always? I do not know.

382
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,410
Do we always give the right remedy and the response was… I don’t know.

383
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:58,850
How do I know if I gave the right remedy in all cases? Maybe I did not.

384
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:07,100
Let’s see.

385
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:21,700
-He won’t respond to a toy even if the toy is…  It takes a lot to make him reach out.

386
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:30,300
It’s hard work, you can see… He doesn’t respond to us as his parents.

387
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:42,800
-He is very restless, like that.
- Yes, and after the Syphilinum…

388
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:50,750
What I want is to make a remark here,  that usually the parents of such children

389
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,180
do not want to see and to face the reality.

390
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:06,080
My child is very good. If I ask to describe, it’s a very nice child, always smiling.

391
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:10,430
The child is standing there and they call it a smile.

392
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:17,960
Always smiling, never a problem…

393
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:28,300
I mean this is what you perceive and I say, do they really see what is going on?

394
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:35,160
And unless we really have the picture, we are not able to perceive.

395
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:42,750
From descriptions I have heard about autistic children and almost everything is perfect

396
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:48,350
apart from the fact that he doesn’t talk. What else he does?

397
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:58,130
There is nothing else he does but he does not talk.

398
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:04,120
So these parents have impressed me because they are quite objective.

399
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:10,830
Therefore you may be able to rely on their information if they call you on the telephone

400
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:14,130
and say the child is better.

401
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:18,600
You give a remedy and all the parents, ah it’s getting better.

402
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:25,250
Because they want the child to get better and they tell you on the telephone,

403
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:30,100
it is so much better, to find out later on it is worse.

404
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:39,510
So these parents impressive, they can give quite an objective evaluation.

405
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:46,850
No parent can be absolutely objective but they are quite objective.

406
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,100
Continue.

407
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,080
-He is very restless like that.

408
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:49,580
-Yes and after the Syphilinum it was interesting because […]

409
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,180
he became incredibly nasty and naughty.

410
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:08,380
-Nasty, when I say nasty, nasty for him is just to be so irritable and very restless.

411
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:27,350
-[…] All afternoon he had this irritability, he just kept going through the…[?].

412
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:29,980
-He doesn’t have it anymore.

413
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:40,950
-Red spots came after the Syphilinum and after the convulsions.

414
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:50,450
-[?]

415
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:57,200
-The left eye is looking outwards?
-It didn’t use to, it does now.

416
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:39,600
-He likes to (be cuddled?) very much and he likes darkness and when it was earlier on

417
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:44,180
he would sleep from midnight…

418
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:50,930
This child we can’t be justified thinking about Stramonium because Stramonium

419
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:58,650
has convulsions, etc. but what they said here, which is against Stramonium?

420
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:06,650
-He loves dark.
-He loves dark. Stramonium never.

421
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:14,330
It never loves the dark. It’s one of the few things that we

422
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:26,850
may say never. In Homeopathy you can not say for a symptom in a remedy, always has to be this.

423
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:32,240
Because you will find one case that it will not have that particular symptom.

424
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:38,750
Most of the cases 99% they will have. Stramonium 99% will have fear of dark,

425
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:42,850
aggravation from dark, fear from dark.

426
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:49,860
So the child, if it is Stramonium, it has to show some aggravation in the dark.

427
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:54,710
On the contrary he likes dark.

428
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:04,710
It’s gone. Stramonium is gone for that reason alone, if we don’t have other reasons.

429
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:14,990
-He loves dark, when he was earlier on, he would sleep until midnight and from midnight to

430
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:25,240
the morning he would wake and laugh and play, just playing with himself until the morning

431
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:44,850
and then go back to sleep… He likes fresh…

432
00:57:53,130 --> 00:58:01,840
-He has an aversion to warm food. He likes all vegetables cold…

433
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:37,570
-Are you sure there was no accident? He didn’t fall down before the convulsions?

434
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:48,320
-He fell a couple of weeks before, he fell from the bed but he didn’t cry very much

435
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:50,320
and it didn’t seem to be any damage.

436
00:58:50,420 --> 00:59:01,070
-He fell off the [?] there is no bruising but according to the medical professionals

437
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:05,670
in New  Zealand that was head coming out [?].

438
00:59:09,630 --> 00:59:16,580
There is no brain damage showing up on the scans.

439
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:30,580
-The strabismus formed with the beginning of the convulsions?

440
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:41,580
-I don’t know… two months old  and he had convulsions from six months old.

441
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:55,380
-He had convulsions for four months, when you noticed it, not for six months?

442
00:59:55,650 --> 01:00:04,580
-No, he was two months old when the convulsions started that I noticed that it was going outwards.

443
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:07,830
-How is his thirst?

444
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:15,210
-We don’t give him a lot to drink because it’s the drink that comes out more than the food.

445
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:24,960
-He doesn’t demand that and if we give him water…He obviously doesn’t suffer from thirst.

446
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:27,460
Even in this very hot weather.

447
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:56,360
-The big eruptions after which remedy started? Three months ago started the grand mal,

448
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,000
four months ago?

449
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:09,210
-Just how long we have been here? Two months? Six weeks ago.

450
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:14,200
-Then started the biggest. The last remedy was Syphilinum?

451
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:21,300
-Yes. Before the Syphilinum, after Belladonna.

452
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:26,170
-So the big convulsions, the grand mal, started after Belladonna. Correct?

453
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:30,270
-Yes. And then it begun when it got very hot in India.

454
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:52,500
In India he got in a situation where he was very, very hot and after this they became strong

455
01:01:54,100 --> 01:02:00,100
and that was about two and a half months ago.

456
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:06,190
-That was after Belladonna?
-Yes.

457
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:14,190
-Belladonna was given by a woman homeopath?
-Yes, in New Zealand.

458
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,270
-Now the convulsions will come after sleep?
-Yes.

459
01:02:36,770 --> 01:02:40,020
-So he does have convulsions during sleep?
-Yes.

460
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:47,920
-So he has convulsions either during sleep or when he wakes up, half an hour after?

461
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:53,120
-It’s a little bit difficult to be sure because he has convulsions during the night,

462
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:58,340
so he might be awake until he has that convulsion, so we don’t know if he has been awake,

463
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:04,440
but at times when he’s awake, he goes straight to a convulsion.

464
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:26,720
He has also a peculiar symptom on his convulsions. Did anybody remember what is this?

465
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:34,770
He begins in the head and spreads, except from that, more peculiar.

466
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,670
Tends backwards, more peculiar?

467
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:41,010
Turns to the right, more peculiar?

468
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:13,100
Convulsion are better in cool air.

469
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,850
It’s very violent, yes.

470
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:23,780
The eye goes to the right, no.

471
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:29,020
Maybe he didn’t say it so far.

472
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:31,770
Stretches, no.

473
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,640
Right side, no.

474
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,600
Come along with sleep, no.

475
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:53,300
Terrifying expression, no.

476
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:13,970
When someone touches him, no.

477
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:21,440
The breathing seems to stop, no.

478
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:28,690
That was described I think by his father.

479
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,520
Opisthotonus, no.

480
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:43,970
Fever convulsions, no.

481
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:50,720
The convulsions came out when Belladonna, no.

482
01:05:54,020 --> 01:06:04,510
That shows that the treatment actually on the long run is pushing rather the disease inwards,

483
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:05,850
not outwards.

484
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:12,340
We see the child does not get a contact and his convulsions become worse finally

485
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:16,840
after all these remedies. This is not what I’m asking.

486
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:21,690
I think something which perhaps you didn’t hear well.

487
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:27,470
To tolerate the heat, no.

488
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:36,470
Convulsions after sleep, no.

489
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:44,600
It’s a peculiarity of something the child does during convulsion.

490
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:49,800
Stretches out the extremities, yes.

491
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,850
Turns to right, no.

492
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:07,510
Head backwards, no.

493
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:28,260
Most probably it’s his New Zealand pronunciation that you didn’t follow that sentence.

494
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,090
I think you are tired.
-No.

495
01:07:43,950 --> 01:07:45,400
-You have to have a break.

496
01:07:52,620 --> 01:08:02,120
The respiration is difficult during convulsions, no.

497
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:09,620
Maybe I heard it only, nobody else heard it.

498
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:13,780
Facial distortions, yes.

499
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:19,530
But what he does with his hands? He does something he said.

500
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:31,560
Maybe I’m wrong, I didn’t hear it well.

501
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:39,170
He is saying that the child during convulsion he is pressing his eye.

502
01:08:39,270 --> 01:08:41,610
You didn’t hear it?
-No.

503
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:53,110
-This is very interesting. I thought he said it. Maybe he will repeat it again.

504
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:01,140
We put it back and find out.

505
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:20,110
What is very interesting for me, why the child makes automatic movements?

506
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:26,860
He goes and presses the right eye, the left eye, I can’t remember now.

507
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,440
If you didn’t hear it most probably you will hear it again.

508
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:36,690
During convulsion he will press very hard one point.

509
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:49,340
This becomes a very grand characteristic of the remedy of which we did not have

510
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,030
information in the books.

511
01:09:52,530 --> 01:10:00,430
Therefore if we find the remedy that will act in that child, we know that this is a symptom

512
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:06,530
that may use it, if we see it again in another child or another case.

513
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:14,680
Pressing in the eye during convulsions, he will press and press his eyes very, very strongly.

514
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:18,170
You will hear it again and again, perhaps he will say it.

515
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:29,780
He never said it? All right I give you the point but I made my point.

516
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,940
This is very characteristic, we will not find it in the books but it may be

517
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:45,780
characteristic of the remedy. It’s a little detail. If you find it, then that is the remedy.
