1
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,010
-How are you Uta?

2
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:33,010
-Last May I got Phosphorus 1M and I started the treatment here from last year.

3
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,920
In November 20th I took Calcarea Carbonica 200C.

4
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:49,410
I want to say that I came with two big things that I really want to say them again.

5
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:57,600
I had a lot of fears that many were not simple fears but some were between illusions

6
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:06,780
and visions of my child that is going to die or something and that disappeared completely.

7
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,180
It didn’t appear not in dreams, not in visions, not anymore.

8
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:21,850
I also had presented a symptom of real panic in front of people to talk in public

9
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:28,700
and you can hear me it’s still excited but it’s much better. Much easier.

10
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:38,090
So I took in 20th of November the Calcarea, I didn’t take it before but I took the same day

11
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:45,420
-because I had much irritability and anger at work with my colleagues,

12
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,260
the atmosphere wasn’t easy and I felt much irritability- and I took the Calcarea

13
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,040
and the minute I put it in my mouth I felt much, much better.

14
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:05,290
It was like something that came from life into me.

15
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,530
I took remedies before, I never felt something like this.

16
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,030
It was very …
-Immediate and dramatic.

17
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:19,530
-Immediate, direct energy and this energy I felt through all the winter and lot of energy

18
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,870
I didn’t need to sleep much in the night, not as before, not as now.

19
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:32,870
Now I’m a little down but it was very good energy and much of my stress just disappeared.

20
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:51,990
I had a premenstrual syndrome, I felt much pain and swollen in my breast.

21
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,290
I felt moods and before the period it was very bad.

22
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:05,790
For the first period after Calcarea, it came right away with any symptom before

23
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:14,130
and the menses itself was very good and flowing. That was really relief.

24
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:24,030
Another thing I mentioned is that I did not get any fever for many, many years

25
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:30,120
and 5 weeks after I took Calcarea, I had pneumonia.

26
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:38,370
I didn’t know if it’s pneumonia, I had high fever. Very high fever 40 degrees Celsius.

27
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:52,050
I had much thirst, my mouth was very dry, I felt pain in my right back before I had any cough.

28
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,700
But my general feeling was not bad at all.

29
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:06,370
I was in bed, I was very happy I had acute.
-Finally.

30
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:13,700
-And the energy wasn’t so exhausted. My husband convinced me to take remedy

31
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:22,290
and my friends suggested to take Bryonia because I had pain while moving

32
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:29,860
but I really did not want to take anything and after 4 days it’s gone.

33
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,860
I had more cough for maybe 2 more days.

34
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:41,450
Because of pressure of my brother, he checked me and he said it’s classical pneumonia.

35
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:51,640
He decided I should take antibiotics and of course there wasn’t any argument.

36
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,680
It disappeared after 4-5 days, I went back to work.

37
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,280
-Your husband is medical doctor?
-Not my husband, my brother.

38
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,050
My husband is academic, in the University.

39
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:22,120
Since December I was very much enthusiastic about organizing a conference

40
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,950
because you visited Israel about vaccination.

41
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:32,450
I was very convinced that maybe if I gather some medical doctors and you,

42
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:39,880
we maybe can bring a cooperation.

43
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:48,290
My main thing was to take away the Hepatitis B that is given the first day of the child.

44
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:53,910
I was very busy with this, I had to deal and talk to medical doctors,

45
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,750
to the head of departments in hospital, also in various hospitals.

46
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,340
When you saw me last year I was not in that state of mind to do that

47
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,580
but I had a lot of strength and enthusiasm and it went very good.

48
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:24,580
In my aspect it brought a lot of interest and people wanted to continue, we had more meetings.

49
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:32,170
It was quite astonishing for me to talk to those people without excitement

50
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:40,410
and to be able to organize. So again it was something very good.

51
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,500
-We have to explain actually to the people who listen now that actually

52
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:53,620
what you did you brought the governmental agency of vaccination together with people

53
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,750
who were against vaccination like myself and some others and we had a discussion

54
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:11,250
that was quite productive and we listen to their arguments and they listen to our arguments.

55
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:16,910
It was quite interesting I think the discussion finally.

56
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:22,670
-Very very interesting, it had a lot of echo, slowly, slowly, not immediately

57
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,760
and they are very interested in research now.

58
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:34,000
By their conditions but that’s our negotiation about how we can do maybe research

59
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,250
with baby born in the first year.

60
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:47,840
But I wanted to stress it here because usually I would not be strong enough.

61
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,590
-To undertake such project.

62
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:59,260
-Especially in communicating with these scientific world. I used to be very frightened.

63
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,850
In the winter I was less sensitive to the cold weather.

64
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:15,600
We had snow, we had not a severe winter but I was less sensitive to the cold weather

65
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:21,460
and I worked a lot and I was quite relaxed.

66
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:33,110
From end of March we had a big family event for my daughter.

67
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:43,610
We had her confirmation she is 12 years old and I was involved in that with all my mind and spirit

68
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:57,110
and it was a big thing for the whole day and I had to perform in front of 250 people something like this.

69
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,930
I had felt palpitations in my heart before that. My daughter did it fluently, I had palpitations

70
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:14,770
but I over came it and I could not believe that it went so deep

71
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:23,860
and I could express myself from very deep places and it was high spiritual experience for everybody.

72
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:36,790
It took from me a lot of strength and it was parallel to a crisis.

73
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:51,860
One of my sons said that he is 15 years old and he had a crisis because of face acne.

74
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,940
I treated him this year and he had some skin problems and couldn’t accept it

75
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,940
and he started to fight with me very directly.

76
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,270
He had deep depression and I just gave up and he went to a medical doctor

77
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:19,880
and he took his medication and I became very frustrated and sad.

78
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:27,770
I felt it’s really failure for me, he did not want to go to any homeopath,

79
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:33,370
that’s why I treated him and I felt very, very bad.

80
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:43,860
This is still ongoing with much tension with the (?) and I have 4 children

81
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:53,960
and all together it took from me a lot of strength, energy and I felt much more tired.

82
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,610
When I started to relapse it was beginning of May.

83
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:11,950
It was very interesting. First I felt again a kind of clairvoyance.

84
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:21,530
It was a feeling that I sense things in a way I do not like and I do not want

85
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:28,530
because sometimes it can be connected to bad things.

86
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,140
If I thought of somebody, he would call me the same 5 minutes.

87
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:46,520
It happened and I did not feel secure about this but it was the first thing

88
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:53,370
and then the tiredness and then pains in my breast.

89
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,770
-Before menses?
-More than a week before menses.

90
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:08,860
It was combination when I sat in a taxi and I had air condition on my face and I had these pains,

91
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,210
I thought it’s the menses, then I had very strong flu for 1 week.

92
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:25,700
It was 3 weeks ago with a severe sore throat, with a lot of salvation, very painful, no fever.

93
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:34,960
Then it disappeared and I had a lot of chorasea and general flu and then I got my period.

94
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:48,060
In general my perspiration got much stronger but it also came with hot weather.

95
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:55,310
I mostly perspiring in my lower part of my body, in my genitals and my feet

96
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:03,550
that I didn’t have for long time. Now I perspire very much, even with smell.

97
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,690
-You say that your energy is going down.

98
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:24,200
-Yes, I need to sleep more, usually I need a break when I work from 2-4 o’clock.

99
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:35,050
Every day I take a break, not because I can’t work but it makes it easier to have this break.

100
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:46,940
I have much more fears for my children, much more fears than before but they are not irrational,

101
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,950
I want to stress it.

102
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:01,950
I was a bit frightened because before I came to Greece, I didn’t want so much to travel.

103
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:16,950
And feeling of failure and I don’t think I can take the exam. It’s very strong fear.

104
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,550
Despair, not even to think of taking exam.

105
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:41,700
I also noticed during the time since November I had some opportunity to take hikes

106
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:49,190
to trek in the mountains, that I have quite strong fear of heights.

107
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:59,630
I do climb a lot, I like it but I’m very afraid when it is sloppy and narrow.

108
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,290
The remedy did not affect so much the tendency for constipation.

109
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:19,380
I’m not constipated if I take care of what I eat but this tendency is still there, the same.

110
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:29,650
I have always felt that my bones are not strong and when I train with my son,

111
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:35,410
he is doing martial arts, when he takes me for training, I feel that they are just broken.

112
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,030
I can break my bones easily, it’s a feeling of he can cause me fracture in a second.

113
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:52,030
This feeling did not change. It was always, many years before and still now.

114
00:15:52,130 --> 00:16:04,400
I had very severe loss of hair during the winter and I have now since I’m here back pain.

115
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,780
It can be very strong after sitting, when I get up sometimes I can not move

116
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:20,290
and I’m ameliorated by warm bath, if I put warm application. I did it today and it helped me.

117
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:25,500
For 10 minutes just warm bath, but it’s very strong.

118
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,780
-I want to ask you a few questions. You remember, you said after stool

119
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:42,540
always you’ve been feeling good. It’s still there?

120
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,860
-Maybe it’s less but it is there.

121
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:52,780
-And you say vertigo in high places is still there or less?

122
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:03,780
-Not less. But in the helicopter I was not afraid. It depends what is pointed.

123
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:15,450
It’s more climbing, when it’s very narrow and the path is not wide enough, I can be very scared.

124
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,000
But I can climb on high mountains.

125
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,360
-Perspiration in the foot?
-Very strong.

126
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,440
-And it is clammy?

127
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:36,200
-It is no clammy, it was not in the winter so much. It became lately in May.

128
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:42,280
-What about perspiration during night on sleep?
-I don’t have that.

129
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,640
-But you said to me that you broke out in a skin eruption.

130
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,880
When did you break out in a skin eruption?

131
00:17:49,980 --> 00:18:03,220
-It started in 93 after I got Phosphorus but this year since last May is even more

132
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,570
and getting spread more and more.

133
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:13,130
-Also you had quite a lot of trembling.

134
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:23,560
-I don’t have that. I have more with the heart, palpitations before speaking in public.

135
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:28,030
Specially with microphone, that is impossible.

136
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:37,060
-Also fear that something bad will happen. That fear you said it is there but it is much less.

137
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:42,570
-Yes. It’s not so strong, it is there.

138
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:50,230
-How is your thirst? For cold?

139
00:18:50,330 --> 00:19:02,320
-Quite thirsty, not for cold icy, not at all and I don’t like ice-cream at all but just water or tea.

140
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:11,720
-There is any leucorrhea? It is more now than before?

141
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:20,300
-Yes. It changed, it is not whitish like it used to be.

142
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,410
It’s more yellowish but it’s there and it’s not more.

143
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:38,810
-Also you have related when you see something like an accident or things

144
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:45,890
which are wounded people, you were affected very much.

145
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:55,140
-It is very strong. Not accidents, mostly violence.

146
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:04,890
Especially now we have a lot of stress in Israel and…

147
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,380
-You feel it?
-I feel it.

148
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:17,510
-The aversion to milk is still there or you started drinking milk?

149
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:24,490
-I can drink milk only in warm, a little bit, I don’t like it.

150
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,890
-The finger nails?
-Very brittle.

151
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,160
-Was anytime after Calcarea carbonica that became strong?

152
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,740
-Maybe a bit they became stronger.

153
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:10,830
-Why do you think you have this relapse? There is a relapse which starts. Why?

154
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:19,810
Because of this conflict with your son? What mostly took away the energy?

155
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:30,060
With your son concerning his treatment. You over exerted yourself?

156
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:37,260
-I think I mentioned last time that I can not be under too much exertion.

157
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,760
Usually this experience I had in April was very special

158
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:50,980
and it was a bit of ‘catharsis’ for me that I could…

159
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:59,390
It was the most important female experience I experienced.

160
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:06,640
It was very high and it was like ‘catharsis’ but then afterwards I felt exhausted and drained.

161
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,980
But parallallely I had this problem with my son.

162
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:19,140
It’s not so much only the conflict as a teenager or whatever he has but it was a lot of fear.

163
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:25,740
He was deeply depressed and we were very worried for him.

164
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,200
This morning when I was talking about this, I cried a lot.

165
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:40,950
Now I’m much more calm but it was very stressful and it’s still ongoing.

166
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:46,310
He is not well balanced by the remedies he was given.

167
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:55,040
-But he was given homeopathic remedies or finally he took allopathic?

168
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:03,210
-He was under a homeopathic treatment all the time and he finally decided to make his decisions

169
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:06,960
because he couldn’t face the external things that came.

170
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:15,960
-Yes but did he take allopathic antibiotics or medication?

171
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,710
-He is taking antibiotics now for 1 month.

172
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:26,500
That’s his decision, that’s his treatment now, we can not interfere with this.

173
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:33,950
We can not say anything. He decided to do that and he said this is my exciting cause

174
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,640
and I treat my exciting cause.
-I see.

175
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:45,130
But you told him that most probably he is going to feel bad psychologically later on?

176
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:50,630
You have to explain to him and if he feels bad psychologically, maybe he will learn.

177
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,700
-Did you ever have experience with teenagers?

178
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,460
He said, I’d rather have cancer than having acne on my face.

179
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,140
-It’s very strange.

180
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:11,130
-And he is so bright and sensitive and highly intelligent and he wants to study medicine

181
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:17,230
and I could not handle it.

182
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:32,630
-But most probably if he takes the right remedy, he is going to break out into tremendous (?)

183
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:37,730
maybe after the correct remedy, he will become even worse.

184
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,810
You did not expect with the right remedy, first to disappear the acne.

185
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:48,650
First you will be worse and then he will go better.

186
00:24:48,750 --> 00:25:00,660
-He had no patience and he is impatient in general, so I took it very…

187
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,340
-OK thank you.

188
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:37,220
One time antibiotics, few doses of this or that can still the organism bring back order by itself.

189
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:52,120
Another thing that can cause a relapse is a sudden grief that comes unexpectedly

190
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:59,030
and it can produce a sudden grief, it can produce a new state of conditions

191
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:05,630
that the patient may feel very bad.

192
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:17,720
Another condition is of physical over exertion.

193
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:27,370
In this particular case, in which you have given Calcarea carbonica which acted

194
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:35,110
and you know that Calc. carbonica is sensitive to over exertion,

195
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:47,890
you see headache with over exertion, all kinds of problems from over exertion.

196
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:06,870
You see over exertion aggravation, Calcarea is the main remedy actually for over exertion.

197
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:14,690
Therefore if you don’t have a full relapse, it’s better to wait.

198
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:21,530
She is going to go down and down and down, to full relapse,

199
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,280
then you give it a beautiful reaction.

200
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:31,780
But if you give it in the middle when this is happening you may have a problem

201
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,470
and if you are not experienced enough, you’ll mess up the case.

202
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:51,720
-What would the problem be, if you do give the same remedy?

203
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,470
-I have to be a prophet to tell you.
-We are all prophet from your wisdom.

204
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:12,870
-I’m not a prophet. I can not predict. What I know is that you may start having new symptoms

205
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,880
which they don’t even belong to the remedy.

206
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,370
She will lose more energy, she will become worse from this and that.

207
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:30,990
The organism tries to rearrange itself and in this process,

208
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:38,450
she may produce symptoms of Arsenicum. Then you give Arsenicum.

209
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:44,490
The Arsenicum produces symptoms of Bryonia. Give Bryonia

210
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,630
and in 6 months you will find the case confused.

211
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:55,230
Not from one dose of repetition but if you are unexperienced and you keep on giving remedies

212
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:01,650
because of this and that reason, then you will produce a case of confusion.

213
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:14,700
-Yesterday I was more relaxed, I was too tired after the day and I think I did not think,

214
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:19,450
only when you asked me I thought afterwards what really caused this relapse.

215
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:25,700
But because I get in my clinic many pictures like this, people come

216
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:35,370
and I would prescribe again really the Calcarea now because my relapse is on emotional level.

217
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:45,530
I feel that the main thing in my life is my motherhood and I feel there a lot of pain;

218
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:54,740
I wouldn’t wait as a homeopath if somebody come to me.

219
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,070
-I understand that. I will speak a little bit more about your case.

220
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:06,330
-I had the same question with (?) because of my clinical experience

221
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:12,070
but with her I would maybe repeat Causticum. If somebody comes with such pain

222
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:21,400
but OK you said no but myself I feel that my relapse has physical expressions

223
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,900
but the background is very deep emotional and it is ongoing.

224
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,080
Yesterday night I had a night mare, a very bad dream.

225
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:40,330
-About your son I understand but it is better to have one nightmare

226
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:45,790
than have 10 nightmares together, you and me.

227
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,110
-George I have another question about this rule.

228
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:01,940
You say if there is a relapse because of exertion, chemical drugs or (?) drugs etc.

229
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:08,120
if there is a relapse, how long a period of time would be appropriate given that relapse,

230
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,990
maybe for the patient severe?

231
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:19,690
And very uncomfortable and maybe partial or complete, what period of time can you determine

232
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:27,700
that the vital force will not be coming back and that you need to readminister the remedy.

233
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:38,940
-You have to establish whether the case is going down, down

234
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:46,130
or whether the case is on a statement, that means is on a certain level.

235
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:51,030
As long as this level stays there, hands off.

236
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:57,030
If the case goes down, down there is a time where she will show a full relapse

237
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:03,870
and then you give it. But as long as you don’t see that, it’s better not.

238
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,120
For her case if we are homeopaths, we give placebo.

239
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,330
This is a case where you have to give placebo.

240
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:18,780
What happens with Hava there are two things which affected her, as I understand.

241
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,780
One most probably was over exertion but the second thing

242
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,460
which affected her was the health of her son.

243
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:39,710
Because after all still has some sensitivity in this area.

244
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,730
It’s not totally gone, she is not an indifferent mother, she can not be.

245
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:53,650
Her character is to care about her family, her children, her sons etc.

246
00:32:53,750 --> 00:33:00,730
So there is a sensitivity area and in this area, she has been hit and there is a conflict.

247
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:07,320
This conflict will take away quite a lot of the energy and this conflict stays.

248
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:15,820
A conflict is an emotional thing and she feels it in her feelings. She is not happy

249
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:22,240
at all with the condition because she thinks that her son is going down the gutter

250
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:32,330
by taking antibiotics for his acne and this is a real problem.

251
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:42,970
You can not fight with real problems.

252
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:57,640
If you try to correct real problems of life, I don’t have money and I’m anxious to find money.

253
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,810
You give a remedy, he will find money? No.

254
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:07,800
As soon as he has a job, the anxiety is going.

255
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:15,590
As soon as she will see that her son is not in danger really, that his organism

256
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:24,440
is overcoming it, that her son is OK, she will overcome it, back the organism will come.

257
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:33,490
Now you try to give a remedy at this point to make what? You don’t know.

258
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:43,730
She maybe in a relapse but as you all agree, we don’t see a full relapse in her case.

259
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:54,840
You all agreed about that. Therefore in such a case this is a kind of a rule

260
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,590
that you have to have in mind and you have to observe this rule.

261
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:06,100
You have a good remedy to a case, keep it as long as you can.

262
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:13,740
Otherwise you will have problems. I can give a certificate for that.

263
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:30,480
Now she knows the remedy, she is a homeopath. After all if she becomes really despair

264
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:38,160
she can always take and she can always call me and I will say, now you can take the remedy.

265
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:46,410
-What about the fear of the exams?

266
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:58,660
-This is a totality. If I have to find a remedy, I have to give it to everyone.

267
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:09,240
I can assure you everyone is feeling the same way, fear of exams.

268
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,990
Don’t take, unless you tremble, you go like this.

269
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:25,910
If I see you going like this, I will give you Gelsemium but I have to see that.

270
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:35,560
It’s really necessary and I don’t see that, knowing your character

271
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:39,570
and in the beginning how you acted.

272
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:48,650
-Would it be a possibility if you have given a remedy that really acted well

273
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:53,560
and you have a partial relapse by (?) treatment or anything else similar,

274
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:59,310
would it be possible then to give the same remedy in a low potency like 6X

275
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:04,660
so to push it a little bit so that it comes up again?

276
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:09,470
-You can give even the same potency or lower potency.

277
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:14,470
What I say is the remedy will act only if there is full relapse;

278
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:18,570
unless it is full relapse, it will not act.

279
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:26,640
Low or higher potency. If it is a full relapse, the remedy will act.

280
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:36,830
But this the idea not to lose the thread of the right prescription.

281
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:49,330
You got this thread of the right prescription. If you lose it, then it is very sad story.

282
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:56,480
Because you had a great possibility to relieve the patient and you lost it.

283
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,730
These are the rules, that’s what I’m saying, be careful.

284
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:08,680
I’m just giving you my experience. You don’t want to learn nonsense of fantasies.

285
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:15,740
You want to learn my experience, 40 years I have made these mistakes again and again.

286
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,330
That’s why I say you don’t want to make the mistake again.

287
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:34,390
-(?) you said, each remedy with almost clear picture might give a boost to the organism

288
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:41,810
because it is already fighting. The remedy is there and (?) are never clear in these groups.

289
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:49,680
Is it justified to prescribe an almost clear picture which might give a boost to the organism?

290
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:57,680
-Yes. I think I did not make myself clear.

291
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:04,140
What I said is, if the remedy has acted as beautiful as that one,

292
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,930
which presupposes that this case isn’t as complicated as Eliza’s case.

293
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:14,060
Eliza’s case is on another level all together.

294
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,140
Now we’re talking about that level of her condition.

295
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:29,400
I said, when somebody is on this level, which is a good level,

296
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:40,150
where the remedy has acted so well, in a partial relapse you are not supposed to give the remedy.

297
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:47,500
But in Eliza’s case we’re battling with a very complicated situation.

298
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:53,420
If we get a little bit of a clear picture, we’re justified to give it

299
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,740
because the picture was never clear.

300
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:03,930
It was this remedy, that remedy, that remedy. Then we had to chose the best possible remedy.

301
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,840
The same with the case of Lachesis that we have seen.

302
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:18,090
We battle in between the lines. You remember how difficult it is to chose the remedies

303
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:27,430
but finally by choosing correct remedies, you come to positive result.

304
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,870
For instance, she may have been taken before, Lachesis, the same remedies

305
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:40,260
that we gave apart from the first, she may have been taken.

306
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:50,110
But after the first remedy which is correct and the second remedy which is correct,

307
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:53,470
then it goes on and improves.

308
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:59,480
But give all these remedies upside down will have no effect.

309
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,330
They will leave the patient untouched.

310
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:15,610
So the main thing is to find in such cases and you don’t have clear picture.

311
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:21,360
The last time with Lachesis became like the breathing,

312
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:25,110
most probably here we’ll have a clear picture.

313
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:31,780
Now she comes, she says again, I have a relapse and I say, no.

314
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,780
Here we have reached the point where it was a very good action.

315
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:47,770
Maybe you don’t realize the whole class, how much better she is.

316
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:51,350
Those especially who have not seen the original case,

317
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:57,610
you have no idea how much better she is but in my understanding what I know about her

318
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,690
and how much suffering on an emotional level…

319
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:06,240
When she came, she didn’t come because the head was moving.

320
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,330
She came because the depression was so big and she suffered tremendously.

321
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:18,330
So if I see the progress, beautiful.

322
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,240
-If I could, I would like to share my experience concerning dental work.

323
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:29,420
I’ve been speaking with dentists about this, that partially the relapse after dentist work

324
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,500
it might be due to the fact that people take pain killers

325
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:42,850
that contain hormones of the adrenaline area.

326
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,840
-Are you dentist?

327
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:59,910
-No, I discussed this matter with the dentists because I had a lot of allergic patients

328
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:05,990
who had relapses and the same experience I made after other hormones.

329
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:09,750
-It depends with what the dentist is doing.

330
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:17,330
For instance if he is trying to kill the nerve for this they use very severe drugs,

331
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:20,920
like formaldehyde or something like that.

332
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:30,790
This is the worse. Also when you have an extraction and they get anesthetics, also it is.

333
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:46,370
But even what they used to use, the oil of (?) even that I found out

334
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,640
that could bring a relapse.

335
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:57,880
So it was the pain, the anesthetic injections, the killing of the roots

336
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:08,310
and it was also the adrenaline or whatever they were using for killing the pain.

337
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:14,730
-Another good sign that we found in this patient was that she had a severe acute

338
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:18,900
which overcame without taking antibiotics.

339
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:25,050
-Did you hear that? This was very good.

340
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:29,790
In case you don’t understand the theory, what are you going to do?

341
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:35,540
You are going to give one remedy after another, give antibiotics, give this, give that.

342
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:45,820
You see how useful it is to understand the theory. You can save yourself a lot of trouble.

343
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:53,380
Also it’s beautiful to see what we teach here are not just theoretical aspects.

344
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:58,310
They are facts of life and death.

345
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:08,540
-Concerning this level I’d like to know if there any cases of somebody dying in the family

346
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,550
and then suddenly occurs complete weakness and a big grief in the patient,

347
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:20,980
are we then allowed to take the remedy that would be suitable for this case or shall we wait?

348
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:29,580
-If there is a severe grief which causes unbearable pain,

349
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:38,590
then you have to judge whether this new situation is a situation of Natrum muriaticum

350
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:44,330
or Ignatia or Phosphoric acid or Aurum or Staphysagria, whatever.

351
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:56,410
You have to judge at this moment and not take the constitutional remedy automatically.

352
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:06,050
But if, because of the grief, you have all the symptoms back of the chronic condition

353
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:12,140
plus depression, yes you take the same remedy.

354
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:20,960
But if now you have a new symptomatology without having back the chronic symptoms

355
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:23,230
you take the new remedy.

356
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:35,130
-In the case there is a relapse that’s only physical and it’s not full relapse

357
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:38,880
and you’d prefer to give allopathic medicine,

358
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:48,070
is it possible also to give mother tincture’s that ease pain?

359
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,730
Like (?) for instance.
-I don’t know this.

360
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:57,730
-It is in Spain.

361
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:03,470
-What I say is not to take regular 3 times the day a pain killer,

362
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:06,540
within a week you will cause a relapse.

363
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:12,080
If for one day you really have severe pain, you can take a pain killer,

364
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:24,130
you can take aspirin, 2 aspirins. I have found out that out of all the allopathic drugs,

365
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:30,650
aspirin is the least dangerous to cause problem.

366
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,060
-Me too I made the observation, when a patient is on the upper level

367
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,130
and he got some disturbances from outside and you have new symptoms,

368
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:47,970
that if you wait the organism has the strength to clear the picture again.

369
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:55,210
If you go down to the lower levels and there is a stress factor from outside,

370
00:47:55,310 --> 00:48:06,380
then the picture might change to different remedies or you have to repeat the remedy?

371
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:15,130
-Correct. It is different. The rules for the lower level patients are different.

372
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:25,210
This case why we establish it and we say this case belongs to the uppermost layers?

373
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:31,220
Because of the clear picture and clear reactions she had and amelioration.

374
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:37,300
That’s why we establish this case, we say this case belongs to the uppermost levels.

375
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:45,650
Now we have to keep it there, not to bring her down again.

376
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:59,890
-When you said (?) when is a state of good reaction to remedy suddenly an acute pain

377
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:11,130
or one acute symptom which is coming back, we are going to look for some (?) the symptom

378
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:15,070
or even treated with aspirin or something.

379
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:20,880
In contrast to if there are all symptoms coming back,

380
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:29,630
are you referring into what Hahnemann says psoric and not psoric remedies?

381
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:38,630
Because he said a non psoric you can use when you have that slight acute situation

382
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:45,730
or if things are (?) then you go to the psoric remedies?

383
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:54,630
-No, I don’t refer to that. There is no connection between what Hahnemann was saying.

384
00:49:54,730 --> 00:50:04,300
Hahnemann had an understanding which I may say it was a partial understanding

385
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,550
of diseases of what we have today.

386
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:16,300
Today we have more complicated diseases and also the theory of the miasm as Hahnemann put it,

387
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:27,300
I don’t agree. I don’t agree that all diseases are due to syphilis psora and gonorrhea, no.

388
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:38,060
Therefore in this matter, when he says psoric remedies I don’t believe there are such remedies,

389
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,650
we can call psoric remedies.

390
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:51,060
Yes there are some remedies where more indicated in skin eruptions, like Sulphur,

391
00:50:51,160 --> 00:51:01,810
like (?), like Petroleum but to call these remedies, put them on this category of psora

392
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:09,550
you will exclude them from gonorrhea cases where the same remedies will be indicated.

393
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:16,400
So therefore I don’t agree with the separation of the remedies in psoric and no psoric.
