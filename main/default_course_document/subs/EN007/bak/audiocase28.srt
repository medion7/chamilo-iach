1
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:33,360
-I’d like to thank Mr. [name] for his kindness to invite me in this,

2
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:44,680
I would say, quite successful congress from the people I can see.

3
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:58,680
And I would like to wish that Homeopathy is really understood in its deeper meaning and

4
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:12,330
sense and potential that it has and that it will be growing with the time and also that at

5
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:20,390
certain level governments, not only the Swedish government but all governments will

6
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:32,420
understand the real good that Homeopathy can deliver to the people and then maybe not

7
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:45,220
only protect Homeopathy but also try to help in order to spread.

8
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:59,820
Before I go on with the lecture, which is quite theoretical and maybe boring, I would like

9
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,160
to give you some live examples of the action of the homeopathic remedy upon some

10
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:12,060
serious cases that we have been dealing with. So I can show with examples where

11
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:23,310
Homeopathy can be effective and where sometimes it can be aggravating the situation

12
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:32,300
and also the necessity for great care, great attention on the part of the homeopath,

13
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:44,820
when he is dealing with cases that are really serious and close to death.

14
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:54,220
The first case I would like to give you and for those who know Homeopathy they will try to

15
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:01,720
follow my way of reasoning, why we prescribe that remedy or the other remedy and I must

16
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:08,930
say from the beginning that the way that we treat is by giving one remedy at the time,

17
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:20,840
based upon the total symptomatology of the patient and observing the results that they

18
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,570
come after the prescription of that remedy.

19
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:30,310
So that we may in continuation decide whether we should prescribe a complementary

20
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:36,060
remedy, another remedy, a remedy that follows well, a higher potency, a repetition of the

21
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,300
same potency etc.

22
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:51,720
This is a case of a man, a civil engineer, 72 years old and the case is from the14th of

23
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,470
September of 1979.

24
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:09,720
This man was operated in America, in Houston in Spring Memorial Hospital, for an aorta

25
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:20,550
transplant. The operation was successful but the patient developed very high fever that

26
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:34,590
was not amenable, was not showing any tendency to go down in spite of many

27
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:43,050
antibiotics, high doses of penicillin that have been given with the result that after two

28
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:52,170
months of continuous fever after the operation, the cardiologist who had operated him in

29
00:04:52,270 --> 00:05:00,220
Houston accompanied him in Greece and put him in a hospital in Greece.

30
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,720
The patient stayed in one of the best hospitals of Athens for another month under the

31
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,830
same condition without showing any amelioration.

32
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:27,270
Eventually he went into a coma state and the doctors in attendance called the relatives of

33
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:35,560
the patient and asked them whether they should open the left leg, the veins,

34
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,400
in order to feed this patient, in order to give saline because both hands and

35
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,390
the right leg were swollen up from trying to find the veins of this man and

36
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,610
it was impossible anymore to feed, to give

37
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,140
the saline through the intravenous.

38
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:07,540
The doctors told the relatives that they did not think they should continue with the case,

39
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,970
they thought it was a matter of a few days, the patient would die within 2-3 days and they

40
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:22,310
were asking whether the relatives wanted to continue the treatment.

41
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:29,440
At this stage because the daughter of this man was known to me and a friend, she came

42
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:35,940
and ask whether Homeopathy could do something for her father.

43
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,780
I said, this is a very good case for Homeopathy.

44
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:52,610
The man was on the hospital and I did not want to go through the back door in the hospital

45
00:06:52,710 --> 00:07:03,910
and treat the case, so I asked the relatives to ask the doctors in attendance whether they

46
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:11,500
would agree that I would go there to treat the patient homeopathically, in which case they

47
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:20,420
had to withdraw all their medicines.

48
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:31,170
The doctors as you may understand were very happy that the patient will die under

49
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,500
Homeopathy.

50
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:48,750
After withdrawing the medicines that they were giving, they had reached the point where

51
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:58,620
they were giving amphotericin B. This is a very virulent medicine that is given for fungus

52
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:08,420
infections and it is a very strong medicine that has a lot of side effects.

53
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,920
Anyhow the medicine was withdrawn and the condition of the patient was, as I told you,

54
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:27,560
he was in a comatose state with his kidneys functioning barely, urea was very high, the

55
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:37,400
clearance of the urine was 9, which indicates a great diminution of the functioning of the

56
00:08:37,500 --> 00:09:02,530
kidneys, the blood pressure was high, the fever was under medicine from 37.8 to 38.2

57
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:12,980
and once the remedy was withdrawn fever shoot up to 39.5.

58
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:27,640
When I saw the patient, he was lying, breathing deeply and a very red, with reddish face,

59
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:36,310
completely immovable, he didn’t seem to suffer in spite of the fact that he was swollen in

60
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:45,060
his both upper extremities and the leg. He had already developed some bad source from

61
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:59,910
lying for so long time, he was in a quite deep coma, not in very deep and there was a slight

62
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:15,060
perspiration, oily face and the appearance of the coma indicated a remedy that is good for

63
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,980
such conditions. What is the remedy then?

64
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,140
-Opium.

65
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:37,470
-Opium very good. Opium 200 was given and that was in the morning. In the evening

66
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:48,980
they were some signs, a little bit motion and also some kind of words, they were not words

67
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,560
yet but some kind of moaning coming out.

68
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:03,140
By next morning the coma was reduced, still the patient was not in a condition to

69
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:11,230
communicate but if the daughter would speak to him, he would have some kind of reaction.

70
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:22,230
The fever remained still high but there was some signs definitely that the remedy had

71
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:30,560
started working.

72
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:40,140
What is interesting is that in that first night he was restless, much more restless now,

73
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:52,390
passed a stool, fever in the night 39.6 in the morning 38.8 pulse 124.

74
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:58,140
Anyhow I will make it more quick.

75
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,390
After 2 days the man had come somewhat out of coma, that means he was able to

76
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:13,400
communicate, his fever started coming down but as the state was remaining more or less

77
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:22,640
stable, that means it was no progressing, I retook the case with the help of his wife and his

78
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,600
daughter.

79
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:36,390
What I did, I asked from them all the information that was available about him before he

80
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,970
went for operation, that means what type of person he was. He was a warm blooded or a

81
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,560
cold blooded case? It was a person who was suffering with headaches, he was suffering

82
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,090
with constipation, he had some diarrheas, stomach problems?

83
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:57,060
All the details that were possible to elicit from his wife and his daughter.

84
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:05,810
The idea was in this case to give a remedy that we call, if it is possible to find, the

85
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:17,390
constitutional remedy, a remedy that will go deeper and will stimulate the defenses further.

86
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:24,220
According to the information that was given, this man was a hot blooded man, was having

87
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,260
different other problems with his heart, with palpitations, before the operation, he was

88
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:41,980
easily tired but the details of his case pointed out to Sulphur.

89
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:56,720
So Sulphur 200 was given and the recovery started speeding up.

90
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:04,390
He went another 2-3 nights where he was coming out of coma but still in a very confusive

91
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:21,210
state of mind. The fifth day while the fever was almost practically down, gone, the night

92
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:28,710
nurse related to me that the whole night the patient was very restless and he was

93
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,500
constantly talking.

94
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:53,210
Talking in a delirium and talking about words that did not fit a man, a civil engineer of 72

95
00:14:53,310 --> 00:15:06,810
years old. He was a very conservative man and to talk about sexual matters and talking

96
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:14,960
about some prostitutes, saying words which are obscene.

97
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:21,760
This delirium was going on. The morning of the fifth day I went to see the case with the

98
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:28,620
delirium going on all the night constantly. When I saw him he was in that delirium state,

99
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,420
restless, talking, talking and talking in this language as I told you.

100
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:48,330
Because he was still quite red, the blood pressure was quite high, the loquacity brought

101
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:58,080
to my mind the remedy which will we call Lachesis.

102
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:12,500
So Lachesis 200 was given in the case and there was the mistake.

103
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:22,910
I gave Lachesis, the evening of the fifth night and next day the sixth day I go to the

104
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:33,010
hospital to see him, he is in a worse state than before. The blood pressure has shoot up to

105
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:49,510
200, his speech now is slammering, it’s still delirium but the words are not heard and the

106
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:56,420
man seems to go back.

107
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:09,160
And as I’m going to talk to you about harmonious and inharmonious remedies.

108
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,170
For me there are no harmonious and inharmonious, there are correct and non-correct

109
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,590
remedies.

110
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:22,090
The correct remedy will act harmoniously, even if initially brings about a kind of

111
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:32,930
aggravation. The incorrect remedy may act inharmoniously, may produce a disturbance

112
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:42,420
or a kind of bad reaction, especially the high potency and more especially if we are dealing

113
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:49,920
with cases that are in a state of sensitivity and when I say sensitivity I mean patients that

114
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:58,670
are in a state of great precariousness, they are ready, maybe to die.

115
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:06,750
In such conditions, we can not afford to make mistakes because we shall have the result

116
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:15,090
that I was having. In this case he was beautifully, the man was coming out of coma, the

117
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:26,840
fever was dropping, there was a possibility that he may be resurrected from death and

118
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,830
there on the third remedy, I made the mistake and I gave the wrong remedy.

119
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:38,950
The wrong remedy produced immediately a reaction in this case, why?

120
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:49,430
Because it was incorrect but close to the case. That means the remedy was quite close,

121
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:55,760
it was fitting the case, not absolutely but quite a lot. Therefore it disturbed, it acted

122
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:05,170
inharmoniously and not curatively.

123
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:12,820
When you have a case like that, then you have to sit there and think and think and think,

124
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:19,320
now what are you going to do? The only thing that we can give in such cases is neither

125
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:27,520
give an antidote or anything like that but finding what is the correct remedy which is

126
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,480
indicated at the moment.

127
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,780
Lachesis was wrong, what was the correct remedy?

128
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:40,770
If I could find that, I may be able to save this patient.

129
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:51,380
Apart from the delirium was continuing, as I said, but also I noticed that the hands of the

130
00:19:51,480 --> 00:20:03,630
patient were mostly on his genitalia. So with this loquacity, with this obscene talking, with

131
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:11,070
the hands constantly on the genitalia which was confirmed by the nurse that was in

132
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:21,490
attendance, the correct remedy was not Lachesis but it was Hyoscyamus.

133
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:30,250
The symptomatology is so much in favor of Hyoscyamus that then the redness of the

134
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:41,490
face can be disregarded. Neither it’s always that Hyoscyamus has a pale face.

135
00:20:41,590 --> 00:21:00,740
Hyoscyamus again 200 was prescribed and soon the patient came out of delirium and

136
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:08,750
I would just relate this case up to here, I will tell you in few words what happened later,

137
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:19,830
just to show how the wrong remedy acted in an inharmonious way.

138
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:26,490
The patient on the 12th day asked to be taken away from the hospital because in the

139
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:34,990
hospital there was nothing to be done because all the doctors of the hospital had left the

140
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:43,570
case to me and the only thing that was done with the case he was fed through the nose,

141
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:54,410
with a tube, he was fed with some crust food, that’s all the hospital was providing.

142
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,910
Therefore was no real reason for the patient staying in the hospital.

143
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:05,490
The 12th day he asked to go away from the hospital and continue the treatment in his

144
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:19,200
house. We continued the treatment and after a month of initial treatment where the patient

145
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:26,710
was doing really well, he had during this period of time another 3 remedies, one of which

146
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:30,960
was Apis.

147
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:44,520
After Apis he was given Natrum muriaticum and then Calcarea carbonica.

148
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:53,040
These are the remedies he had during this month of recovery.

149
00:22:53,140 --> 00:23:00,020
They were 3 doctors in attendance of this case, one was a cardiologist, one a nephrologist

150
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:08,270
and a general practitioner. I asked the patient to call the cardiologist that was attending the

151
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:15,100
case in the hospital because I wanted his advice as his ankles were still somewhat

152
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,300
swollen.

153
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:26,400
The cardiologist went to the house, rang the bell, somebody opened the door and he said I

154
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,130
would like to see Mr Stathopoulos, Stathopoulos is the name of the patient.

155
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:38,870
He says I am Mr Stathopoulos. The cardiologist said, not you, the patient.

156
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:47,960
He says I am the patient. He could not recognize his patient that had one month ago in a

157
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:53,950
coma, in a state of vegetable, he could not recognize him one month later, he could not

158
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,200
believe him.

159
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:09,700
This is interesting to see the effect of homeopathic remedies and what can bring about as

160
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:16,450
people believe that Homeopathy is good for little things, if you have a little headaches, if

161
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:24,950
you have a little of cold, pains here and there, then Homeopathy is good.

162
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:35,950
No, Homeopathy is a very potentially strong and correct treatment that if it is applied

163
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:44,240
properly can save a lot of the cases that are going on untreated today and they are going

164
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,990
on suffering year after year.

165
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:57,700
He is now 78 years old, still going strong, last year actually he travelled to Canada.

166
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:04,450
His son is there in the University and he is actually in a very good condition, I have been

167
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:11,500
attending him for a few times during these years, he did not need very much support.
