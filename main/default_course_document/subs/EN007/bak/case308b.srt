1
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:42,810
Uta, I want to ask her why she is so emotional, she is crying so much?

2
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:48,740
-First of all I’m very ashamed that I was crying so much when I was here the last time

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:58,480
and left such a bad impression. I’m not always like that.

4
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:08,980
Second, I always come in such state if I come in touch with certain traumas in my life.

5
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,720
But I would like to start telling you how I felt after receiving Causticum because in the

6
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,310
meantime I can stop this trembling a bit.

7
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:23,550
I received Causticum on May 18th and I took it in the evening.

8
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:32,300
In the night afterwards I had a dream which I already told. It was a dream in which I cleared

9
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:45,560
 things with people from my past, who injured me physically and emotionally.

10
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:52,720
I also dreamt the following nights very often and very frequently I was dealing with

11
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,430
these issues.

12
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,380
During the day I often had strong stomach pains like stones were in there.

13
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:07,550
You know this fairytale with the wolf and the 7 goats, when the wolf eats stones?

14
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,750
Like that.

15
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:16,720
I had dizziness or vertigo sometimes and I was in a bad mood which I don’t have

16
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,470
very often.

17
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:26,480
On my trip back home I was extremely nauseous, it was so bad that I would never have

18
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:34,980
been able to manage this trip alone. I was very dizzy in my head and my male friend and

19
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,220
my dear female friend who was also here in this course, they really pulled me through

20
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,480
this whole trip.

21
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,730
Then in the airplane I noticed that the strangers who they were travelling with me and

22
00:02:50,830 --> 00:03:04,980
whom I saw in the lounge and then on the plane, that I didn’t like them all, not anyone of them.

23
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:14,140
I had extreme sense of smell, I was very sensitive to odors, I noticed many kinds of body

24
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:21,710
odors, also of perfumes and food smell and it was so disgusting that I could hardly

25
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,210
breathe.

26
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,740
-She is describing now the way back home, right?

27
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,730
-Yes those are the main points concerning the trip home.

28
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:42,070
At home I felt well again. In my own house I feel well. For me it’s like my third skin.

29
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:48,610
One week after returning home, I got a cold with pains in my throat and coryza.

30
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:57,120
I never have fever, also not this time but I was perspiring strong.

31
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:05,320
The secretion I had from my nose was watery and very acrid. It wounded everything

32
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:12,540
around my nose. This acrid discharge kept on for weeks, even after the cold and the

33
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:20,630
actual coryza had gone. Then the throat pains went away.

34
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:33,160
I often had dreams of former situations from my childhood, just let me say the facts first.

35
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:41,340
About 5 weeks after Causticum the pains begun. First on my right arm and the pains feel

36
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:49,540
as if the arm was broken or if as I would have been beaten very severely.

37
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:57,250
All the weeks afterwards the pains were very strong but they were wandering.

38
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,200
-To different places?

39
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:08,760
-First on my right side, wrist, arm, shoulder joint but alternating, not at the same time.

40
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,270
The pains are worse at night, I often can’t fall asleep due to the pains.

41
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,280
-The pains still continue?

42
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:26,520
-Yes and when I do fall asleep I wake again often between 3-4 o’clock in the morning

43
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:34,770
also due to the pains. Some nights I can not go back to sleep then and then I have to get

44
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:41,110
up and do something which makes the pains more tolerable.

45
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,130
Now that I have to close one more button on my shirt I feel so warm, heat is also a big

46
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,330
problem.

47
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:59,490
About 6- 7 weeks after taking Causticum I developed cracks on the corner of my mouth

48
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,280
first on the left side, they lasted for a week until they healed, then on the right side which

49
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,740
continued for 2-3 days and then it was over.

50
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,750
During this entire time I constantly had this acrid discharge from the nose, which was

51
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:20,490
hurting the surrounding area.

52
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,490
-The discharge was only from one nostril?

53
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:30,910
-Mainly on the right side. Sometimes also left but most of the times from the right nostril.

54
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:36,160
The pains were wandering. At first was the right shoulder and later on they moved down

55
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:42,410
to my left leg; the entire leg and also my hip. I could not sleep.

56
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:49,660
When I was lying quietly the pains were absolutely unbearable. Also when I was sitting

57
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,910
to write something or to do mental work, I could not sit long. I had to get up and move

58
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,400
my leg.

59
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:04,400
-With movement in the beginning it was bad and then eventually got better or

60
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,650
immediately with the movement got better?

61
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,160
-In the leg the movement ameliorated it immediately. Sometimes when I was sitting and

62
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:19,180
wanted to write it was enough just to move my leg away or I would get up and walk

63
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,570
around with the book, in front of me and then I could also read.

64
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:31,070
Now at the moment the pains are worse in my right shoulder joint.

65
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,830
For a certain period of time the pains were also strong in my hip joints, more on the

66
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,330
right side than on the left.

67
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,320
The pains then were so severe that I already was thinking that I might have a tumor

68
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:53,990
on the bones. In those times I went through my entire life and I was checking whether

69
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:59,490
I had settled my affairs so in case I would die my daughter would not have so many

70
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,710
problems with what I leave.

71
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:08,660
Then I asked myself which tasks in this life I have not yet completed and I found out

72
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,400
it’s many; so I decided I’m not going to die, I’ll stay.

73
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:20,910
-With this reaction, she is going to live very long.

74
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:26,140
-I think I told you the main points, if I go through these pages, I have just written pages

75
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:34,320
pain, pain, pain. The stomach pains reappeared again and again, always for 1-2 days.

76
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:43,820
I felt stronger mentally. In the time before I came here, before I got the remedy I had

77
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:53,570
a growing feeling of weakness, of forgetting things, of deteriorating in a way, as if my life

78
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:59,030
energy was being used up, was leaving.

79
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:05,280
This weakness has only reoccurred at certain times, not so often and I think then it is

80
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:12,440
explainable that it was due to much work and night shifts and not sleeping much.

81
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,110
I also felt stronger towards my mother who lives on the same piece of land with me in her

82
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:25,370
own small house. I can put up barriers more easily now, just to say OK up to here

83
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,030
no further.

84
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:34,270
12-14 weeks after Causticum I also had digestive problems which lasted about 1 week

85
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:42,280
with strong bloatedness and the flatulence had a very strong smell and during that time it was

86
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,500
better if I stayed in my house alone.

87
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:53,440
About 12-15 weeks after Causticum I developed a kind of vulvitis and vaginitis, I had pain

88
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:01,240
for excoriations, a kind of inflammatory. This lasted for about 4 days and during this

89
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:08,000
time I was so bruised and I had such pains that I was walking like a captain

90
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,690
wide legs and I couldn’t ride a bicycle.

91
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,910
-Did she have in the past vaginitis?

92
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,660
-Yes I once had it and if it’s important I can look it up now when it was.

93
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,080
-Yes it is important.

94
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:32,110
-About 6 years ago. Then I received Kreosotum and afterwards it was gone.

95
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,780
This time of course I took nothing.

96
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:44,780
-Very good. This is the time, I can just say during the cold she could have taken

97
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:52,270
Arsenicum or something else, or Allium sepa and if she had the vaginitis, she would

98
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,690
have taken again Kreosotum and just finish the whole reaction. That’s the idea.

99
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,940
Once she understands that of course, she goes through and that is when we can

100
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,440
have the results.

101
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,690
-Yes I understood completely and I behaved accordingly.

102
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,440
But I also understood that my homeopathic treatment which lasted for 10 years

103
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,690
exactly it was always making this mistake. It was a process where I kept receiving

104
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:27,440
remedies for certain disorders, which ameliorated for short time and then the complains

105
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,190
reappeared in a different way.

106
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:37,450
-Exactly and it was deeper and deeper the whole issue of course, as she grew older

107
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,890
and the resistance became less.

108
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:48,860
Because if you remember when she gave us the list of remedies, it was more than

109
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,850
50 remedies.

110
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,780
-No it wasn’t 50 but the problem was that my homeopath she didn’t want to tell me

111
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:06,030
what I received. So I only could retrieve it by going through all my diaries, retracing it

112
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,030
and some I just couldn’t find out.

113
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:15,230
-But this exactly is what happens in everybody who is practicing Homeopathy at this

114
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,970
moment, apart from that School. Everybody else is practicing, you have a badge of

115
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,450
symptoms, you just take this remedy and finish with the symptoms.

116
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:34,410
-I also developed itching on my back. Only my cervical and upper thoracic region

117
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:39,410
It was so strong and unbearable that I constantly had to scratch.

118
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,920
But now it’s gone too.

119
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:52,830
A sensation in my life happened. When I travelled here to Alonissos in September

120
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:58,080
As long as I can remember my entire life I always was nauseous when I was in

121
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,500
movement, in motion, being either in a bus or being a passenger in a car, not when

122
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,200
I’m driving myself but as a passenger.

123
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:14,120
As a child also I could not go on a swing and the worse to be was on a boat.

124
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:20,330
And this time nothing. Not once.

125
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:35,820
-I’m just checking whether Causticum has nausea. Very interesting.

126
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:45,570
-And I tested it again this Sunday. I took a boat trip, on a small boat and again nothing.

127
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:53,370
Half a century I was always nauseous.

128
00:13:53,470 --> 00:14:00,520
-So she went back half a century. She is suffering a lot now.

129
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:10,700
-I prefer not to. I never want to go back to this time, never ever.

130
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,040
-She still has to tell us the dream.

131
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:26,300
-I have strong heat flashes. It had already started a bit before I took Causticum and

132
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,280
I think it has to do with my climacteric period but after Causticum it got stronger

133
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,540
really violent.

134
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:41,700
-She has become in general more warm, apart from the heat flashes?

135
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,700
-Yes. Sometimes it becomes a problem because I have these attacks of perspiration and

136
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:56,460
then my skin and my clothes are wet but I can not tolerate cold moist clothing on my skin.

137
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:04,460
To me it seems, looking at it very carefully, it seems as if I have a bit reduced fears in

138
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,130
some areas but I’m still experimenting with that.

139
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,870
For example with the motorbike I would really like to ride a motorbike and I bought

140
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:21,870
one for myself at home but I can’t ride it because I have such fears and panic attacks.

141
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:28,040
It’s as if already I could foresee what could happen to me, so I have these images, I see

142
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:36,790
myself lying on the ground, smashed and even though nothing happens, I just see it.

143
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:43,790
In these imaginations, these pictures I have from the accidents, the worse part of it

144
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:49,790
is the crash and the pain because I’m very sensitive to pain.

145
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,530
In the past, one and a half week that I’m here, I have had the opportunity to go alone on

146
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,790
a motorbike with other people for which I thank them very much because for me that’s

147
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:04,020
already a sensational and experience to be able to try out.

148
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,270
-Did she use to go on a motorbike in younger age?

149
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:15,030
-No. I never went on a motorbike in my life. I only learned how to ride a bicycle when I

150
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:22,520
was 30 years old and that already was connecting with a lot of fears and anxieties.

151
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:30,770
Now I ride a bicycle without problems.

152
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:36,940
-What she was talking was a motorbike? When she said I feel... when I ride the

153
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,180
motorbike, was a motorbike or a bicycle?

154
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,690
-I bought a motorbike but I don’t dare driving it.

155
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:51,940
-But now she had a motorbike herself here?

156
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,620
-Two years ago I had a motorbike here on the island and I had been taking driving

157
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,600
lessons before that because I want to get rid of the fears, I want to deal with them, I want

158
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,850
to confront myself but it’s not possible.

159
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:13,350
I still have fear sitting behind somebody on a motorbike but I realize now I can deal with

160
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,350
the fact I’m riding with different people and different speeds.

161
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,110
-I understand now.

162
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:27,540
-And this fear of drowning I can also control better now. For many years in the past

163
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,720
I had this feeling that if I should ever get my head under water, I’m going to drown.

164
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:40,180
And during the last 10 years I’ve been working on this problem and try to reduce the fear

165
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,860
bit by bit and now on Alonissos I have been swimming for long passages with my head

166
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:54,020
under the water like a fish and it was great.

167
00:17:54,120 --> 00:18:03,990
-I want to ask a few things concerning her desires for food. Still desire for salt?

168
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,410
-I still have desire for salt but not as extreme.

169
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:14,870
-Has she developed desire perhaps for sweets now? She eats more sweets?

170
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:20,100
-Not more than before, I don’t eat many sweets but what I love in the afternoon is a cup

171
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,210
of tea with two cookies.

172
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:28,120
-What about smoked meat?

173
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:34,620
-I can not eat any meat at all, nothing and I can’t eat any food that has only been

174
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:45,130
standing near smoked meat; I can’t eat that even. Absolutely disgusting.

175
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:52,380
It’s the same with coffee. I have absolute intolerance of coffee.

176
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,370
I can’t feel well even in a room when somebody is cooking coffee.

177
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,630
About 30 years ago I was drinking much coffee. I had many night shifts, I was in

178
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:09,630
the night watch, I always was very tired but I had to work a lot at nights and I couldn’t

179
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:15,880
sleep during the day and I was just poring very strong coffee into me, while walking

180
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:21,790
all the time. Then all of a sudden one day I couldn’t tolerate coffee anymore and since

181
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,480
-Aversion to coffee.

182
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:41,620
Can she tell the dream now?

183
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:50,380
-The current dreams deal with issues of my childhood. Every time is the same issue.

184
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,620
The content of the dreams are such that humiliate me; it has to do with the experiences

185
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:04,120
I made with my grandmother who was deeply convinced that I am bad from the very

186
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:12,630
root upwards. Even when I was a very small child and she had thought or made up

187
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:22,380
special punishment measures for me.

188
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,880
-Punishment measure? That means she would punish her according to her behavior?

189
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:35,400
-I actually never really understood what she punished me for. I always was like why?

190
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,900
What did I do? I didn’t do anything, I always was so good. And she always said, shut up

191
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,900
don’t contradict, don’t ask. So I could never really inquire what this was for?

192
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,400
And if I said, I didn’t do anything, she said, if you didn’t do anything today, it is for what

193
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,650
you did yesterday and for what you will do tomorrow.

194
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:03,900
It was inevitably every day and I knew it will come every day except I didn’t know when

195
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,650
so I could never really prepare for it. I was just shaking because I knew some time

196
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,230
somehow I’m going to get it.

197
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:23,690
I had to prepare for my punishments myself. She set me out into the garden where

198
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:29,900
I had to cut twigs from a tree and bring them in the house and I had to fill a jug with

199
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:42,900
water and wet the twigs. And I can’t tell, I can’t say.

200
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,650
I don’t want to say, I want to get away from it. I don’t want again and again to catch up

201
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:56,150
with me. It keeps catching up with me. I also was never allowed to cry.

202
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:02,400
Nothing was never permitted to go to the outside. We were proper family.

203
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,570
And that’s also a problem I have with my mother because she knew about these things

204
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:14,570
but she tolerated it, she never protected me. Even today when we talk about it, she still

205
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:22,560
is convinced, it’s her opinion that what my grandmother did, was correct.

206
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,570
That is was right.

207
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:32,070
It has led to repeated collapses in the past years because still I can not understand why

208
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:36,270
my family has treated me in this way.

209
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,990
-She was treated in total injustice.

210
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:47,990
-You can put it that way and my grandmother forced me after she punished me to kneel

211
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:55,990
down to kneel down in front of the twigs and to kiss them and to thank them that she is

212
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:03,990
going through the effort of making me a good person, that she put that upon herself

213
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,480
to turn me into a good person.

214
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,270
-Jesus.

215
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:13,010
-I would like to stop now because it’s really pulling me down.

216
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:20,740
-But she does not have to be afraid of these memories because they maybe very

217
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:31,480
traumatic and very hurting but she has to deal with this issue and understand that this

218
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:42,990
was not her fault and cry and eventually maybe she will be able to forgive.

219
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:53,480
It’s a big issue of course but it is too obvious that it was total injustice done to her and all

220
00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:02,820
her problems which developed after that, were because of that behavior.

221
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:09,070
-I know but I’ve cried already so much and it just doesn’t stop and every time I come

222
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:14,320
close to these issues I collapse.

223
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:27,570
-But she will have to do it. She can not avoid the issue. She will have to let herself cry

224
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:36,560
cry, cry and it will be a time when this detoxification will take place, the catharsis, the

225
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:47,070
detoxification of the system. And through this, she will regain much more strength and

226
00:24:47,170 --> 00:25:14,630
concentration and abilities.

227
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:29,380
-Only 12 people were crying. She went out to shout. I don’t have to say many things.

228
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:37,890
What I may say as a prediction of how this case is going.

229
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:44,870
First of all we can see that she is going away from Causticum.

230
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:54,560
That means Causticum is acting and changing the symptomatology.

231
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,800
It is a different case than the previous one.

232
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:12,800
Most probably she will need another remedy in the future, we’ll see. That is one thing.

233
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,560
The symptoms are changing and most probably we should not concentrate in repeating

234
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:23,740
the remedy but rather going into a complementary, like Staphysagria or whatever

235
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,470
Colocynthis, it will depend.

236
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:42,560
But I would like to make a prediction with the constitution of Causticum.

237
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:50,560
But before going to the constitution, it is very interesting that the constitution was formed

238
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:57,560
actually by injustice.

239
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:10,310
I mean total injustice. You can imagine. This grand mother must have been sick person.

240
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:17,310
Hating, with a lot of hatred inside. She was taking it out on the child.

241
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:20,060
-Imagine her child.

242
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,310
-Most probably she has been treated it in a similar manner, maybe.

243
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,060
-Causticum must fight.

244
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:41,050
-Throw a bomb also but you see here the different phases. You see also the

245
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:49,600
individuality. Though we perceive general trends on remedies, we see the individual

246
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,560
expression of these trends.

247
00:27:52,660 --> 00:28:01,220
Here she can not tolerate injustice but injustice has been imposed on her and has

248
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,480
produced state of Causticum.

249
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,920
-I think I have got the impression that is not so much the injustice she has suffered from

250
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:18,890
but it’s humiliation. It’s the strongest feeling she has. These diagonal pains which also

251
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:24,140
has, she takes a remedy, perhaps Staphysagria or Lac Caninum.

252
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:35,640
-Yes. Staphysagria is a possibility, that’s correct. But when she described and she said

253
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:48,810
“warum?” that is really the injustice and she does not understand why she is punished.

254
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:54,520
Then of course she is humiliated as well but mortification, humiliation Causticum comes

255
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:02,730
as well as a strong remedy for this.

256
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:13,720
You see also in this case what I have said many times. Prescribe one remedy, take away

257
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:41,480
reaction is the vaginitis it comes.

258
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:50,140
Are you going to give a remedy? No. Unless it is life threatening.

259
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,640
If it life threatening, you can not say no. You just try to save the life of the patient.

260
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:10,310
But in this case, never. You let it develop and now you see, the complains are mostly

261
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:16,470
on the physical body where she complains about these terrific pains.

262
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:24,980
The pains are so strong now, she is thinking maybe I have cancer. So the complain

263
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:36,220
is there while at the same time at the emotional side, a catharsis is taking place.

264
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:43,730
Come back, again and again and she cries and cries and she will be crying.

265
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:56,220
That is very good, don’t bother about anything. What is even more important is when

266
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:04,140
she is able to say to her mother, that’s enough, up to here, I can ‘t tolerate.

267
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:18,640
The defenses of the body were destroyed by the grand mother.

268
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:27,390
She said, she had no limits. The grand mother felt no resistance from the child.

269
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:35,090
The mother is going to feel the resistance. I have enough, just keep to your place.

270
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:44,300
That is very good reaction and what you expect the best to happen out of this

271
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:08,750
Where now she has this, she has on the hips; eventually it will locate on the finger joints.

272
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:16,720
She is going to have all the disturbance that took place all these years, concentrating

273
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:22,730
upon the joints and in particular the joints of the fingers.

274
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:34,720
You expect these joint pains to calm down and locate themselves into the fingers.

275
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,720
-Why?

276
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:49,720
-Because Causticum in particular affects finger joints. And then you will have to decide

277
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:55,390
whether you repeat Causticum or you give whatever remedy etc.

278
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,550
But don’t interfere with the process.

279
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:05,560
For instance, you see she is trembling, she is so much loaded with emotions.

280
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:13,220
Why don’t we give a remedy to stop that. It’s wrong. This is a good reaction.

281
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:17,140
Like you say the eczema is weeping.

282
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:24,140
Why don’t we give a remedy to stop the weeping of the eczema?

283
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:32,640
Which remedies have weepings? Mezereum, Graphites… just give Graphites.

284
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,140
The whipping will stop. It will dry up the eczema.

285
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:48,890
But then it starts again the problem inside. You see the difference?

286
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,900
-How long you think the pains will go on?

287
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,800
-For years.

288
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:08,550
I don’t know if we will be able to cure the pains completely. I’m not sure.

289
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:24,060
But also you will see a resurrection of the emotional side.

290
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:34,060
All these emotions which are emotions that remember the traumas, once it’s over

291
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:38,550
she will be rejuvenated emotionally. She will be like a child again.

292
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:51,550
She will come back to the childhood. This woman will have emotions like a child.

293
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,040
This is what is happening. That’s why I fight. This is not Homeopathy, what you are

294
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,730
doing; you have to do it in the right way; you have to understand and then I fight

295
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:27,970
and I fight. Why? Because finally I feel it’s so tiring but it is worth it.

296
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:33,480
And many times you have seen me totally exhausted; still I continue.

297
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:42,680
I say still it’s worth it because it is the only way that humanity can go through a

298
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,720
catharsis.

299
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:51,970
Humanity is very sick. We have made ourselves very sick and there is a

300
00:35:52,070 --> 00:36:00,720
possibility of that catharsis and nobody wants to use it. It’ s too difficult.

301
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:06,480
They cant’ do it. No, it’s not too difficult. It can be done!

302
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:10,970
-Do you think there is a connection, she has been punished very badly and

303
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:16,470
she knows these cramps and pains in joints and extremities, as if she was

304
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,230
punished. Do you feel that is the connection between that?

305
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:26,220
-Yes, what she says, my bones are broken. She exactly describes the symbolic

306
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:36,770
effect of the hit of the grandmother. Of course she describes the same thing.

307
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:41,480
And she has to go through. And the organism, the defense mechanism brings it

308
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:46,490
down now to the physical body and only to the physical. She is going to suffer a lot

309
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:55,680
with the pains, excruciating pains and we have to watch and say, wait, wait.

310
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:06,390
It’s unbelievable but what can you do? There is no way to get away.

311
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:20,270
There is no case, I can assure you, in the West that can go through just like that

312
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:29,270
a traumatic experience of that type. There is no way, under no circumstances.

313
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:37,020
Never mind what they say, magic, herbs, acupuncture, whatever.

314
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:43,770
The process is painful, if it is correct it’s going to be painful.

315
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:56,270
But painful on less and less deeper levels, more external.

316
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:03,720
-She even said that the pain she has is like beaten. She even said this.

317
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:13,350
-Yes broken like I was beaten. Of course she was beaten in mental level but the

318
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:20,110
defense mechanism is taking this memory and brings it down to the physical body.

319
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:32,350
More and more.

320
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:38,310
If you remember in the first time I said, get into the essential, don’t be lost in

321
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:45,620
details, you will lose the remedy. Who was in the first consultation?

322
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:54,970
Everybody was here? Was somebody who was not in the first consultation?
