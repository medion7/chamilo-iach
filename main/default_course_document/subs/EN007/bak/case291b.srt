1
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:30,720
-On the 25th of September last year I got Causticum C200 by you at 4.55.

2
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:39,470
I went back into the hall, sat down and the lecture began and I had the impression like an icy

3
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,140
cold wind was going through the room, a draft.

4
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:51,720
Then I realized  that if it would have been a draft, it would have gone on the other direction

5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:58,740
and the other hand it was very warm in the room but it was so icy cold, there was a coldness that

6
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:05,080
was going along my vertex and was taking over the hall out the heat.

7
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,330
That was going on about 3-4 minutes and then I had the impression that I was sitting under

8
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:15,390
wave of pressure. An enormous wave of pressure, that was coming from upwards down

9
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:21,180
and would press me down into my seat. Like in a lift when suddenly the lift goes up.

10
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:30,600
And I had the impression I can’t stand up anymore but I could move hands and legs.

11
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:43,740
At the same time I had like a strong blowing of a wind in my head but it was going on for about

12
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:52,420
15 min. and then this wave of pressure would go down slowly, like a line.

13
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,920
When it reached by here for the first time after 15 years I had something that I hadn’t known

14
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:08,930
anymore, I had a free brain. And then I realized how I had been living for the last 15 years.

15
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:18,430
At the same time it was getting warm all over my body. I was craving to hold my neighbor and

16
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:29,420
he said, you are completely warm and when some days later my husband would meet me at

17
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,430
the airport, he would say, you are so warm, you must have fever.

18
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:40,170
That was the first time in my life that I felt hot, warm. That was the first day.

19
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:47,440
I was very tired and when I get to dinner that night I realized that I couldn’t see the greasy

20
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:54,940
sauce of the salad, I had to take any slice of tomato, take it out, clean it properly to take off

21
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,030
all the oily stuff.

22
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,000
The next morning when I woke up I had a very big pimple under my right eye and the whole

23
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,260
front was covered with little pimples  and that was going on for 4 to 5 days.

24
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,010
Every day, every morning a big pimple that was moving from here to there and after 5 days

25
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,340
the pain came on.

26
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,580
I compared it with fireworks. They were sometimes here, sometimes there without any order

27
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,330
without any systematic.

28
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,840
-Mostly in the extremities?

29
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:42,340
-No all over. Very much in the right chest, then the joints again, the knees, the hands.

30
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:48,260
The knees pains are always there, they have been on since I guess Causticum has been

31
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:58,260
acting and I evaluate the acting of Causticum concerning the existence of the pain.

32
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,000
At the same time my visual disturbances got worse. It happened to me when I was sitting

33
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:10,250
something that I haven’t had before. I said, what is going on? Do they have an earthquake

34
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,030
here, what is going on? Then I went back to Germany and during this week, after Causticum

35
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:20,760
this heaviness was gradually going down continuously.

36
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,190
After two weeks it was settled down on my legs but to such an extend that I could hardly work

37
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:31,830
anymore. When the traffic light was so green, I couldn’t manage to get across the road in the

38
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:37,850
time of the green. I had to stop the car so I could cross the road and I’m a person who is

39
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:46,840
running from morning till night but it didn’t work anymore.

40
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,080
My children went excited about it because they were used that when they would cry mama

41
00:04:52,180 --> 00:05:00,090
from the second floor, I would jump up or when the telephone was ringing or the door bell

42
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,830
I was running from morning to night. And that wouldn’t work anymore.

43
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,600
In fact Causticum did what psychotherapists didn’t succeed for 9 years.

44
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:16,590
Finally my little daughter who is 9 years old said, I hate this Causticum.

45
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:24,830
This heaviness in my leg would go on for about 3 weeks; in the meantime I got warts but they

46
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:33,350
went back, later on. One morning everything was over. I could run again, I was nervous, I was

47
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:43,030
irritable, one of the children said, you act like addicted and for 3 days I felt like this.

48
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,230
First I thought what did I do to antidote the remedy and then I thought the remedy started

49
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:55,420
very quickly, so it ends very abruptly. For quite some time I didn’t think about it but now

50
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:03,340
afterwards I realized that I influenced the remedy a lot.

51
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,340
For example, once we had an accident in front of our house, a little girl had been hit by car.

52
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:17,090
When I heard the noise of the breaks, I went outside and said, for god sake where are my

53
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:23,840
children? And I saw this child in front of the car, I could see it was not my child but I was

54
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:31,080
paralyzed. In this situation, in the days following, I got quick again.

55
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,590
Some time later I repeated the remedy and it succeeded again and I realized suddenly that

56
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:42,010
the remedy was acting again even though I thought it had ended long before.

57
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:48,000
For example, when I had a good case, it was successful with the patient and my practice

58
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,750
and I was telling that in my family, then suddenly these shooting pains would come again.

59
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,760
Then I thought what could have been or what could have done that could antidote or ruin

60
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:06,010
the remedy? I have to say this, the first weeks with Causticum were like vacations for me.

61
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:14,520
I didn’t learn, I didn’t do anything, I didn’t do any exertion, I was just hanging out, like

62
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,250
vacations. And it was very unusual for me because I like to learn, even when I was an

63
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:26,010
interpreter I would learn a 100 vocabulary over night, just for joy.

64
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:32,260
-What I want to know is what happened with the conditions that she came to be treated here.

65
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,930
The neurological conditions, all this time.

66
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:41,570
-All gone, no more.

67
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:48,610
-Because you didn’t say that. You forgot to say that.

68
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:57,200
-That’s true. They were immediately gone, the visual disturbances first were worse and after

69
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,940
one week they subsided.

70
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:05,540
My disturbances in talking went on for about 3-4 weeks and then they were gone too.

71
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:11,710
Then I antidoted the remedy with a case that it really took a dramatic outcome.

72
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:19,950
I called this patient in the morning and then I got the bad news and when I hang in, it was

73
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,450
finished.

74
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,200
-From the patient?

75
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:44,600
-From the panaritium she got asbcess on the tonsils. I think I suppressed it.

76
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:51,600
-She interpreted that she suppressed.

77
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,850
-From one second to the next on that day, it was all over.

78
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,350
-Then what happened?

79
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:05,350
-Everything was normal again and this neurological disturbances never came back again.

80
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,350
I didn’t mention because I consider it not to be so important because I have a chronic

81
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:16,350
bronchitis. The two weeks that the bronchitis would come, it would stay for 3 weeks and

82
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,850
then it would take another 3 weeks to go away, to bring out all the mucus and then the

83
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,850
next bronchitis would start all over again. Three weeks after I’ve had antidoted the remedy

84
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,940
I started coughing and that was unusual. I didn’t know that before because normally I would

85
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,840
get rhinitis and my throat would get inflamed and then the cough would start.

86
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,760
I had a slight bronchitis over 5 days and it was over.

87
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,860
-Without medication.

88
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,720
That is good. Now you know why it was good.

89
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:00,420
-One month later I had a second cold and that time it started with the rhinitis and then sore throat

90
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,590
and then bronchitis all within one week. By that time we’re in the beginning of December and

91
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,750
then in the middle of December I had a terrible stress. I say terrible, it wasn’t terrible at all.

92
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:22,000
Just one colleague would quit my office but for me was a drama and I was all done.

93
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:30,750
I repeated the C200. I had again this strong blowing like a wind in my head but it was not

94
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,500
as it is pronounced. Some hours later, the pain started all over again.

95
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,700
That was going on for about 4 weeks and I think the remedy had a hard time because I was

96
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,420
so stressed to find a new colleague.

97
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:52,420
When the pains were over, one day I came home at noon with an attack of fatigue, of

98
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:58,660
tiredness, I took a 1M. That was in February.

99
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,920
-But during all this time, never the neurological symptoms reappeared from the very

100
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:12,660
beginning? It was only the acutes and the stresses?

101
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:19,920
-Yes. I think that the globules didn’t get dissolved when the pain started.

102
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,670
-Immediately.

103
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:31,910
-And that was going on for about 3 sec. and 3 sec. later the pain started again.

104
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:41,110
When I took the 1M I got a little slow again and this is gradually faded away till Easter.

105
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:48,580
And since Easter I realized I have lethargy in my brain. I do things automatically.

106
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,500
Recently I had a situation like this, I was going for shopping and then I didn’t buy anything but

107
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:04,660
like everybody else I would queue up and then it was my turn and nothing in my basket

108
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,120
because I didn’t buy anything but I didn’t realize.

109
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,580
Before Causticum situations like that were 3 times the day. And I realized how gradually it

110
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,830
calmed down again but the disturbances are gone.

111
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:25,280
I had a chronic cystitis but I didn’t really realize because I was always drinking a lot and about

112
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:36,500
two weeks ago, I didn’t have the possibility to drink so much and in the evening I said,

113
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,000
nothing.

114
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:46,170
-She thought that cystitis will start but it did not started.

115
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:53,910
-Nothing. Now I drink about half a liter per day and nothing happens.

116
00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:04,830
Another thing that I didn’t mention is that I do have a low blood pressure. Margaret took my

117
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,330
-Always she had that?

118
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,090
-Yes.

119
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:20,110
-After Causticum the blood pressure went up a little bit or not at all, it just remained the same?

120
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:32,120
-I measured it about one week ago and then I had 110 to 70.

121
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:38,860
-Very good. Is she happy?

122
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:47,360
-Absolutely. What else did I have? My fatigue, my tiredness got very much better.

123
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,780
Sometimes throughout the day I had like holes, I could do anything anymore, I had to go to

124
00:13:51,880 --> 00:14:00,020
bed and in February before I repeated the 1M, they came up again for the last time.

125
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:09,030
Now I can manage without sleeping in the afternoon and this is something new.

126
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:12,770
Another thing you asked me and I never mentioned it before.

127
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:22,040
You asked me if I lose some drops of urine when I sneeze or laugh and I said it’s not a matter

128
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:27,530
of some drops, it’s a matter of half a liter. And my sister was coming to see me and she has

129
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:36,020
the same problem and I always had these accidents when I was with her.

130
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:44,950
Over Easter I always manage to be on time going to the toilet. The urge to go to urinate is

131
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,440
there but it’s much better.

132
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:51,860
-What she means is she is not losing anymore urine?

133
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,860
-Hardly any or she manages to reach the toilet before the urine comes.

134
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:04,110
Another thing that turned up newly is that I clench my teeth.

135
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,810
-She can not relax the jaw?

136
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:12,780
-I can do it when I do it consciously but automatically I would clench my teeth again.

137
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,030
And I didn’t have that before. That’s all.

138
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:53,090
-Very descriptive, very dramatic. Thank you.

139
00:15:53,190 --> 00:16:03,590
I don’t have much to say. She said everything.

140
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:18,880
Group 3, upper layer, going to this layer, we’ll see what happens. This is the idea, very good.

141
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:29,840
Do you remember that when I was analyzing her case, she was sitting there.

142
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:43,260
And she thought that I made some remarks for Uta that I had insulted Uta for not doing

143
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:58,300
correct translation. Then I had to apologize because she was strong.

144
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:11,260
She said, listen. It’s nice to put it back to see what a Causticum feels when he/she thinks

145
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:20,480
he sees unfairness, injustice, they can not hold back, they will attack.

146
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:30,480
She said, you do not know what we’re going through and I noticed this, in her analysis I put

147
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:42,390
that, you remember?

148
00:17:42,490 --> 00:18:13,310
You have good memory. It was the final touch in her case. Wait.

149
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:25,970
From last time, no remedy. Causticum C1000 one year ago?

150
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:33,730
-No, one year ago  I received the C200 and between I repeated in 1M.

151
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,730
When I was here the last time I had reported that I had the feeling that again I was having

152
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:46,400
these empty stages. Then I went home again and about 1-2 weeks later, the following

153
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,390
happened.

154
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,890
I wanted to pick up a child from school, I was driving the car, I went to school, stopped, got

155
00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:00,150
out of the car and took my child by the hand and I was walking back to the car with it.

156
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:21,140
Then I went into the car and left leaving the child standing there.

157
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,140
In the mirror I saw the child standing there but I didn’t react.

158
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,640
-When she realized that?

159
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:40,390
-When I arrived home. Thank god my kids are used to it and they come home with

160
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:49,400
somebody but the same day I went to my clinic and took 1M.

161
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:56,640
And it was gone immediately. After the second 1M, I developed small warts.

162
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:06,390
I had also had them after the C200. They developed around the eyes, they came out and

163
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:14,100
then they went away again, within 2-3 weeks, exactly the same reaction like after the C200.

164
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:26,060
-With C200 and with 1M the first time and then again the second time? Now they stay out?

165
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,510
-Now they remain. The way they are now, it’ not much.

166
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:40,060
-But this is the full? It’s not that they are half out now.

167
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:47,060
-No, they came out in the beginning and then they went back. So they were fully developed

168
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,150
for a time and now they are in the lower third concerning the development.

169
00:20:52,250 --> 00:21:04,700
-Concerning the development is 1/3 of the full extend?

170
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:13,110
-Yes. Then the summer went on without any new things happening and when the summer

171
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:20,860
was finished, at the end of the summer, I realized that something incredible had happened.

172
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,280
I had reported that when laughing I always had a strong weakness of the bladder.

173
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:31,270
If you remember I had reported that no matter where I was, if I was in a restaurant, in a shop

174
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:39,770
out on the street, if I had to laugh my bladder emptied itself immediately completely.

175
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:45,940
Then I realized that this had been the first summer without any incontinence but what was

176
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,690
even better is that this hysterical laughing had also stopped.

177
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:57,530
I would say that the weakness of the bladder has become even worse. I already feel the

178
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:03,360
urge to urinate when I wash my hands but I’m not incontinent anymore.

179
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:10,110
Only then I realized how important this laughing was and how often it had occurred.

180
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:15,340
When for instance somebody told a joke, I laughed two or three times,

181
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,840
then peed into my pants

182
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,330
at the tenth time somebody had to mention only one word for a joke and it all happened

183
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:31,060
immediately. Sometimes already just a glance was enough.

184
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,070
I was laughing, I woke up at nights laughing until I almost suffocated.

185
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,070
-Remembering the joke?

186
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:50,570
-No, without reason. Sometimes I had pains sciatica and I was laughing due to the pain

187
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,230
laughing until the tears were streaming down my face.

188
00:22:54,330 --> 00:23:02,740
And this laughing stopped. That was after the second 1M.

189
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:11,150
Today I can not understand at all why I never felt a problem with this incontinence.

190
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:17,650
Why I never discussed it as a problem. I had no feeling of shame with it; it was like

191
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,900
blowing your nose.

192
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,170
-Very interesting.

193
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:30,480
-When the summer holidays ended, I suddenly had very intense herpes without having a

194
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:38,740
cold. Usually when I develop thisherpes I always have a cold accompanied, this time not.

195
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,740
-Did she do something?

196
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,820
-Then a couple of weeks later I developed a cold, this time without the herpes. It was a

197
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:56,830
severe cold and what was special about – usually when our family get a cold, the children

198
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:02,490
get it, one after the other and the very last person to become ill is me – this time I was

199
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,490
ill right from the beginning, along with them.

200
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:13,500
This time again a cold without bronchitis. This is new since I got the remedy for the first time.

201
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,950
Twenty years ago they diagnosed me with chronic bronchitis.

202
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:26,500
The situation today is as follows: Again I have this emptiness in my head. It’s not a feeling

203
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,990
of having forgotten something. If I feel I have forgotten something, then I feel OK because

204
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:38,240
I can go and look what I have forgotten. It’s a feeling of complete disorientation.

205
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,500
For example, I couldn’t tell you at that moment, is it noon or afternoon.

206
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,240
I had the following situation this morning which happens in different varieties repeatedly.

207
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:57,020
I was standing in my room all dressed up and ready and then I had to think what is supposed

208
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:04,190
to happen now? I was holding my key in my hand and my view went from the key to the door

209
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:08,410
and I put the key to the door and locked the door from the inside.

210
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,520
Then I thought I wanted to go to the Academy and tried to open the door and I realized

211
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,070
no, you just locked it. That’s a typical situation.

212
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:22,830
I’m not able to make a connection between two situations.

213
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:27,490
Like I’m standing in the gas station and somebody is telling me your gasoline tank of your

214
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:34,160
car is empty, we’re not going to get home this way and I say yes and there I am with an

215
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:45,160
empty tank, I see the signal and I see the gas station but I continue. I don’t fill.

216
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:53,410
Next to this stage I also had in the beginning severe blackouts, these did not come back.

217
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:59,160
These disturbances of vision that the ground is moving up and down and I couldn’t walk

218
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,410
these also have not returned.

219
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:07,830
The only thing I have is the insecurity when walking if the ground is glistening.

220
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:19,320
Like the last days it had rained, I was a bit insecure.

221
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:27,080
I make mistakes in talking when speaking, always in the evening when relaxing.

222
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:32,170
It is exactly the kind of talking mistakes you made the other day, it always has to do with

223
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:42,160
words that are very similar, like you wanted to say Digitalis and you said Vegetalis.

224
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:47,140
They are back the 21st of August, I can tell you the exact date.

225
00:26:47,240 --> 00:27:00,090
-What happened? Was any particular stress that took place two days before?

226
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:00,750
-No.

227
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:06,500
-When this eruption came out?

228
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:20,250
-Before school holidays in summer. About 4 weeks after the remedy.

229
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:33,840
-Was any thing that made her sad because the child did not go well to school?

230
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,340
Little things like that?

231
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:50,090
-There are permanently some small things going on, nothing special.

232
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:57,890
I had complained about strong fatigue, especially in the lunch break between noon and

233
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:05,600
4 o’clock. It’s still the time where I feel tired but it has got a lot better.

234
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:13,600
What has not changed at all is the intolerance of cooked food, warm food.

235
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:27,350
When I came here, one year ago, I only was eating raw foods, uncooked.

236
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,300
-Warm food aggravates.

237
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:37,010
-Then I thought Causticum will take care of it and slowly I started to eat normally again

238
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:43,300
and again I developed problems with my lymph nodes, the abscesses of my teeth started again

239
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:49,610
my lower eyelids were very swollen and the problem with the lymph nodes finally got so bad

240
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:55,370
that I woke at nights with pain and could not lie on the sides anymore.

241
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:01,030
After that bit by bit I went back to raw foods.

242
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:03,810
-Does she like raw food?

243
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:16,360
-Yes but I do like but living on this island here for the time being it means choriatiki [greek salad]

244
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:25,860
without cheese, morning, noon and at nights and in between eating grapes. That’s it.

245
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,860
-She likes fruits?

246
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,970
-Not especially. It’s difficult for me to tell you any clear food modality because I have such

247
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:41,690
frustration with my diet. I would like to eat some other things in between.

248
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:53,350
-Something which is warm, anything which is warm does not like or makes her worse?

249
00:29:53,450 --> 00:30:01,760
-IF buy almonds in the super market sometimes which have been heated, I immediately have

250
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:11,850
an allergic reaction. My nose closes up. The only modality concerning food I can tell you

251
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:27,340
which is very clear, is the desire for oysters. I always had that and once I gave in to this

252
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:45,100
desire and during one meal I ate 70 oysters. The day after 50.

253
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,100
-And she was not sick after that?

254
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,010
-No.

255
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,260
-And it was cooked?

256
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,430
-No.

257
00:30:53,530 --> 00:31:06,340
-Raw, with lemon. It’s clear desire.

258
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:18,850
-When our family eats oysters, I go from plate to plate and collect the oyster water.

259
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:26,840
After the first dose of Causticum I had a complete loss of my sexual desire and this lasted

260
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:31,510
for months.

261
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:41,010
-Now it came back?

262
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:51,260
-A little bit. It’s not an aversion. I’m just absolutely not interested and I don’t understand

263
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,510
what it’s all about.

264
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,680
-She was interested before?

265
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:09,170
-I never approached a man like a lioness but it was better.

266
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:14,450
What I like very much and I think it already happened after the first dose of Causticum is

267
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:20,620
that I don’t have the feeling anymore I have to dance on many different weddings at once

268
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,760
as we say in Germany. I can easily say no and not do something.

269
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:32,470
I also stopped making thousands of plans. I usually belong to that kind of people who

270
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:37,180
constantly initiate some citizens activities and so on.

271
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,680
-Social mostly?

272
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:47,430
-Not only but usually I don’t carry through them because I don’t’ have the energy.

273
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:49,680
-So she stopped doing that?

274
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:59,340
-It was one specific situation and after that it never came back. I studied germanistic.

275
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,090
-She studied German? She is German?

276
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:12,000
-No I am French. I was driving with the car and my thoughts went around the issue of how

277
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:21,560
to do with the slow fading of certain grammatic thing. I said that is going to be the issue of my

278
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,060
promotion, of being a doctor.

279
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:35,600
-Promoted?

280
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:46,560
-For a scientific publication which later on makes you doctor. Before I would have done

281
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,970
everything immediately to get things started. I would have looked for a Professor at the

282
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:56,760
University, I would have got my material ready, get ready to write. One of those thinking

283
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,780
was I was standing in a traffic jam, standing there for about 20 minutes. By the time I came

284
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:12,700
out of this traffic jam, the whole issue was over. Finished.

285
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,450
And I never again planned any of these things anymore. With such things I could easily

286
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:22,060
raise my blood pressure from 80 to 120. That’s all.

287
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:34,200
-It’s still like that but that’s something I forgot to write down. When I started coming to

288
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:40,370
-Can she tolerate something around her neck?

289
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:44,560
-No problem.

290
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:51,300
-She has said about injustice, she cannot support it, how does she feel about that?

291
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:59,320
-That has remained unchanged.

292
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:08,140
-Also she has mentioned that her tongue sticks to the palate.

293
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:16,250
-Yes I can remember it was a situation that my mouth was dry but not anymore.

294
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:21,300
-What about menses? She mentioned that they were intermitted.

295
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:27,430
It's still like that but something I forgot to write down when I started coming to

296
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:32,830
you the menses had become very little, only about two days of flow and after Causticum

297
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:39,820
it came again fully, like it used to. And it went backwards until I repeated the remedy

298
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,070
then it came fully again and then slowly it ceased and then after repeated again.

299
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:49,250
-How is the last time she had menses?

300
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,740
-Short, two days.

301
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,820
-Period it was in beginning of September?

302
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,610
-Yes.

303
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,070
-Again short?

304
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:31,740
-Yes, two days.

305
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:48,350
The same question, shall we wait, shall we repeat, shall we give another remedy?

306
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:52,030
-She did not put any ointment on herpes?

307
00:36:52,130 --> 00:37:08,270
-No, she did not.

308
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:44,520
Wait 18, repeat 43, another remedy 1. Higher?

309
00:37:44,620 --> 00:38:02,180
Higher 43.

310
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,430
We agree, this is the right answer.

311
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:15,680
She has a relapse. She proves also that she goes into relapses. We don’t know why but

312
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:22,920
anyhow she goes into relapses and anyhow she has some characteristic symptoms.

313
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:38,330
The relapses are milder and milder and therefore is a matter of the strength of the remedy.

314
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:50,080
So the remedy has to be stronger, it has to bring out these little warts.

315
00:38:50,180 --> 00:39:03,840
Show me the symptoms that we put. Condylomata, urging to urinate frequently

316
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:13,330
spasmodic laughing, this should take it away because she does not have it anymore.

317
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:24,330
Spasmodic laughing that is the rubric actually for her. Eruptions, herpes, lips about

318
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:41,430
makes mistakes in time, in speaking, transposing sounds, weariness in the afternoon

319
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:56,680
warm food aggravates, abscess of teeth of roots, raw food desire, oysters desire

320
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:10,420
sexual desire wanting and can not support injustice, menses scanty.

321
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:17,550
Desire for oysters and raw food is there?

322
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:27,990
-Yes, three times.

323
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:38,330
-No desire for raw food.

324
00:40:38,430 --> 00:41:10,070
-OK we take it out. Let me see the columns. Causticum, Lachesis, why? Explain Lachesis.

325
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:18,820
Desire oysters is very strong, warm food aggravates also is very strong.

326
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:38,320
So she has some strong Lachesis symptoms. But we say good bye Lachesis.

327
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:47,580
It is interesting another small remedy that we have to look. Lycopus which has two strong

328
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:58,430
desires of hers. They are in Lycopus, raw food and oysters desire.

329
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:22,430
If you take away from Repertorisation raw food, no change.

330
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:32,850
Therefore still she is with the symptomatology, she is still on the picture of Causticum

331
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:44,770
only on a milder level, on a better level but still on Causticum.

332
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:50,110
Therefore we go higher and we give Causticum 10M this time.

333
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:56,360
-Did you see the desire oysters in Causticum before?

334
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:10,110
-If I remember every symptom which I’ve seen, I would be with a head like this.

335
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:16,360
You know how many symptoms we can be adding in the Repertory? A lot, out of the

336
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:22,360
cases that we have seen these 50 cases, a lot of new symptoms.

337
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:31,290
These symptoms actually have to be noted down and confirmed. And yesterday was a

338
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:55,060
symptom about sea sickness, I said you can put it in the Repertory. That was cured really.

339
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:07,280
It was very strong as a symptom and very clear and because it belongs to a totality, then you

340
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,460
take it out.

341
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:17,870
Don’t take symptoms into consideration when there is one symptom, just the change of a

342
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:27,810
symptom, you don’t take it into consideration but when you have a curative reaction and you

343
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:41,290
have a clear symptom which is gone clearly, then you noted in your Repertory.

344
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:46,700
-My husband is Causticum too and he has enormous desire for oysters.

345
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:53,620
-Yes?

346
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,370
-He can eat 50 oysters at the time.

347
00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:07,820
-But in order to put this a symptom of Causticum, it has to be cured by Causticum.

348
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,500
That means I will take into consideration as a Causticum symptom when she says after

349
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:22,790
2 years perhaps that I don’t have anymore desire for oysters. Only then I can consider it

350
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:30,440
for Causticum. Otherwise I will consider that it belongs to another remedy which maybe will

351
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:47,700
be needed in 2 years time. I have seen desire that goes very slowly away.

352
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:56,980
Desire for milk and it can be 2 years, desire for salt it can be 2 years before the patient says

353
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:21,570
I need less salt. Because it’s habit, it’s tastes, it’s different other things which play.

354
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:30,320
First of all I’m doing fine and this is the first time I come for follow up without having a relapse

355
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,240
on the neurological sphere.

356
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:39,240
Before it was always so that if I had an acute state, afterwards I always would have a relapse

357
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:45,990
that I don’t recognize my house anymore or miss an airplane. Since my final follow up in May

358
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:52,740
after which I repeated the remedy, I had four months in which I had three acute states but

359
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,740
no relapse at all.

360
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:00,990
First of all when I was here for the last time there was something that I did not report

361
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:05,490
because it had only happened once and I did not memorize it.

362
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:11,100
When I was going for walk I had developed sudden stitching pains in the lumbar area of my

363
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,050
spine and I could not continue walking. My husband drove me home, I had problems

364
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:21,540
getting in and out of the car but then I took a hot bath, it disappeared and I just forgot

365
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:27,520
about it. In the beginning of June I developed tensions spasms in my shoulder and cervical

366
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:33,520
area but it got so severe that within three weeks, I was not able to move my head.

367
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:38,520
Neither to the right, nor to the left, nor down, I couldn’t read anymore, I could only turn

368
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:49,760
entirely, I could only move like a statue. I consulted an orthopedic physician and he said

369
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:57,420
I cannot do anything because everything is so tight. I couldn’t even tolerate a massage

370
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:03,800
because the pain, the tension was so strong. It was shortly before I wanted to go on

371
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:08,710
vacation and I would have to drive 1000 km with my car.

372
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:14,220
One night, in the middle of the night I had this panic thought. What do I do? I can’t drive.

373
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:20,230
And since I always carry Causticum with me, I just took three pills. The pains were gone

374
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:31,130
within 10 sec. and I regained 80% of my ability to move within about 10 min.

375
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:37,050
And I went on vacation and I took care of the rest and then I thought I really had 8 children

376
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:44,290
with me, that was not really the way to relax and recover but then I thought now I will be

377
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:48,560
better when school is starting again and I’m getting rid of the kids but I got even more

378
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,110
tired.

379
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:54,860
One day I was standing in my kitchen working. I must have made some wrong movement

380
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:02,150
I don’t know which one and I tried to redo the whole thing in front of camera.

381
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:21,060
I couldn’t move anything except my hands and my feet, those were the only parts.

382
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,890
a couple of min. I felt how my circulation was going down, my eyelids got really heavy

383
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:31,180
and I felt if this continues I’ m going to faint. I could not have called anybody, I couldn’t

384
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:39,680
reach the phone, so again I took out my little pills of Causticum. I took a couple of pills

385
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:48,250
I don’t remember how many. Immediately I was back. Maybe it took 1-2 min. and then

386
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:54,820
I could breathe again, after 2-3 min. the spasms disappeared, the head was free again.

387
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,410
And after about 5 min. I stood up erect.

388
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:05,660
The dorsal area was free but still I was inhibited in my motion.

389
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,160
Lumbar and sacral region were stiff like concrete.

390
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,900
After the shock I had to sleep for two hours

391
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,820
I woke and the lower region was stiff again, similar the next morning and the next morning

392
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:25,570
I was absolutely exhausted. The only thought was back to bed.

393
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:31,330
I took a 50 M and within half an hour the pain in my lumbar region disappeared and after one

394
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:39,320
hour the pain in the sacral region was gone and after 3 hours I had my energy back.

395
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,070
This was in the middle of August.

396
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:46,740
Then I felt quite well and suddenly at the end of August it happened again.

397
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:52,740
Quickly, day by day the energy went down and one day it was so severe that I went back

398
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:57,740
to bed in the morning because I could not stand anymore.

399
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:03,160
But I couldn’t sleep, then I had lunch thought it maybe that would make it better and it didn’t

400
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:10,150
work, so I went back to bed but still I couldn’t sleep and I could sense this is no normal

401
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:18,290
exhaustion. So I repeated what I always carry with me, a 10M and 5-15 min. later I was back.

402
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:23,540
That was two weeks ago and since then I’ve been quite well with it.

403
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:29,960
On my way travelling to Alonissos, just before, I got a cold. The first one this year.

404
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:39,200
Before Causticum it was one week of fatigue, then 6 weeks of bronchitis, then I had

405
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,950
And the cold I got now lasted for 3 days.

406
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:51,540
After the cold when it was over suddenly one night I had an attack of irritating cough.

407
00:51:51,640 --> 00:52:03,280
It was so intense, it lasted for half an hour, I thought it was tearing apart my mucus membranes. I just grabbed my little bottle and sniffed at it, it stopped immediately.

408
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:07,040
In general I would say, I think I’m more hungry than before.

409
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:16,040
-You put 1 kilo. You don’t know?

410
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:28,530
-I don’t weigh myself and I’m not as chilly during the night as I was.

411
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:32,990
After the repetitions of the remedy, I had some symptoms which also disappeared.

412
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:38,450
One of them was that I had a pain in my joint when opening the mouth, I had a whistling

413
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:45,950
noise in my left ear and what is new, since a while now, is that I wake in the morning

414
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:52,700
at 5 o’clock, I’m awake, refreshed but if I get up then, I go downhill again within

415
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,940
half an hour. And if I get up at 7, I’m tired.

416
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,670
Most probably is either here or here.

417
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:00,420
-She goes back to sleep?

418
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,950
-I go back to sleep, then I wake up at 7 and I get up, then I’m tired.

419
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:05,670
Her pathology, you remember what I told you in the very beginning of the teaching?

420
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:10,670
Basically it always has been like that; I had these sudden drops of energy.

421
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,680
Just, before I went down to a much deeper level.

422
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:20,680
I have the feeling that I would be doing better if I could repeat more frequently.

423
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:27,840
On the other side I’m a bit timid to repeat these high potencies so much and I just wait

424
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:32,590
quite a while until I take them and that’s why I have these ups and downs.

425
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:40,590
-It’s good she waits because then the remedy acts. The picture is there and if she takes

426
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:45,330
it too early, maybe it will have no effect.

427
00:53:45,430 --> 00:54:12,190
Thank you.

428
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:35,180
I want to say a few things concerning her case, concerning the groups. 1,2,3,4 where is she?

429
00:54:35,280 --> 00:55:01,350
Is she here? No. Is she here? No. Is she here? No. Yes. Is she here? No. Yes.

430
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:18,710
The idea is that in spite of the fact of having severe pathology in the beginning.

431
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:29,100
That you may have severe pathology in all these groups. Here you have cancer, paralysis

432
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,490
everything.

433
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:39,540
The same you have here. The difference is that here the remedy is clear, the remedy stays.

434
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,540
Here, you need a lot of remedies.

435
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:59,620
She has severe pathology which is on the nervous system, central and peripheral and the

436
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:10,370
remedy stays the same when the pathology from the nervous system, central and peripheral

437
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:14,370
goes into the muscular.

438
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:24,040
What she describes is muscular cramps of different types. So the muscular system now

439
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:35,240
takes the impact of the disease, of the focus of the disease; yet the remedy is the same.

440
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:43,910
So most probably she is on that level, upper second level.

441
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:52,130
In spite of the fact she was looking one of the most severe cases. She says oh my god.

442
00:56:52,230 --> 00:57:07,630
Yet the remedy was clear. The remedy stays, that is a very good sign.

443
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:15,620
But you saw how you can, more or less, place the pathology. Because in the beginning

444
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:24,370
you say, how do we know, how do we place? Immediately you know where it is.

445
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:43,870
Here you have acutes, she is going to have more acutes. Most probably she was here

446
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:57,800
and now she is here and perhaps soon will be on that level. The same remedy.

447
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:10,710
What is your prescription now? Change the remedy?

448
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:24,130
Another interesting thing is that you see, when the organism is really in a good condition

449
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:32,620
it makes a clear picture and then it’s very sensitive to the remedy.

450
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:39,540
She even smells and there is an effect.

451
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:49,830
You like it to be like this but not everybody is lucky.
