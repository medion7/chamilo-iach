1
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:30,090
-This is not my patient but who is your doctor?

2
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:56,270
-...I have heard that Homeopathy may have some result of helping people with the same

3
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:13,690
disease who keep functioning almost normally by using this kind of terrible medicine.

4
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,200
-Can you repeat because I do not understand?

5
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,620
-He just said that he has heard that Homeopathy can help this type of illness.

6
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,480
-Has he taken homeopathic remedies already?

7
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,970
-He has taken two remedies. He is taking Rhus tox right now and before he took one other

8
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:41,390
remedy… What was the other remedy you took?

9
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,170
-Arnica.

10
00:01:45,270 --> 00:02:07,980
-So he is 54 years old and 6 years ago he developed larynx spasms and one year ago he

11
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,130
noticed some minor difficulty with his voice, as well as mild weakness in the left arm and

12
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:20,960
the left leg. So he started to get some weakness.

13
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:29,750
-In the left side, left arm and left leg.

14
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:36,720
-This was one year ago, you started to get some weakness.

15
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,210
Can you stand up for a moment?

16
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,040
-It’s a bit hard.

17
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:53,800
-Can you walk a little bit, so help him to walk.

18
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,970
-No, I’m OK.

19
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:15,260
I have a brace in both ankles. What it would be like if you didn’t have the brace.

20
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:33,880
-My left foot would be very dragging…

21
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:43,910
-In order to study this case, as the information comes in, you have to be looking in the

22
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:52,460
Repertory for every information that comes in. The fact that the disease starts from the

23
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:05,370
spasms in the larynx, it becomes peculiar and therefore we see through the Repertory,

24
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:11,370
which are the remedies which have an affinity with spasms in the larynx.

25
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:19,490
We go through there and we see Belladonna, Gelsemium, Ignatia, Moschus are mostly

26
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:25,320
and then Agaricus, Antimonium crudum, Arsenicum, Bromium, Chelidonium, Chloralum,

27
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:36,490
Coffea, Cuprum, Iodine, Lachesis, Manganum, Magnesia phosphorica, Opium,

28
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:42,660
Phosphorus, Sabucus, Silica, Tabacum, Tarentula and Veratrum.

29
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:55,910
From these remedies we get a first idea. The next thing we look is which of these remedies

30
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:21,680
have an affinity with the neuro-muscular system and they can cause paralysis and spasms

31
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:46,570
and we see that Agaricus, Gelsemium, Cuprum, Magnesia phosphorica, Lachesis…

32
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:58,360
You get an idea already of some remedies. The fact also that he says that the disease is

33
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:07,610
on the left side quite prominent, he speaks about the left side quite clearly.

34
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:20,360
This fact plus the fact that the whole thing started from the larynx and then we know that

35
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:36,660
Lachesis has these spasms in the larynx, so much so that sometimes from these spasms

36
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,660
they suffer quite a lot.

37
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:47,910
I make all this thinking now and out of all these remedies that I see through this Repertory,

38
00:06:50,760 --> 00:07:02,740
I prefer Lachesis at this stage. Already we have been given with the first symptoms some

39
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:14,240
information, which leads us towards Lachesis mostly.

40
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:25,070
With this thinking we continue to investigate without trying to influence the case in favor of

41
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:38,820
Lachesis or anything like that. Then you observe what else? In this case you also observe

42
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:47,600
something which is very obvious. What is that?

43
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,410
-He writes about his case.

44
00:07:53,510 --> 00:08:05,910
-Is that the obvious? The very obvious is the speech. What is the speech?

45
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:21,660
We have difficult…

46
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:40,240
It’s not stammering. Trembling, see unintelligible, Stramonium.

47
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:50,320
Most probably it means during stammering. Stramonium is one of the main remedies for

48
00:08:50,420 --> 00:09:06,740
stammering, especially if it is aggressive stammering, where the person really battles.

49
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,480
Let’s do some differential diagnosis also, so you learn something.

50
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:24,070
Stramonium really is a remedy which is an upheaval inside, tremendous energy inside that

51
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:30,230
can not come out and the energy is aggressive. Therefore the stammering also of this

52
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:36,490
person is not like that. It will never be like that.

53
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:47,990
This is a stammering you will see in which remedy?

54
00:09:48,090 --> 00:10:01,900
You see it in Mercury mostly. The Mercury is subdued and sweet stammering, it is not

55
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:13,750
aggressive, where the Causticum can talk like that but the moment he gets angry, it can

56
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:31,260
not come out. Then he talks normally and then he stucks when the emotions come.

57
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:45,800
With Stramonium is another thing, you really… You look and you say, my god how he

58
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:56,170
suffers to bring out the words.

59
00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:05,680
You see grimaces, that is a Stramonium. This is differential diagnosis just to one symptom.

60
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:18,680
So you get to know the nature of the remedy in this way.

61
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:29,920
He is not a Stramonium, he talks like that but why? Why he talks unintelligibly?

62
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:40,710
Because of his disease. The effect on the nervous system and the cerebellum and the

63
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:55,670
speech has been affected. Therefore we try to find the most close rubric that is to his case.

64
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:01,840
Difficult is the most close.

65
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,540
-Tremulous.

66
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:25,680
-It’s not tremulous. Let me see difficult speech.

67
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:34,110
The main remedies that appear in difficult speech are Belladonna, Crotalus, Gelsemium,

68
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:46,010
Lachesis, Natrum muriaticum, Opium, Stannum and Stramonium.

69
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:56,260
Here again in this rubric remedies have been mixed for different reasons.

70
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:08,920
Stannum has difficulty in talking, why? Because of exhaustion.

71
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:17,030
If you would say, I’m not well, this can be Stannum with exhaustion and not being able to

72
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:27,870
bring out, to talk, it can be Stannum. With Stramonium here the difficulty is because of the

73
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:35,810
tendency that the person has for stammering.

74
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:53,780
With Opium it is a speech that you hear in a kind of semi-coma state. It’s difficult,

75
00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:08,260
unintelligible, you don’t understand and then with Lachesis we have this thick talking, as

76
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:30,940
we call it. There is a difficulty in articulating, in pronouncing the words and the sounds.

77
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:42,350
Here we have a difficulty in speech, which brings to my mind again the idea of Lachesis.

78
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,780
We’ll see.

79
00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:05,020
-Since this time of weakness he has been a gradual strength loss of the left side and

80
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,680
worsening of the speech and swallowing, difficulty in swallowing.

81
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,590
-Difficulty in swallowing, when it started?

82
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:20,360
-One year ago.

83
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:43,680
-I have to tell you that when the spasm started, I became more careful with my eating,

84
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:59,360
smaller pieces, drinking slowly, so not to choke. I think it has stabilized up to a certain point.

85
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,220
-It stabilized to a certain point, it’s not continuing to get worse the swallowing.

86
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:15,600
-Maybe I can explain it. It seems to be that…I’ve seen other person and among them…

87
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:43,850
In my case I only seem to lose some power but I still have some left,

88
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:47,180
 the same thing with my neck and as far as my speech is concerned,

89
00:16:47,280 --> 00:17:06,390
 my speech has been not deteriorating  it is much more in these 6-7 months…

90
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:12,470
-Another area.

91
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:22,050
-Can everybody hear what he said?

92
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,470
 He says that he seems to get worse to a certain point and

93
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:31,640
that he was stabilized but then the weakness would start in different part of the body and

94
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:40,420
 that get worse for a while but he says comparing to other patients he is doing quite well.

95
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,760
-Yes.

96
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,130
-Because he still has some strength in arms and legs and speaking.

97
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,710
-Ask him how does he feel psychologically?

98
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:58,540
-I think more good things than bad things.

99
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,280
-Psychologically you feel happy?

100
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:12,790
-Not happy but it’s not as bad as I would have thought it would be.

101
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:23,040
-You remember the remark I made? Also you will see him he is not depressed at all.

102
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:33,330
He is optimistic, his disease is doing rather better and he is optimistic.

103
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:42,200
-He says he also notices a tendency to easily cry or laugh inappropriately. Like he will cry

104
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:48,120
very easily or laugh very easily but this is supposed to be typical for the disease.

105
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:55,740
-Take it, crying alternating with laughing.

106
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:10,800
We look at this and then we see another remedy, which is Mercury which could be a

107
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:29,890
possibility…alternating with laughter. Stramonium.

108
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:40,960
-He has some muscle wasting.

109
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:55,210
-He has the typical wasting of the feral muscle, you can see it.

110
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:06,400
-His sensory nervous system is OK, the nerves cells are degenerating in the spinal

111
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:33,550
column. That’s all. He had a bad accident in 1958 when he was 21 years old.

112
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:38,980
When he was 21 years old was an explosion on a boat and he was traumatized by this.

113
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,630
-Where?

114
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:50,120
-Mostly my leg.

115
00:20:50,220 --> 00:21:05,140
 I was in rehab center for 2 years, mostly pain.

116
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:21,790
 When it happened I didn’t have due to the explosion my muscle…

117
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:37,450
 to the bone and damaged this and it took for 4-5 days got me to a hospital and

118
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,540
 in those days I didn’t’ have…

119
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:55,450
-There was an explosion and the muscles and the bones and it took 2 years to recover

120
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:00,040
from mostly pain. You didn’t have any weakness after this accident?

121
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:11,620
-No and I did work very hard all my life.

122
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,950
-He has been well all his life?

123
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,570
-That’s what he says.

124
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:23,880
-He worked hard all his life.

125
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,550
-What was his profession? Sailor?

126
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:48,410
-Traffic manager, I had to work physically as well but I did work with my hands.

127
00:22:48,510 --> 00:23:05,620
-He worked with his hands and muscles all his life. Coaching, teaching sports and ski.

128
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,450
She says stress provokes headaches and difficulty in speech.

129
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:28,700
-So at this stage he gives some information about his disease. It is now very superficial, I

130
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:36,690
would say what we know about him. We do not know much about what took place.

131
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:46,110
What we know also is that such a disease can not be triggered unless there is an exciting

132
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:59,690
cause, unless there is a stimulation of the organism by some kind of stress.

133
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:10,780
What kind of stress took place in his life in order to manifest this severe disease, which

134
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:20,770
was in his DNA, it was genetically there but what triggered to come forth, to be

135
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,190
manifested?

136
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:37,770
My idea is that such a disease has to have quiet a strong stress mostly psychological.

137
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:52,190
Did he find himself especially in a situation where he was paralyzed by deciding this or

138
00:24:52,290 --> 00:25:01,270
that? That is a situation where it can paralyze somebody and the stress of not deciding

139
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:09,610
can bring about some kind of condition or did he have a series of antibiotics or did he have

140
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:24,610
a series of chemicals? Did he take drugs? Has he taken any narcotics? Any drugs?

141
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,280
Has he? Can anybody tell me?

142
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:32,700
-Yes.

143
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:56,440
-Not narcotics of that type. The persons who take recreational drugs, don’t speak, I do not

144
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,900
know, have I spoken to you before?

145
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,940
-No.

146
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:09,110
-I have an idea whether he took this kind of drugs or not. What do you think? I want you to

147
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:26,210
see your observation. Who says no? Who says yes? The no are in favor.

148
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:31,620
He had never taken these kind of drugs.

149
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:41,940
-Except from smoking cigarette. I don’t smoke anymore for 7 years.

150
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:56,110
-He could have taken LSD, in such situation, he could have taken sedatives like Tavor,

151
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:04,610
Valium and things like that could have brought about that kind of situation.

152
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,020
-What about alcohol?

153
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:12,100
-Does he taken alcohol just by observation? How much? He has taken alcohol, there is no

154
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:45,680
question. I mean a fair amount. This is not difficult to see because we see all his life.

155
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:59,430
This type of person will not take recreational drugs. Do you know why I say that?

156
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:08,690
Can anybody tell me why he has not taken LSD and cocaine and things like this?

157
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,800
-Hard working.

158
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,010
-Responsible job, proper?

159
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,470
-I don’t agree.

160
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,600
-Clear mind.

161
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:32,600
-Clear mind, you are closer to what I think. I think psychologically is quite healthy, down to

162
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:46,770
earth, a person who enjoyed, having a woman or two…Enjoy life in a natural way I would

163
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:56,800
say, so he would not need this extra stimulation which these drugs offer and that’s why I

164
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:13,350
say with certainty he has not taken but alcohol yes. Why? Because I see his color and

165
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:26,350
because every Canadian drinks.

166
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,930
-The French Canadian.

167
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,630
-Even worse.

168
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:42,850
Now we try to see what really happened and started this kind… and we go back to his

169
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:54,690
memory and I would like to ask him what has happened in his life 6 years ago?

170
00:29:54,790 --> 00:30:00,350
You cannot remember.

171
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:08,930
-The problem is that nobody is sure that it started at that time.

172
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:19,690
 10 years before, I’ve had things happened to me all my life, I was very lucky all my life.

173
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:25,520
-You are married?

174
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,050
-Yes, twice.

175
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:34,360
-You have children?

176
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:52,290
-I have two grown up girls that are married and a young son 8 years old.

177
00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:01,220
It was a very happy thing.

178
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:12,180
-I want to ask you something else. Why did you divorce your first wife? Because you had

179
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,600
found already the second one?

180
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:25,470
-No. I found the second one 15 years later. You have to understand that at the time of the

181
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:41,150
divorce I was working 18 months in South America, 8 months …

182
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,220
-As a sailor?

183
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:49,130
-No, as traffic port manager.

184
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:56,760
-But travelling on a ship from port to port?

185
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:03,810
-No, I travelled by plane for 6-7 months, then go to another place and the first wife got

186
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:15,050
very tired to that and she found someone else.

187
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:34,060
-He says, he may have had other girlfriends as well before the divorce.

188
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,370
-He might have.

189
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,880
-They are still friends.

190
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:53,540
-With his wife, the first one.

191
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,850
-When did he marry the second wife?

192
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,350
-14 years ago.

193
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,310
-And the son was born 9 years ago?

194
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:09,520
-Yes.

195
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:15,680
-Which means for three and a half years you did not have a child?

196
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:26,940
-Four or five years, we wanted to have one but god wanted us to wait again.

197
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:34,090
-I see. Now are you still married with your second wife?

198
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:44,850
-Yes.

199
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:56,590
-During that time after your son was born, there was no problems between you and your

200
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,270
wife?

201
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:11,930
-No problems for sure. The only thing that happened around that time, I’ll be very frank

202
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,840
with you was a very happy thing. I won …

203
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:24,930
-He won a quarter of a million dollars in a lottery.

204
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:41,680
-That’s a big stress if you don’t expect it.

205
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:51,350
We would like to know a difficult question now. Now the questions start to be a bit difficult,

206
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:52,790
it’s OK.

207
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,930
-I’ll do my best.

208
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:04,770
-We would like to know , whether when you had these contacts in different ports with some

209
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:14,550
women, did you ever have any venereal disease?

210
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:33,390
-Yes. I can tell you, no and on top of that… and the disease has never…

211
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:38,220
-He says most of the places he was belonged to the second parallel and this disease that

212
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,660
he has now has not been not diagnosed in that parallel.

213
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,550
-Beside multiple sclerosis.

214
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:53,000
-He is asking if you ever had gonorrhea, syphilis.

215
00:35:53,100 --> 00:36:05,070
-No, I had to treat people because I was taking care of the crew and I never had.

216
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,740
-Did you get antibiotics for something?

217
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:26,300
-I had penicillin for operation, I’m sure they gave me antibiotics.

218
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,350
-He thinks he may had antibiotics when he had his gall bladder operation.

219
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:36,600
-Are you sure you did not have any venereal disease? Urithritis?

220
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,590
-Pain in urination.

221
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:51,290
-No, I’m very lucky but no, never.

222
00:36:54,340 --> 00:37:16,960
-I’m saying that in those days venereal disease was not as frequent as they are today.

223
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:29,290
-30 years ago things were quite different I think.

224
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:35,540
-His father to what age he lived?

225
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:41,960
-My father died 82 years old.

226
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,700
-From what? From old age.

227
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:55,050
-He had been suffering from hardening of the arteries and he had an operation and didn’t

228
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,300
survive.

229
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,540
-His mother?

230
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,330
-My mother died 43 years old.

231
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,540
-From what?

232
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:22,220
-I believe from lung cancer or some kind of cancer.

233
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:31,130
You have to understand I was not raised by my parents, I was an orphan.

234
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:36,710
-So he was not raised by his parents, he was an orphan. He does not know his parents.

235
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:45,200
-I know my mother until 8 years old, then I was raised into an orphanage. I never lived with

236
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:50,970
my own father.

237
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:56,460
-Your real mother do you know how old she lived for?

238
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:05,810
-It’s the same mother.

239
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:33,960
-When did he win the lotto, how many years ago?

240
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:49,710
-It was about 1986, about the same time, it started 2 months after.

241
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:55,040
-Two months after winning the lottery, he started getting some symptoms.

242
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:16,120
-About the same time. The main thing is 6-7 years is that they found out that I had this

243
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:31,710
spasm, so this is a symptom of the disease. Maybe cancer, maybe other things happening

244
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:37,050
that I did not notice.

245
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:56,040
-Before that, did you ever wake up in the night thinking that your larynx is closed and you

246
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:05,490
can not breathe?  During sleep did you ever wake up, as if you could not breathe?

247
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:13,990
-No, but this is started to happen with the disease, I was choking in my sleep because of

248
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:22,960
the spasm. Never before, it started in 1986.

249
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,540
-And it was happening during your sleep?

250
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,380
-Always.

251
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,420
-Yes.

252
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:42,050
-Maybe you are getting somewhere.

253
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:54,790
-You see his face how it is litted up, he says this man he understands, he starts to believe

254
00:41:54,890 --> 00:42:05,880
that I understand things. He says how did he get that? You see the reaction?

255
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,290
Therefore the symptom is reliable.

256
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:18,280
What he says, you have to take into consideration seriously because you know very well

257
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:28,450
the action of Lachesis on the pneumogastric nerve when it is paralyzed and there is a kind

258
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,790
of spasm on falling asleep or during sleep where

259
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:41,260
 he wakes up in fright thinking that he will choke.

260
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:58,650
What else do you observe?

261
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:16,740
I observe that most of the Canadians are dressed like me, with a tie and I see that he

262
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:22,240
wears no tie and I would like to know why?

263
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:28,740
-Lachesis.

264
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,740
-Why you do not wear a tie? Because you do not like to be tight here or because you do

265
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:43,730
not like the tie or you do not have a tie? What is the reason for not wearing a tie?

266
00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:52,990
-I have all kinds of suit but I don’t wear them. This is me.

267
00:43:53,090 --> 00:44:01,990
-That’s you, you do not like to wear a tie. If you wear a tie, you will feel restricted?

268
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:04,740
-No, I do not bother.

269
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:17,740
-You could wear a tie and feel comfortable but out of belief, you believe that it is better to

270
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,990
not wear a tie, is that correct?

271
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:23,000
-I believe this is better.

272
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,740
-Simpler.

273
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:33,740
-This is terrible.

274
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,080
-He says he doesn’t bother him to wear a tie.

275
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:47,320
-Yes I know. So he says he doesn’t bother but he does not. You never wear a tie?

276
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:56,830
-Yes I do. I have to, for my work sometimes, I have to go to see the banker or my boss or

277
00:44:56,930 --> 00:45:09,320
to see the accountant. So from respect to him I have to…

278
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:16,150
-When you wear a tie, you want it loose or tight?

279
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:22,410
-As you can see it’s very tight.

280
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:25,900
-No, this collar is not tight but…

281
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:40,240
-This is the kind of shirt I would wear. If I may say when I do wear tie, it’s a tie from all the

282
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:45,580
way through.

283
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:52,440
-Can you imagine now what he is thinking when he has such a serious disease talking

284
00:45:52,540 --> 00:46:02,570
about a tie with him? He says, strange questions these people are putting to me.

285
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:17,080
Strange people. Still he is not in a position to think. After all this is finished, then he will

286
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,570
start thinking.

287
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:22,660
-No, I’m thinking.

288
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,400
-You are thinking already.

289
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,990
-I was before I came here.

290
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:36,740
-Very good.

291
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:44,990
Something else I want to know.

292
00:46:45,090 --> 00:47:01,240
Before your disease in relation with your wives, girlfriends you were jealous sometimes?

293
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:12,360
-No. I couldn’t care less. I’m not possessive of anyone.

294
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:17,160
-He is not possessive of anybody.

295
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:22,160
-You are not possessive out of character or out of philosophical belief?

296
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:38,660
-I guess out of character. I never care about these things.

297
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,940
-He says he is not very materialistic, he doesn’t care about his house, his car, he is not

298
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,520
very attached to material things.

299
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:51,770
-I like to work 7 days the week. This is what I like.

300
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:55,580
-He likes to work 7 days the week.

301
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:04,410
-I still do. I still do.

302
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:09,490
-The women were jealous with him?

303
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:16,990
-I don’t think so. I can’t talk for them.

304
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:24,320
-He can’t talk for them but he doesn’t think so.

305
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:33,020
-In company with other people you are loquacious, talking, participating or rather reserve

306
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,360
and quiet?

307
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:46,610
-I have no problem socializing but I’m not very great talker. I love people but I don’t...

308
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:54,110
-He loves to be with people and he seems to be OK in conversation. He says he is not a

309
00:48:54,210 --> 00:49:00,850
great socialiser.

310
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:06,850
-I don’t have too many friends, 3 or 4 real friends.

311
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:14,520
-How much alcohol do you take?

312
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:24,020
-We are talking now or before? I never was a heavy drinker but I had a couple of beers,

313
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:47,560
first of all only Heineken, nothing else and maybe a scotch or two…

314
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:51,610
-You had two drinks every day?

315
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:55,860
-No, one beer.

316
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,190
-One drink per day?

317
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:02,190
-Sometimes none.

318
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:08,440
-Did you go through a period where you were heavy drinker?

319
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:34,200
-I had to tell that since 1974 I have not taken a day off, I’ve been working 7 days the week..

320
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:45,690
-Since 1974 he works 7 days the week, so he doesn’t see how he can be drinking very much.

321
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:57,770
-Maybe I take a few days here and there.

322
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:03,780
-Does he have any pains, any cramps?

323
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:11,020
-They happen sometimes in my leg, while I sleep only, never during the day, when I sleep

324
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:24,020
yes and in my left thumb if I have to put a bit more strength my fingers I have to bring them

325
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,360
back.

326
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:32,310
-He gets some cramp in the hands when he has to do something with strength.

327
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:42,720
-But in the legs it’s only in the night, I wake up with a terrible cramp.

328
00:51:42,820 --> 00:52:03,110
-So to resume the case until now, we have symptomatology of Lachesis, on the physical

329
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:16,350
level. In his pathology we can not confirm Lachesis. He denies he is bothered by tight

330
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:24,360
collars, he denies having any kind of jealousy and …

331
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:40,450
He denies to be loquacious, so the constitutional symptoms of Lachesis are not there.

332
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:50,190
But the last thing he says is that I have cramps during the night, this for those who may

333
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:57,270
know Lachesis, is a Lachesis symptom because Lachesis suffers mostly in the night and

334
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:06,610
mostly in the first part of the night and when he wakes up in the morning.

335
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:13,190
Lachesis wakes up in a bad mood and you ask him, how do you wake up in the morning,

336
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:17,280
how do you feel in the morning?

337
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:22,520
-I feel great.

338
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:28,030
-Very good. That’s what we want to hear.

339
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:33,720
-Now I feel even better because I’m glad to be alive.

340
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:39,860
-He is glad to be alive so he feels very good.

341
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:48,310
-I never had any problem in waking up in the morning.

342
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:50,810
-You wake up and immediately you can jump out of bed.

343
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:53,150
-Now?

344
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:57,950
-Yes sure but before always?

345
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:06,780
-Yes I never had any problem whatsoever.

346
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:13,020
-In what position do you sleep?

347
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,770
-On my right side.

348
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:20,780
-Always, all your life on your right side?

349
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:30,640
-Yes he will have to say yes, most of his life.

350
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:37,940
-I don’t feel OK on the left side.

351
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:44,200
-What bothers you?

352
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:50,700
-I haven’t noticed. I can’t.

353
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:56,200
-Yes but you feel something if you lie on the left side, do you remember?

354
00:54:56,300 --> 00:55:03,190
-No, I can’t feel relaxed.

355
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:09,030
-He can’t let himself go into sleep.

356
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:21,440
-Maybe it is something that I made up myself.

357
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:30,690
-He is quite a gentle person. He likes people being affectionate with him and close to him.

358
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:31,190
-Of course, who doesn’t?

359
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:43,510
-He likes people being affectionate and close to him.

360
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,020
-How do you know?

361
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,770
-I sit here, I can tell. Is that right?

362
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:57,260
-I came with you.

363
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:22,350
-How would you describe your psychological state?

364
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:34,530
-I tell you quite frank, I’m even surprised myself how I reacted to this. If someone would

365
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:45,500
ask me that question 2 years ago, I would be upset and shooting myself right there on the

366
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,990
spot but now…

367
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:53,240
-It’s even better than before psychologically?

368
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:58,580
-I would say yes because I’m functioning well.

369
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:04,670
-Psychologically and mentally. You see?

370
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:13,910
When the disease has somatised totally the mental-emotional level is left free and he is

371
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:22,940
more happy and more optimistic and he is able to cope with his disease much better.

372
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:28,940
If somebody would tell me 2 years ago in what state I would have been, I would think I

373
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:44,190
would shoot myself but now I can tolerate and I believe he is quite happy.

374
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,450
That’s it.

375
00:57:52,960 --> 00:58:02,410
The fact that he sleeps on the right side, does it mean anything to you?

376
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:07,160
To whom it means something? Let me see the hands.

377
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:17,160
To the others it doesn’t mean anything?

378
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:46,070
All his life he says. In the left side he feels something which does not let him relax and go

379
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:52,080
to sleep. He cannot give an explanation why.

380
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:13,410
Cramps in the night in bed, can you show me this rubric?

381
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:31,700
-Calves and the foot.

382
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:40,240
-Sulphur, Calcarea, Lycopodium, where is Causticum?

383
00:59:40,340 --> 01:00:03,190
-I was a very happy man and got very lucky.

384
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:27,170
-He says he may have got gonorrhea even though he didn’t have any symptoms.

385
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:39,460
He may have been a carrier but may not have had it or whatever.

386
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,430
-Is that possible?

387
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:58,080
-We are searching for this cause especially with syphilis where this symptomatology is

388
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:17,240
similar to the third stage of syphilis, where we have the tabes dorsalis  which is neuromuscular manifestation of syphilis.

389
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:26,460
Definitely in order to get to that stage, you have to get the primary and then the secondary

390
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:38,010
and then you may have to go into that state. This is lacking from his history which means

391
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:50,660
that genetically there is a predisposition for the disease which appears after great stress or

392
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,190
excitement perhaps.

393
01:01:54,290 --> 01:02:06,940
Perhaps the fact that he was over enjoyed with the lotto, winning the lottery, it acted as a

394
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:15,190
catalyser or trigger for his pathology.

395
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:23,410
-He said it was 2 months before.

396
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:41,450
-The symptoms of your disease came 2 months after winning the lotto?

397
01:02:41,550 --> 01:03:04,190
-I think so, it came about the same time.

398
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,410
-He said after.

399
01:03:13,130 --> 01:03:25,130
-Was any pressure on you for the money to give it to somebody or to do certain things?

400
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:34,780
-I haven’t done anything with that. There was no pressure. I didn’t need the money.

401
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,530
-You did not need the money.

402
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:39,030
-You still have it?

403
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:49,520
-I haven’t spent anything.

404
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:58,120
-How did you feel when you won the lottery?

405
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:10,610
-Nothing. I was very happy but nothing ever changed.

406
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:16,690
-Do you remember that maybe the first night you did not sleep the whole night or things

407
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:17,890
like that?

408
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:29,890
-No, I slept very well.

409
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:45,610
-Do you have any possibility in your work to be poisoned by any metal, especially lead?

410
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:58,270
-Yes, there was at one point quite a few years back and as a matter of fact…

411
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:14,080
Apparently in the… where I did my military service there have been 4-5 cases of people

412
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:28,830
who were on the same sub-marine. It was a British sub-marine from the world war two.

413
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:37,080
-He was in a sub-marine in a study concerning the…

414
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:48,220
-4-5 cases of people in the Canadian navy who came with the disease…

415
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:55,990
-4-5 cases with the disease of people who worked on the same sub-marine.

416
01:05:56,090 --> 01:06:11,140
Probably you were exposed to. There was a lot of fuels, diesel fuels?

417
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,000
-Yes, of course.

418
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:17,640
-Diesel is full of a lot of toxic metals, it’s very toxic.

419
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:24,140
-This is why they put us …

420
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:33,640
-On the same sub-marine. They were only two sub-marines of that kind but nothing really

421
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:38,380
came out of it.

422
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:54,650
-There was only two. There was some exposure to diesel fuels over a long period of time.

423
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:57,140
How long?

424
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:01,390
-I served in that sub-marine for 8 months.

425
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:04,390
-What year?

426
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:14,390
-I believe it’s 1961. I will have to check.

427
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:18,390
-That’s OK.

428
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:21,140
-Did you get weakness when you were there on that sub-marine?

429
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:27,340
-I never had any problem.

430
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:33,810
-Was any major shock or fear or fright?

431
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:42,140
-Sure, when the ship blew up I didn’t have … but when I woke up I feel all the pain.

432
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:47,220
I’m sure it was all kind of stress.

433
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:51,140
-Later on did you have any shock, like fear…?

434
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,590
-The shock came about 4 months later.

435
01:07:53,690 --> 01:08:02,890
-4 months later after the explosion.

436
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:19,140
-… into another ship and because of the… I couldn’t work for the first year…

437
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:31,380
-It was a shock when they told him he will never walk again. You got over the shock?

438
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,390
-Obviously.

439
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:48,140
-There was a shock when he was in an explosion 21 years old and it took him 4 months

440
01:08:48,240 --> 01:09:01,730
to feel emotionally the shock, to realize that he may not walk again.
