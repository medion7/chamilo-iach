1
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:34,810
-OK, this is case on which we had prescribed Picric acid D6 for 1 week,

2
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,210
D7 for another week and D8 for the third week.

3
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:45,940
So for 3 weeks you took the potency of Picric acid

4
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:53,200
and that was on May and you started…?

5
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,440
-I started 1 month ago.

6
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,300
-You started in August?

7
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:13,130
-22nd August but I was supposed to take it for 2 months and go up.

8
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,030
-Tell us what happened.

9
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:26,530
-I started right away with an aggravation 7 hours later, with stitches in left sacrum

10
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:38,280
and it was for some hours and went away. After the first day I was chilly

11
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:50,160
even if it was very warm weather, so it was getting freezing and the feet were very cold.

12
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:55,010
They are always very cold but they were especially cold.

13
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:02,900
And I wanted warm creams some soups, I felt tired and bad as if a flu was coming on

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,920
and a pain in the throat.

15
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:18,570
The second day I was feeling feverish but also easily chilled even thought the skin was warm.

16
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:29,570
I felt chilled inside. Still I wanted to swim in the sea because I felt it was very good.

17
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,820
I enjoyed the swimming.

18
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,500
-In Norway?
-Yes it was a very warm summer.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,870
So the seaside generally makes me feel very much better but right now I’ m very cold

20
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:57,540
so I have not been swimming. Only once.

21
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,710
-But you stay under the sun?

22
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:09,810
-Yes I like the sun and I wanted to warm so I was wandering.

23
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:20,210
And a feeling of weakness not really well started up the second day

24
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:29,450
and the third day was about the same but when I brushed my teeth the second day,

25
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:41,950
I started bleeding in the gums and very painful ulcers in the gums and I could hardly eat

26
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,310
and also some blood in my nose, a little bit.

27
00:03:53,490 --> 00:04:05,490
It was like a burning and smarting and very hard to eat and a feeling of paper in my mouth.

28
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,640
-And the ulcers how long they lasted?

29
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,490
-A couple of days, 3-4 days.

30
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:39,390
But the weakness, I felt very tired and very strong headaches for some hours in occiput

31
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:47,640
in the base and muscle was very weak so I felt I could hardly stand, I felt weak and exhausted,

32
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,740
I hardly could stand on my feet.

33
00:04:51,990 --> 00:05:00,640
And the aching and sore in the whole body, and they left me, I got back some pain,

34
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,570
I had comes and goes, and it was hard working, stitching pains.

35
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:18,570
And the problems with the gums got worse and also the headache and I got more thirsty.

36
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:30,970
Then it went into the lungs similar as the process when I took Phosphorus last time.

37
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,720
-It went down to the lungs the cold and then you started coughing?

38
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:46,210
-No, I don’t think I started coughing but a couple of days later but the burning pain

39
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:56,720
in the lungs and also dyspnea, breathing problems and burning pain in the chest

40
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:11,310
and all the back and behind sternum. And also I started to get some pain in the kidneys.

41
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:26,220
I had pyelonephritis many years ago and it was a little similar like the beginning

42
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,810
of getting into that.

43
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,800
-How many years ago you had the pyelonephritis?

44
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,650
-I was about 20, 20 years ago.

45
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,300
When I was breathing it was stitching up in the occiput and up to the right arm,

46
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,400
like pain extending up.

47
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:09,400
And I was very exhausted in the evening and asthmatic problem, hard to breathe.

48
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:18,900
So then a friend called and after a short while I had to tell her I could not talk anymore

49
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:33,000
because I didn’t have strength to speak and she could hear the whizzing sound from the phone.

50
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:43,430
-So she gave you another remedy?
-No.

51
00:07:49,230 --> 00:08:05,480
I felt the fever was increasing though when I tested it was only 36.5, if it’s correct.

52
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,730
-But you felt that you had fever.

53
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:18,730
-But I never get fever, it feels I can not work out the fever.

54
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:33,990
And the feeling of intoxicated and that my head was not functioning was aggravated...

55
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,230
-It was strong.

56
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:48,730
-My head was just like cotton and I went into apathy and a trans-like state

57
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,560
and the appetite diminished very soon after taking the remedy.

58
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,560
-You took 3 times the day or once the day?
-Twice the day.

59
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:14,450
And the lung problems got worse, so I felt I was worried about pneumonia,

60
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:22,950
so in the fifth day I just not to take any remedy.

61
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:24,670
-You did not take.
-No.

62
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:32,570
So I called her and described the symptoms and 2 days later I got a fax

63
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:40,540
and you told me to continue because you saw that symptoms were like common cold.

64
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,590
-Yes.

65
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:48,950
-But I felt it was getting worse after talking with she, so a couple of days I didn’t take any.

66
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,140
-You didn’t take any remedy.

67
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:03,540
-I got better when I did not take the remedy, those days I felt a little better.

68
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:23,540
I had some shooting pains up in the vagina and uterus and the right ovary

69
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,750
but I had eaten an apple so I don’t know if it was something to do with it

70
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,790
or it was to do with the remedy.

71
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:42,970
But dyspnea continued and it was much more the cold that was getting a little better

72
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:48,190
while not taking the remedy and the lung problem was also a little better.

73
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,990
I can not remember so I have to…

74
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:18,040
-These notes you wrote afterwards?
-I wrote day by day.

75
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:27,520
Otherwise no chance and I had a book with me, I just took out big parts.

76
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,620
-All right.

77
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:41,440
-I think I was very tired but I was a little better day by day but then I felt better,

78
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,870
then I started again with this, after a couple of days.

79
00:11:47,370 --> 00:12:01,020
So it was only 2 days I didn’t take the remedy and after taking this 7

80
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,520
I got much pain in my neck and the occiput which I also had before that

81
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,960
I had to lie down for several hours.

82
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,800
-Because of the pain?

83
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:22,520
-Yes and then the flu symptoms started again when I started with this 7.

84
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,520
It had been better a little bit and then it comes again.

85
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,050
-It came again?

86
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:39,600
-Yes and the pain in the kidneys came again but worse and also some burning pains in my stomach

87
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:52,630
like it was too much acid, similar to the burning pains I hadn’t long seen.

88
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:59,880
I felt also very dizzy and when I got up I thought the blood pressure was very low

89
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,230
and I had to get up very slowly.

90
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,130
-Otherwise you felt you may faint?

91
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:16,040
-Yes and the influenza symptoms increased and I got back to the difficulty to think again

92
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,890
and the dyspnea got worse.

93
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,880
-Again the dyspnea got worse, the same thing?

94
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:33,810
-Yes the same thing with the slightest exertion, I had breathing problems.

95
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:49,710
Also I was nauseous. And I was freezing cold, I just wanted warm clothes to lie down

96
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:58,560
into the carpet and aching in the bones and then the depression started.

97
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:22,470
I got more and more depressed, no energy, no appetite and I went to D8 next week and

98
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,460
the 2 days before I had been a little better with the cold

99
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,710
and then it came increasingly with the D8.

100
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,960
-The cold?

101
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:41,220
-And the flu and I got a lot of mucus out from the nose and a lot of clear water

102
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,320
and a lot of lacrimation, I could hardly go outside, I was so photophobic.

103
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,320
-The lacrimation was so much?
-Yes and I was so sensitive to the light.

104
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:04,560
And then I had a lot of abdominal pain and distended and a lot of gas.

105
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,560
-The pains in the kidneys came for the third time?

106
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:29,460
-I don’t remember. It was like coming and going, when I was coughing and

107
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:38,640
if I was a little bit cold it was more pain in the lungs and also extended down in the …

108
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:52,890
and the sinusitis and congestion in the head, in the whole area.

109
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,810
And I got really long period of sneezing and sneezing and sneezing

110
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,640
and I normally don’t too much.

111
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,900
-Do you feel dryness in the mouth?
-Yes because I’m nervous.

112
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,960
It was hard to breathe all the time through the bigger remedy

113
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:29,890
because the dyspnea was there all the time and breathing it was painful.

114
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,390
-And burning?
-Yes burning pain.

115
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:52,880
The kidney problems started again. And the feeling of no energy

116
00:16:52,980 --> 00:17:04,590
but worse I got depressed and I got into … I felt apathy and hopelessness and worthless

117
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,920
and no self-confidence and all these things that are normally…

118
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:18,770
it was very much increased. And it was hard to walk.

119
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:24,770
-Because of the dyspnea?
-No, no energy.

120
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:32,530
And the muscles felt so weak, it was hard to stand on feet .

121
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:42,220
I went a couple of meters, I had to sit down and I was sitting and lying down most of the day

122
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:50,190
and some suicidal thoughts came back, a lot of apathy.

123
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:14,690
I didn’t want to live, I was very much back into that. So I stopped the remedy there.

124
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:25,520
-So you took the remedy 1 more week?
-No, I had the D8 for 1 week.

125
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,670
-And then you stopped?

126
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:34,670
-Yes, when I was so much into this suicidal thing.

127
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:40,090
-And then what you felt, how you feel now? How long is since you stop the medication?

128
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:49,670
-September 12 I stopped the medication and I was also thinking of being able to come here

129
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:57,420
and in that condition I couldn’t have manage, so I slowly got better

130
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:05,760
and my appetite increased immediately and the cold was getting better but I was coughing a lot.

131
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:20,140
A dry cough and almost like throwing up and some itching started everywhere.

132
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,870
But the fever kept on for a while.

133
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:32,030
-Fever as feeling, not real fever?

134
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:39,870
-I didn’t check it again, I was exhausted, no energy, no strength but from the 4th day

135
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:52,220
after I stopped, I started getting better and I also have been getting better since I came here.

136
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:05,870
-I wanted to tell me how you feel mentally because that was the main problem, the concentration.

137
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,120
-Mentally I don’t think it has changed much.

138
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:18,120
-It hasn’t change. So you are having the same problems of concentration,

139
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:25,120
confusion in the mind or you have forgotten perhaps?

140
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:36,720
-No, I do feel better in some ways because before I started the remedy I went on for 9 days

141
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:43,970
of fasting and changing my diet and I’ve done that many times and I always feel calmer,

142
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,470
feel better, not so intoxicated.

143
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,970
-Before starting with the remedies?

144
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:54,470
-Yes, so I did that and finished before I start.

145
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:10,830
So when I do not eat a certain kind of food I feel more clear, more alert, not so intoxicated.

146
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:19,890
-But you said that after starting the remedy, you did not eat because you lost your appetite.

147
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,400
-Yes, I ate much less.

148
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:30,800
-So why didn’t you feel better during taking the remedy if you were eating less?

149
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:42,290
-I felt the same as after fasting, that part did not change starting the remedy,

150
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:52,790
it went physical, but it came with the flu I guess the feeling of emptiness in the head,

151
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,930
maybe I don’t know.

152
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:24,380
-What you are saying now is that you had a reaction with the remedy, all this flu type reaction

153
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:32,430
but your mind was not affected during all this period, before the remedy or after the remedy.

154
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:47,540
-No I felt I started clearing immediately after I changed the diet and that was before and I kept…

155
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,290
-But this clearance of the mind continued or no?

156
00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:06,120
-It was not much of it but I had this change with the flu, some days better, some days worse.

157
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,880
-How is your concentration now, here?

158
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:19,980
-I can concentrate, not always but the forgetfulness is the same.

159
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:31,800
I have to work myself up, I recognize very much the Causticum case

160
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:37,300
because it is difficult to put words to it if you are like this all the time

161
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:46,300
but when you said about to let yourself able to relax, I felt this is just how I feel

162
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:53,630
because if I do that I get empty. I have to get adrenaline going.

163
00:23:53,730 --> 00:24:02,960
I have to push myself to be alert and I do this a lot when I’m here, if I let myself relaxed

164
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:08,810
I go off in a dreamy state. So push, push, push.

165
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:16,210
-It seems that there is a kind of redness in the face and in the neck.

166
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,710
-Excitement.

167
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:22,460
-You did not have that last time.
-I’m nervous.

168
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,810
-Because you are nervous?
-I think so.

169
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:35,810
-But last time you were more nervous.
-Yes, maybe.

170
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:46,400
-This redness you did not know about?
-Sure, it comes fast.

171
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:54,820
-When you are under stress or under emotional pressure?

172
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:01,070
-Yes, if I have to hurry, I feel always in a hurry, if I’m late or if the time passes too quickly

173
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:12,160
and I don’t have enough time, I always … and if I feel these feelings I get all flash.

174
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:18,810
-Then this flashing goes away or it stays?
-It can stay for a while.

175
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:28,160
-How long? Days or hours?
-Not days, hours yes and I’m also very warm.

176
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,810
-So your cheeks are warm now? You feel them warm?

177
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,410
-Yes, very.

178
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:55,410
-Difficult. Do you want to say something else?

179
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:13,900
-I feel a lot of strain with being always late and I feel I can not keep things in order.

180
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,330
Everything is a mess.

181
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,580
-In your house?
-Yes and everything.

182
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,250
-What else you want to say?

183
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Let me ask you something, do you eat fruits?

184
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:51,750
-A little bit but I don’t like it so much as before and I don’t tolerate it so much either.

185
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,150
-You have a diarrhea if you eat fruits?

186
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:07,650
-Sometimes yes and as if not digested properly and also a feeling of emptiness

187
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,990
and hungry after fruits.

188
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:24,410
-But do you avoid fruits, do you go and buy fruits or you never buy fruits?

189
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,500
-Sometimes, a little.

190
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:35,660
-What? Apples?
-Peaches mostly and pineapple juice.

191
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:43,410
-What is your diet, what you are eating mostly?

192
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:55,400
-I have some fish and try to avoid sugar and coffee and tea,

193
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:09,500
I can not have tea without palpitation and the pulses strong.

194
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:18,330
Also after a lot of food I get a lot of adrenaline and I get the same flashes, I’m warm,

195
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:34,680
stitching and sweat like needles after coffee and tea and also farinaceous food.

196
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:44,740
So I try to avoid these things and also sugar and bread, yeast.

197
00:28:44,840 --> 00:29:03,600
-Mostly what do you eat?
-Mostly vegetables and some soya beans.

198
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:05,240
-Are you vegetarian?

199
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:13,080
-No, I have some fish but not meat anymore, no eggs, no milk but I have feta cheese

200
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:18,430
and it’s not so good. I have some diarrhea from having milk products.

201
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:26,510
-Sugar will give you palpitations?
-Yes.

202
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,410
-Do you perspire at all?
-I perspire very easily.

203
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:42,170
-Where is the first place that you perspire?

204
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:47,910
-The hands, even if it’s very cold I have to take off immediately when I’m out walking

205
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:56,260
and head, I can not cover head.

206
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:04,410
I have to take it off very fast in the winter. I freeze, I’m usually very cold

207
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:11,260
but the head I don’t want warm, I want to be warm in other places.

208
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,260
I feel very easily congested in the head.

209
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,550
-Do you have any fears?

210
00:30:50,510 --> 00:31:01,230
-For this interview but not really fears, I don’t like to watch down from a high place,

211
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:14,270
I don’t like to get there, I get the feeling of being drawn towards jump, so I have to stay back

212
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:27,770
but still I would like to jump from an airplane with this parachute but fears I have to think.

213
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,010
-Fear of dark?
–No.

214
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,860
-Fear of thunderstorm?
–No, I love it.

215
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,350
-Which is the best time for you?
-In the night.

216
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:48,110
-Up to what time, up to 10 o’clock or you can stay up to 2 o’clock.

217
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,440
-I hardly never go to bed before 3 o’clock.

218
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:59,840
-And what are you doing from 10 o’clock onwards, you are out with friends

219
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,190
or you are in your house studying?

220
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:12,090
-I’m mostly staying at home but I can go out in the dark for a walk and meditate,

221
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,940
look at the stars, even if it’s very dark.

222
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:19,590
-And you feel good in the night?

223
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:29,340
-Yes, when the sun sets I feel my eyes open and when there is no so strong light

224
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:37,440
I can see more clearly the objects, I start to wake up.

225
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,840
-Is this the time that you would like to study mostly?

226
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:55,890
-Yes, I can not even try, before. I sit home and try to study before 7,8,9 o’clock.

227
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,760
-How is your sleep? You sleep right through the night?

228
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:16,610
-No, I wake up all the time and many times I have to go to the bathroom.

229
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:24,270
It was a little bit better, I got up less during the remedy.

230
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:34,420
-Do you have normal bowel motion once the day or you have to go several times?

231
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:43,260
-I used to have a lot of diarrhea but it went better lately. So I had to go a lot but now…

232
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,760
-So now in the night when you have to go to bathroom is for urination?

233
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,110
-Yes.

234
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:59,700
-And you drink quite a lot finally of water?
-Yes, after Phos I drink quite a lot.

235
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,090
-This is the way that you drink all the time, just one sip?

236
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:23,940
-No, I can drink more but not large, not big and not too cold. Then I get freezing inside.

237
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,520
-Fear of death?

238
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:43,920
-Not so much but I told you last time after an incident, I got some fear

239
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:53,600
because I experienced a kind of black out because I was suggested to go out of my body

240
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,440
and I could not control, I could not come back and after that I got some fear.

241
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:03,540
-Do you have another experience out of your body during this time?

242
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:09,440
-This time, lately no. I feel more centered.

243
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,920
-How you sleep, what position you take to sleep?

244
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:29,270
-Left side, no right side.

245
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:34,770
-And towards the abdomen?
-Yes.

246
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:54,020
-Do you see dreams? What kind of dreams?
-Yes, flying.

247
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:02,210
-Do you ever see that you fall while flying, you fall down suddenly, you jerk?

248
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:03,310
-No.

249
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,810
-Flying.

250
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,920
-But not so much, it has been a couple of dreams lately with flying

251
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:17,020
and also I had before but it’s not that I had a lot lately.

252
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:31,900
-There is any other pattern of dreams like water, like swimming, lots of water…

253
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,250
-I have dreams with water but there are a lot different things.

254
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,250
-Your dreams are vivid, you remember them?
-Yes.

255
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:55,990
-During this period did you have a relationship?

256
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,090
-Since last time no.

257
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:08,900
-You are still alone in the house, living alone?
-Yes.

258
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,840
-And you cook for yourself or you eat outside?
-No, I cook for myself.

259
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:46,900
-You remember you have said you had condylomata. What happened with these condylomata,

260
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I can’t remember, can you remind me?

261
00:37:49,750 --> 00:38:04,150
-It was almost 20 years ago and it was put something on that was burning it away

262
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,400
and they went away.

263
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,250
-And they never came back?
-They never came back.

264
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,900
-Did you have any warts on your fingers as a child?

265
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,250
-I don’t think I had.

266
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:39,240
But I have like small ... like often people have in the eyelids… in some places I get

267
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:58,590
and I have some warts like. And I seem to get a lot of spots.

268
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,920
-You feel more calm now?
-Yes.

269
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,300
-What you were afraid mostly when you came?

270
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:27,140
-Not to remember. It’s embarrassing not to remember.

271
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:51,290
-Do you have any feelings by the time of sunset, special sadness or anxiety

272
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,710
when the sun goes down?

273
00:39:53,810 --> 00:40:01,560
-It can be both, suddenly melancholic or suddenly very accelerated, things changing fast.

274
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:09,660
-Would you say that your inner condition, the moods are easily changing?

275
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:17,560
-Yes, very. I can laugh and cry the next second.

276
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:46,960
But I feel that my main problem is the feeling of no self-confidence and worthlessness

277
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:54,090
I feel that this is kind of blocking me with going on with things.

278
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:06,540
-This feeling has come because of what? What do you think?

279
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,470
Because of your mother of how your parents treated you?

280
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:20,560
-Yes, because I felt very strongly I was not welcome to the world.

281
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,990
-The world did not want you?
-No, my parents.

282
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:29,430
-Your parents did not want you

283
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:44,180
And it seemed to be hard to…  I thought I’m already over this but it’s hard to let go with it.

284
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,570
-Would you say you are restless?

285
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,640
-Because of the hurried feeling I always feel that I'm late and all the time…

286
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,130
-You feel time passes too quickly?

287
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:33,470
-Yes all the time, that's why I always feel I can not go to bed because I feel during the day

288
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:39,470
I can not perform very much, I'm so tired, so exhausted and when the night comes

289
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:50,070
and I feel better, I feel I have so much to do, to catch up with.

290
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:07,390
And I try to push myself all the time to be able to do things but I can not hurry too much.

291
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,800
-You can not push yourself too much.

292
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:21,210
-Yes, I have to do things slowly. If the time is set, I have to meet someone, I get…

293
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,480
-Excited.
-Yes.

294
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,460
-Can you get a diarrhea from that?

295
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:45,880
-Yes. And if I have to get up early in the morning, I don't sleep very well.

296
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,230
-And the whole night you will be excited.

297
00:43:55,230 --> 00:44:00,230
-Because I'm afraid I'm not going to manage to be on time.

298
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,060
-And that can keep you awake the whole night.

299
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,800
The fruits that you eat, the peaches and pineapples,

300
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:25,400
you prefer to be ripe and sweet or unripe?

301
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:36,640
-Before I used to really enjoy unripen fruits but not anymore. It doesn't feel good.

302
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:47,790
-Can you eat raw onions, they don't affect your stomach?

303
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:56,150
-Yes, they do but I take a little bit. I get very bloated.

304
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:12,880
I feel there is a problem with this eating and there is so much food I really don't tolerate.

305
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:19,130
I hardly don't know what to eat really, either I get very excited or accelerated from the food

306
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:28,730
or I can get very sleepy, just very tired after bread and food like that.

307
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:42,980
And the pulse can really double from 80 to 160, five minutes after eating.

308
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,210
-How is your menses?

309
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:56,060
-My menses are very scanty.

310
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:23,460
And also I feel the circulation is bothering me because if I sit too much, I feel restless

311
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:29,310
because it feels like circulation is …I need to move.

312
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:39,950
-What about your sexual desire? You don't have a partner but do you have the need to have sex,

313
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,200
to have some contact on that level?

314
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:50,130
-Yes sure but it has been less during this period with the remedy.

315
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,280
-It had been less. Too much less, not at all?

316
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:58,080
-Yes, I felt quite dead.

317
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:20,700
-Do you like sweets? You desire sweets?

318
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:29,900
-Yes, very much but after changing the diet now it's getting more normal.

319
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,220
I feel more peaceful and quite inside because I don't have this craving.

320
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:44,970
My blood sugar was much up and down and I feel much better; so I don't take any sugar now.

321
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:52,120
But I used to crave a lot for sweets.

322
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:59,050
-When did you stop taking sugar?
-Almost a month ago.

323
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,770
-Last time you were here you were still taking sugar?

324
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,010
-Yes.

325
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:11,440
-Now you don't take at all?
-No.

326
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:47,210
But I'm much better by moving and also dancing and these things, I'm much better.

327
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,960
It's hard for me to sit still.

328
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,330
-You like motion.

329
00:48:55,430 --> 00:49:02,180
-Yes and because I get freezing cold by sitting, usually, with all this stagnation

330
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:10,260
in the blood and also a lot of pains from the venous system.

331
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:24,410
I have to lie down and put my legs up because of the pain. I can't stand still for a long time,

332
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:26,260
it also starts the pain.

333
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:32,050
-How much salt you need?

334
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:40,920
-It was a period that it was increased, I needed more salt but now it's less again.

335
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:50,410
I think after Phosphorus I wanted more salt but now it's not much but suddenly

336
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:55,270
I can put one salt but I don't need much.

337
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:25,170
-What is now your main feelings inside? Can you describe your emotions? You say

338
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:32,160
they are changing, up and down and you can be very happy or depressed? Something

339
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:41,660
like that you mean? If you wanted to describe, what is bothering you mostly?

340
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,510
What would you say is bothering you as feelings are concerned?

341
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:48,420
-Right now?

342
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:57,260
-Yes, like I'm very anxious or insecure. What is really bothering you?

343
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:02,920
Not this moment this last month.

344
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:17,520
-I worry to be able just to come to class, to get up in the morning, to perform.

345
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:32,520
I'm afraid to over sleep and not be able to attend class in time and things like that.

346
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:49,420
-Have you ever used cocaine?
-Yes.

347
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:51,720
-Lots?
-Not a lot.

348
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,970
-Is anything else you wanted to say at this moment?

349
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:49,580
-Maybe, what is bothering me most is an adult, I got to know a little bit,

350
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:59,590
I'm singing in a choir with him and he is only 25 and I feel such a connection in the soul

351
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:02,930
and it's very, very deep and very painful.

352
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:13,580
And he is so young and it's not possible. It's what is bothering me most, it's been for 2 years.

353
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,350
-For 2 years already.

354
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:25,750
And you feel that you have a very great feelings for him?

355
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:34,600
-Yes, as if I know him or it's very deep, it's very different from what I experienced before.

356
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:41,000
I just met him and on one second I knew it was a strong connection.

357
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:44,250
-What do you think, he has an interest for you?

358
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:53,850
-No, there was a little flirting but I told him I feel inside and he was scared.

359
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,850
He is 25, I'm 16 years older.

360
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:02,930
-You are 40?
-41

361
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:10,940
But I guess that is the biggest problem now, that grief.

362
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:20,190
-Specifically for that case, right?

363
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:33,770
You should enjoy these feelings, these feelings are good. Why not?

364
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:39,800
Even if there is a desperation.

365
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:47,020
-But I feel it's blocking me, I don't want to see others, I don't want to meet.

366
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:58,360
I want to get out of it, I want to move on with my life. It's stealing so much energy.

367
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:14,550
-OK, we see a little bit more clear this time.

368
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:43,290
Do you remember the case?
-Oh yes.

369
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:45,640
-Very well?
-Yes.

370
00:55:54,140 --> 00:56:01,540
-Do you see any difference with this?
-A bit.

371
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,390
-Tiny.

372
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:18,040
-I would like to see a little bit 5 minutes of the case, so you get an idea also those

373
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:20,640
who did not see the case.

374
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:47,990
I want you to see a little bit because when we discussed her case we said,

375
00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:59,460
if I remember well, that this was a very confused case and the confusion was coming through,

376
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:06,310
as an idea. Was this same confusion now?

377
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:15,960
I remember the general feeling was one of confusion and I believe in the analysis

378
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:21,990
I must have said how confused it's the case, no clear.

379
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:35,960
I felt that the main problem, the main impact of disturbance was on the mental level

380
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:47,970
and this weakness on the mental level and that's why I decided to give Picric acid, as she took.

381
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:55,910
She took Picric acid and she had that reaction, which she describes,

382
00:57:56,010 --> 00:58:07,470
which is very interesting reaction, because it was repeated 3 times.

383
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:14,790
I was tending to say in the beginning most probably she had a flu while taking the remedy

384
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:20,960
but the second time she took she had the same reaction and the third time she again

385
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,010
had the same reaction.

386
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,470
So we have to admit that this reaction was from the remedy.

387
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:38,370
Now, as this is a confused case definitely from many points of view,

388
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:48,370
we are trying with the remedies that we are going to prescribe, we are trying to clear up this case

389
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:51,470
until we see some light.

390
00:58:53,220 --> 00:59:04,380
In this case definitely there is a level of Medorrhinum, we hear it the first time,

391
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:13,090
we hear it now the second time, still we don't prescribe Medorrhinum, we prescribe Picric acid

392
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:21,140
and the question now is, is now the time for Medorrhinum?

393
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,970
-No.

394
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:35,230
-Still there is a strong symptomatology for Medorrhinum, the suppressed condylomata

395
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:48,000
indicating very strongly Medorrhinum and the better in the evening it's typical for Medor.

396
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:57,270
We asked about the sex desire, she says it has gone down rather

397
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:13,190
and definitely we see the possibility of another layer here, which is Thuja,

398
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:21,190
especially with the aggravation from onions.

399
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:29,520
So Medorrhinum and Thuja are remedies that we have to consider.

400
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:47,920
Then we ask the patient what is your real problem at this moment and she says 2 things.

401
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:59,670
One is that she has low self-esteem, she does not feel fit for this world,

402
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:11,280
and we perceive a deep sorrow that comes from the rejection of her mother primarily.

403
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:25,020
And we are going to close the case and then she says something very important.

404
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:38,750
I have grief. Why? Because of this young man.

405
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:53,900
And then we reconsider the case because at this moment this is the biggest problem of hers,

406
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,900
this is what she says.

407
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,400
I suffer because of that situation, you can't say your biggest problem is of this and that,

408
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:17,000
she says it now, in her conscious mind she says this is the problem and I can't break through that.

409
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:21,250
This holds me back and I can't progress.

410
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:28,650
We have to take into consideration since now it is expressed the problem,

411
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:35,400
it is expressed in such explicit way, we have to take it into consideration in order to progress

412
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:43,060
with the lifting up of different layers that we are going to do and if we do a good job,

413
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:49,920
in 2 years you may see a totally different person.

414
01:02:51,290 --> 01:03:00,860
We have to do a correct job, is this a Thuja, is this Medorrhinum, is this Zincum picricum

415
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:10,350
because there is a restlessness and at the same time a mental fatigue.

416
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:23,700
Restlessness with mental fatigue, Zinc picricum or is it a case of Ignatia?

417
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:00,700
-I want to suggest Phosphoric acid.

418
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:07,400
-He wants to suggest Phos acid.

419
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,610
-She was sighing a lot and deeply.

420
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:32,280
-Therefore Ignatia. She definitely has the sighing.

421
01:04:40,530 --> 01:04:50,680
-My computer 12 out of 18 rubrics are for Ignatia and there is another rubric,

422
01:04:50,780 --> 01:05:00,930
stays long with disagreeable feelings in the past, so of course Acidum phosphoricum

423
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:07,920
is an important differential diagnosis but as I understood Phosphoricum

424
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:15,880
there are no feelings at all and what I feel with her is a deep sadness and a deep grief,

425
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:18,470
so I would give her Ignatia.

426
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:27,540
-Phos acid of course is a possibility but if we want to differentiate between Phos acid and

427
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:35,850
Ignatia, the first thing we will be looking is, the feelings are alive or dead?

428
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:40,100
Phos acid feelings dead.

429
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:51,490
Picric acid the mental is dead, there is no power, Phos acid the feelings have no power,

430
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:59,390
Ignatia has strong feelings which are kept inside and they eat up the person,

431
01:05:59,490 --> 01:06:03,830
is a silent grief but the feelings are there.

432
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:22,410
As far as we have seen, did we see feelings with her or rather a flat in feelings?

433
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:25,660
Who saw feelings?

434
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:46,640
Strong feelings and romantic feelings. It is a platonic love affair, it's something

435
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:56,390
which she feels quite strongly because for 2 years she can not get away from these feelings.

436
01:06:56,490 --> 01:07:00,650
She says these feelings are keeping me from progressing.

437
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:14,720
Now whether this has come up because of Picric acid or because of the diet, I will not discuss,

438
01:07:14,820 --> 01:07:20,230
we are not interested at this moment. What we are interested is, do we have at

439
01:07:20,330 --> 01:07:28,970
this moment a better picture? This is all that we're interested.

440
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:39,340
Are we going to become more clear? Is she going to become more clear in her picture?

441
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:52,220
And the answer is yes but which is the picture? Is it Phos acid, Med, Thuja or Ignatia?

442
01:07:53,470 --> 01:08:01,810
And we have to differentiate between these and see what should have priority in her case?

443
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:07,560
What should have priority in her case?

444
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:13,060
-The grief.

445
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:23,790
-The grief because she says, I have grief and I have kept it inside and it's a desperate thing

446
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:33,150
because I can not even discuss the matter, it's not even proper, I'm improperly in love.

447
01:08:34,170 --> 01:08:45,290
What she says is very interesting because she says, I'm in love madly in love

448
01:08:45,390 --> 01:09:01,460
with a person with whom it is impossible to have an affair, so what is the state,

449
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:13,810
what is this state? What is this condition, in which remedy we meet this?

450
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,060
-Natrum muriaticum.

451
01:09:18,810 --> 01:09:29,720
-In Nat mur we see this grief, this affair, being in love with somebody you can not have an affair.

452
01:09:35,460 --> 01:09:41,120
So here we have into the picture another idea which is Nat mur.

453
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:48,120
Now the dilemma is, should we start with Ignatia and go to Nat mur?

454
01:09:48,880 --> 01:10:01,540
That means this here will become actually like this. Here is the Ignatia.

455
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:13,940
Is this the strategy that we have to follow with her? Maybe or we can start with this,

456
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:22,540
see what happens, then give Ignatia and that is a problem that we have to solve.

457
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:34,940
-I thought Nat mur earlier, now the physical supports Nat mur more than Ignatia,

458
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,290
the hot palms, the sweating palms.

459
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:52,040
-No, she says I can stay in the sun, I love the sun and I'm freezing.

460
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:57,440
This does not support Nat mur, on the contrary.

461
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:03,940
This is against Nat mur at this moment, I don't know later.

462
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:09,790
I asked about salt, you remember? What was her answer?

463
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:19,540
I used to take more, now I take less.

464
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:34,610
Another point for Ignatia, not so much the food but the way she described changing in her moods,

465
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,360
she said absolutely.

466
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:51,620
So if we collect the information and we put it together, we  come rather to the idea the strategy

467
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:54,460
should be in this way.

468
01:11:56,730 --> 01:12:04,860
Not clear absolutely but we have good reasons for prescribing Ignatia at this moment

469
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,110
with the possibility to be followed by Nat mur, why?

470
01:12:09,210 --> 01:12:20,710
Because the grief is very deep and the rejection from the parents, she has received it very strongly.

471
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:30,610
Therefore I believe that after Ignatia there is going to be a time when she will need Nat mur

472
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:37,360
to continue with Medor and finally Thuja or perhaps another remedy,

473
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:41,870
I don't know maybe even Phos will come again.

474
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:54,870
But at this moment the remedy that we prefer to prescribe in this case is Ignatia 200.
