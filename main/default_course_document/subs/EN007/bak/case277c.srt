1
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,380
-What you took last time?
-Nothing.

2
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:35,770
-And you took Ignatia what potency?
-50M.

3
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:43,870
-In 1 year?
–Yes, was it in May?

4
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,120
–One and a half year ago.
–Yes.

5
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:15,440
-Last May you got no medicine and now what is the situation?

6
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:26,030
-Actually I’m feeling well, both emotionally, mentally and physically.

7
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,940
There are small things that bother me physically and I’m going through a very hard time

8
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:45,240
because for two months I felt that all the dirt, the memories…

9
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,220
-Memories from the past have come back?

10
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:58,630
-Yes. Sometimes when you see things you get sad and sometimes you think

11
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:07,980
this is how life is, everything can change, so I have (?) harder.

12
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:16,900
But these days I feel it’s good because I feel more relaxed.

13
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:31,880
-It is like going back in your life and making a kind of evaluation…

14
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:41,630
-It’s like I’ve been aware of many things in the daily life but also things I have done

15
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,870
before which I’m not proud of.

16
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,170
-And you regret it now?

17
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:56,070
-Of course, I wouldn’t have done today with my knowledge, no, certainly not.

18
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:08,710
But in a way when that period went off, I had a very good time because I felt more in balance

19
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:18,070
but I went off and on by saying, you are a bad girl, you are the best one.

20
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:26,050
-One time this, one time that. For a period of two months this was happening?

21
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:43,640
-From May until end of July. I’m studying esoteric philosophy and there I have many friends

22
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:50,890
who also see things that this is something you are going through.

23
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:56,710
You have to get rid of it because otherwise you can’t go forward.

24
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:06,890
And I really feel it because now I can see my patients more clearly, I dream very vivid.

25
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:12,110
-Like as if you have matured, you became more wise.

26
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:21,650
-And also very frightened for many things actually.

27
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:35,070
In these two months I can’t express and say I was afraid of this or this or that

28
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:43,800
but I just was afraid. I get some heartbeat sometimes…

29
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:51,400
-Are you still with your husband?
-Yes and that’s something I’m very jealous.

30
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,810
-Now you have become very jealous on your husband?

31
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,510
-Yes I realize it when I was travelling down here to Alonissos

32
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:06,750
because we spoke about another family which the husband has gone two weeks on vacation,

33
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:13,800
he is actually a doctor and my husband said, maybe we should go out some time

34
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:21,560
with his woman and I said, oh my god is he going to do that? And I felt really bad.

35
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:29,490
-But you did that before yourself.
-Yes but this time it was different.

36
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,720
I’ve been a little jealous of him about other things

37
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:45,390
because I always thought of him as a really nice man, doing all the wise things that I don’t’ do.

38
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,980
But it felt good in a way too.

39
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:59,140
-In general you feel more balanced and relaxed and not in stress.

40
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:09,980
-No, I’m not so stressed anymore. I don’t train so much and I like to walk in forest.

41
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,560
Do you want me to tell you the physical things?

42
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,940
-Yes.

43
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:04,150
-I told you in May that I was getting very warm. I’ve been tremendous warm now.

44
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:16,400
I’ve always been dry inside of my palms but I’m sweating on my feet and if I walk fast

45
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:26,890
from back and downwards, my hands are sweating and I’m very warm.

46
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,790
Also in the night I can wake up sweating tremendously.

47
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,320
-During sleep?
-When I wake up I realize I’m wet.

48
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,220
-In the beginning you used to perspire only on your face, as you said.

49
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:57,220
-Mostly on the face if I walk fast or training or something, I always get wet on my face.

50
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:05,820
If I’m dancing, I’m wet on the face but I perspire more in hands and feet now.

51
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:25,970
I thought I was going through the menopause because I had menses when I was here

52
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:36,060
in May and 14 days afterwards I got it again and then 14 days afterwards I got it again.

53
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:45,720
One of the menses lasted 14 days and that never happened before. Normally it’s 5 days.

54
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,220
-And since that time you did not have anymore menses?

55
00:08:49,320 --> 00:09:02,500
-Yes but through all this thinking and forth and back maybe it’s distured

56
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,430
because the last one was 28 days as I used to have.

57
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:20,040
During that period my breast was very swollen, I even couldn’t use my usual bras

58
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,510
because it was so small.

59
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:30,870
-Swelling. Before menses or during menses?

60
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:38,390
-Both actually for a longer period than I used to.
-I see.

61
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:57,890
-I also have more sexual desire.
-It’s good.

62
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:14,690
You don’t consider this as a symptom? More sexual desire? It doesn’t bother you.

63
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:22,920
-No it doesn’t. The only thing that bothers me is if my husband has been drinking beer

64
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,020
then I can’t because I can’t smell the smell of the beer.

65
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:43,420
I told you in May that I have burning pain in my…
-Hands?

66
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:55,920
-No, hemorrhoids. When I came down here I got a flu, the same evening

67
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:08,180
when I went to the toilet there came blood and I never had blood in that way before.

68
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,420
-Now you still have the hemorrhoids?

69
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:24,430
-Yes and it’s actually bothering me because they have burning sensation.

70
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,760
-External hemorrhoids?

71
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,750
-Yes as if there is something in the outside of the muscle.

72
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,600
-Very painful or not so painful?
-Not so painful.

73
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,440
–Just burning, itching and little burning.
–Yes.

74
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,520
-Something else?

75
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:58,060
-I got eczema in my nostrils and I got itching in my palms with dry spots.

76
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,990
-Dry spots?
– Yes.

77
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:25,490
I also got itching on my (?) and on my scalp. Once I itched I got a crust but it’s small thing.

78
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:42,470
Two times during this period I thought I was getting a common cold but I have so much work,

79
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,520
so I took vitamin C.

80
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,820
-And it went away.
-Yes.

81
00:12:51,430 --> 00:13:03,330
-During that period did you eat any fruits? Any desire for fruits, you took fruits, you are fruits?

82
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:11,560
-Actually I’ve been eating a little bit more because I can pick them in my own garden.

83
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:26,080
We have plums and I’ve been eating a lot of plums. Apples have not finished yet.

84
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,320
-They are not ripe yet. They call it ripe.

85
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,160
-OK.

86
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:40,650
-So you have been eating more plums, not other fruits?

87
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,950
-No.

88
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,650
-Did you eat any sweets? You started eating sweets?

89
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:50,080
-Yes, I’m eating more sweets and more salt.

90
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,000
-More sweets and more salt.

91
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:14,080
-Also I was going to tell you something because the 25th of August I got bitten by a little insect

92
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:30,560
which gives the borreliosis and I was bitten at 2 o’clock

93
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,150
and I didn’t discover it until 11 o’ clock in the evening.

94
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:47,150
Then I felt, all the day, a sensitiveness on my other arm and in my wrist in the skin area

95
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:52,180
and it was aching in the joints.

96
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:05,080
At that time I was making food for 34 people in big kettles

97
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:17,330
and I thought it might be from this work but when I discovered this I twisted it, put it away.

98
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:26,570
-You took the tick away and there was not any circular (?)

99
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:33,490
so I supposed that didn’t do any harm.
-I hope.

100
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:41,450
-But actually I think it has because as I told you I got a flu when I came down here

101
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:46,270
and I had got feverish and I was sweating a lot during that night

102
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,690
and I went up to one of my colleagues and she gave me a foot reflex therapy.

103
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:57,610
Then all the aching in my joints went away and I felt good for two days.

104
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,460
Today I’ve been a little bit dizzy and not so good.

105
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:23,860
The only thing I put on this place was something called (?) it is drops from (?)

106
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,610
-That medicine is used for prevention?

107
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:36,360
-To clear up the blood actually. I often use it in wounds.

108
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,290
-Like a disinfectant.

109
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:46,550
-But it’s not really so effective as it was before.

110
00:16:52,540 --> 00:17:03,660
-In Germany it seems you have a lot of this disease? Why, do they know why?

111
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:19,110
-But it was really big because I often go to the forest and I can see them on my skin

112
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:26,950
and I just take them away because I always take a bath after going to the forest.

113
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:38,610
-A blood check. After how long you can develop the blood reaction?

114
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:49,040
-Immediately and then it changes, if it comes later, they say it’s already passed a long time.

115
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,310
-So maybe you have to check it when you go back to Germany…

116
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,190
-I’m not German, I’m Norwegian.

117
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:07,040
-Oh yes. In Norway you have the same problem?
-Yes.

118
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:17,290
-We don’t have it so much here. Only in German people I have seen it.

119
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,440
You say you feel more heat in your body.

120
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,690
-Yes that’s the thing which bothers me

121
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:38,940
because when I work with the foot reflex therapy I get so warm.

122
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:46,060
-Did you stay at all under the sun here to see how you react under the sun?

123
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,310
-Yes when I got this therapy, I laid on the beach, I slept for two hours.

124
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:55,570
-In the sun?
–Yes.

125
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:06,290
–And it didn’t bother you?
-No. I went swimming.

126
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:15,360
-In the sea you feel extremely good bathing in the sea or it makes no difference?

127
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:23,860
-If I’m diving in the sea it feels good, if I have to walk, I don’t like that.

128
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,960
-I see.
-But I like to swim.

129
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:05,100
I would like to hear who is for the same remedy to repeat?

130
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:17,850
Who would repeat the same remedy or give a higher potency in this case? Nobody.

131
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Who will think of a new remedy? 6. What remedy, which one?

132
00:20:33,180 --> 00:21:17,840
-Pulsatilla, Sulphur, Lachesis. Who says Pulsatilla? One. Sulphur? Seven. Lachesis? Two.

133
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:27,760
Shall we give Sulphur yes or no? Who says no Sulphur?

134
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:49,520
Why Sulphur? She says the desire for salt and sweet is increased.

135
00:21:54,510 --> 00:22:02,770
Sulphur would have desire for sweets mostly.

136
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:18,770
So there is the Pulsatilla. Why Pulsatilla? Because of the breast.

137
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:36,530
If you consider the symptoms of menses and the swelling and pain in the breast

138
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:48,380
and you consider also the increase of salt and sweets, these together make what remedy?

139
00:22:51,130 --> 00:23:05,500
Calcarea Carbonica. But Cal. Carb. should be rather getting cold. She is getting warmer.

140
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:15,520
She is perspiring more. Again possibility Cal. Carb., possibility Sulphur also.

141
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:22,170
In order to give Sulphur, you have to have perspiration …

142
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:29,160
She starts getting in the skin some problems but little problems.

143
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:35,170
Herself she says, the problems I’m going to tell you are not important.

144
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,510
I feel good, don’t touch the case.

145
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:45,990
This is the idea. In spite of the fact that you may see she is going to Sulphur

146
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:54,840
or Pulsatilla or Lachesis, then still you do not touch the case.

147
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:00,830
But you say, one and a half year ago she got the remedy? Yes it doesn’t matter.

148
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:08,660
You see a very interesting thing which happens in the organism.

149
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:19,160
The organism goes back and evaluates the life, it says oh my god I made some mistakes,

150
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,670
I was stupid, I wish I would not have done it.

151
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:42,080
And this is a good eliminating process, a good clearing. It’s like confession,

152
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:54,830
like you tell to yourself. What she did, what was happening to the organism.

153
00:24:54,930 --> 00:25:04,580
The organism was pushing her to clear up the past. It’s very good process.

154
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:13,610
Why should we interfere with another remedy? Let the organism continue its own journey.

155
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:21,160
There is nothing bothering her. Also the fact that she developed all these skin eruption.

156
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:28,410
It’s not bothering. If the skin eruption becomes really bothering, really bad,

157
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:37,170
later on and then she starts scratching and her life becomes very disturbing,

158
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,270
then you may be thinking of prescribing a remedy, not now.

159
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,750
In spite of the fact that she may get disappointed like the other one, she says

160
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:57,500
unless I get the remedy, I will commit suicide, finish. Forget it, I don’t want to live anymore.

161
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,600
I want the remedy. No, I didn’t mean you.

162
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:17,600
She says no, no, no. Did I say anything about her? She said, no, not me.

163
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:32,360
So this was an easy case.

164
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,100
You had enough.

165
00:26:52,990 --> 00:27:17,890
-Then I got sick in Christmas. I started to have some acid in my stomach, I wake up from it.

166
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,140
-You thought?

167
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:27,240
-No I woke up in the night having this acid feeling in my stomach.

168
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:35,560
I suddenly had to vomit but I couldn’t reach the toilet so I vomit just all over.

169
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,140
-That was one time?

170
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:46,480
-Yes but I also got fever. So either I must have been eating something bad

171
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,440
or I don’t know if it was a flu or something.

172
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,310
-You did not eat outside?
-Yes I was in a party.

173
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:59,160
-You were in a party and how long it lasted this upset?

174
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,150
-3 days with fever.

175
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:07,500
-And diarrhea?
–A little bit but not much.

176
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:18,260
-You vomited several times or only one?
-Only that one. Really strong.

177
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,490
-That saved you.
-Yes I think so.

178
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:32,580
Then I got sick again with a flu in February, then I was really sick.

179
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:40,060
I’ve never been so low in energy, never.

180
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:51,230
I couldn’t even read a newspaper but it was because I got Chlamydia after the flu.

181
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:56,400
-After the flu? Did you have fever?
-Yes.

182
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,400
–How high?

183
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:07,660
-I didn’t measure it because I was giving lecture when it started and I continued lecturing.

184
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,840
-But next day?
–And next day also.

185
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,240
-But you were depleted from energy and kept on working?

186
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,160
-Yes.

187
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,570
–You didn’t stop working?
–No.

188
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,540
–All the days?

189
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:29,840
-I was in another town giving lectures and I realized when I got on the plane that I was going sick.

190
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,080
-Why you say you got a flu? How do you know it was a flu and not a cold?

191
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:45,160
-Because I got this fever, I got aching pain in my bones, I had tremendous headache.

192
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:59,410
I started to get pain in my eyes, the right eye, like it was pushing outside and…

193
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,500
-…and exhaustion.

194
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:14,720
-Yes but that came after, when I got home again because during the night I woke up,

195
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,660
I was really, really thirsty and I drank a lot of water.

196
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:29,090
Suddenly I felt that all energy went away from me, so I had to sit down and then I faint.

197
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:37,080
So I woke up with the head on the table and I had pushed all the things down on the floor

198
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:48,580
and when I woke up I went to the toilet and I had the stool and then I faint again.

199
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,590
-You fainted again after stool?

200
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:56,350
-Yes and then I went to bed and I slept nearly for two days.

201
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:02,250
-But how could you work for 5 days?

202
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:09,750
-It was Friday evening, Saturday and the Sunday until 3 o’clock.

203
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,250
-And you went back on Monday?

204
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,500
-No, I went back on Sunday evening.

205
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:26,090
-On Sunday night happened and on Sunday night and Monday you were exhausted.

206
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:34,690
How long it lasted this exhaustion. The fever I think I had until Friday

207
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:46,030
and then my eye got swollen, I couldn’t see through it but I sent a fax down and I was replied

208
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:59,110
that I would see a homeopath in Norway. Maybe that was because I forgot to tell the case number.

209
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:11,690
I just wrote my name and I didn’t say that I was the case number for 277.

210
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,950
-I see.

211
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:18,300
-But I did get a reply that I should see a homeopath in Norway.

212
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:30,040
Then I went to a doctor and he examined me and that was Monday after one week

213
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:35,630
and he said I had pneumonia.

214
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:48,450
And then he took an X-ray and it showed that the left lung was infected.

215
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:56,710
So then I went home because he wanted me to take antibiotics but I didn’t want it

216
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:05,960
so I said you have to give me one week and then I tried to fax down that I was this case number,

217
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:18,450
in case she hadn’t understand me, but I didn’t get any answer and because I was so thirsty

218
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:26,630
and I was so low in energy, I took Phosphorus C200 and after 2 days I got better.

219
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:43,830
The only thing that remained was that I had obstruction, when I lied down in the afternoon.

220
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,450
It was difficult to breathe.

221
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,470
-When you lie flat?
-Yes.

222
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:57,220
And all the time that I had this pneumonia, I had tremendous pain in my ribs as if they were broken,

223
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,450
every time I coughed.

224
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:06,050
-In the lower ribs?
-No, about here.

225
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:12,550
Every time I coughed I had to hold it because it was tremendous painful.

226
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:18,210
The only thing that stopped my coughing in the night

227
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:28,540
or during the night time was to lie on my right side or on the belly, then I stopped coughing.

228
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:38,320
But I woke up every night at 3 o’clock coughing and then I had to stand up and drink a lot of water.

229
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:43,470
That’s why I took Phosphorus.

230
00:34:47,180 --> 00:35:03,620
When this obstruction was keeping on, I felt I wanted to do something and I tried Sulphur C30

231
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,640
but it didn’t do anything.

232
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:30,170
So on the 7th of April I started in a period to be more sad

233
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:37,950
and I felt that the house was too small, I felt that I was locked up in a way

234
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:48,920
and I started to do this again sighing and I took Ignatia 50M, repeated it.

235
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:55,000
Then I start coughing and (?) the obstruction went away

236
00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:00,750
and I got some symptoms from taking Ignatia.

237
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:13,860
The pain which I told you about in the hip going down to the leg, got more strong.

238
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:28,020
I coughed a lot during the day time.

239
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:38,350
-Are you still coughing?
-Actually I started down here now.

240
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,340
Two days ago I started to cough, I ‘m going to tell you about it

241
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,950
because I got a lot of new symptoms after reaching Alonissos.

242
00:36:48,950 --> 00:37:00,700
But I still drink a lot of water, more than usual and I also (?) in the winter time

243
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:09,010
that I drink more during the winter than the summer and that’s very peculiar I think.

244
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,700
I drink a lot more of water.

245
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:26,800
I had a shoulder pain, left sided and the second day my throat got painful

246
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:36,210
but I also felt I got more energy. I was less tensioned.

247
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,250
-In the house you stay alone?

248
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:52,420
-No with my husband but we bought this house one year ago. I never lived in such a small house

249
00:37:52,520 --> 00:38:03,180
and the rooms are not open, I feel that it’s in a way shocking me, it’s no good for me.

250
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,680
I like to have more space.

251
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:19,940
I started also to eat more after Ignatia, I was eating a lot.

252
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:35,670
The 26th I got some pain in both sides of the ribs as if something was pressing.

253
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:47,670
And it lasted only for one day. Then I got a lot of acid in my stomach

254
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:53,020
and that was for one week very strong.

255
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:07,230
But when I came down here to Alonissos, I didn’t like the heat and usually I do.

256
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:16,690
I had to go out of the sun after staying there for one hour and normally I can lie the whole day.

257
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:25,430
I started to get some headaches from the sun and I got eruption from the sun.

258
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:34,170
All my back has blisters and some part in the front on the chest.

259
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:38,430
-By staying very little in the sun because you stayed half an hour only?

260
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:42,180
-No I stayed probably one hour.

261
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:55,620
-And then you felt tired or you just felt headache coming and then you left?

262
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,920
-That kind of restlessness that I didn’t like to lie there.

263
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:04,420
-Just generally you didn’t like the sun and you left,

264
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,030
where previously you were lying to the sun for the whole day.

265
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:21,750
-My eyes started to give some pus in the morning and in the afternoon.

266
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:32,490
And I started to swell in one gland on the left side and it was painful only when I touched it

267
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:40,920
and when I turn my head but it’s not painful when I swallow.

268
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:56,620
Then two days ago I started to get laryngitis, my voice is not good, you can hear it.

269
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:07,100
But that I had all the winter time, during the lecturing I nearly lost my voice several times.

270
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:14,010
With Phosphorus it went away and with Ignatia it came back.

271
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:34,850
I feel a little bit that I’m not so social. I want to be a little bit by myself.

272
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:42,660
-Tell me something else. How much salt you like?

273
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,250
-During the whole winter I’m eating much salt than usual.

274
00:41:47,350 --> 00:42:03,850
I like the pop-corn, I put salt on it and I eat more salt food but not a tremendous amount.

275
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:09,010
More than usual and I drink a lot more.

276
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:18,840
-What about meat with fat in it? Will you take it or you will separate that?

277
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:30,080
-It depends because if the fat is crispy I can eat it but if it isn’t I have to take it away.

278
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,580
-Always or this is more lately?

279
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:41,160
-I haven’t thought about it but I have been eating lamp down here

280
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:45,850
and I have taken away some of the fat.

281
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:59,000
-Your sleep is good here, is constant or you wake up?

282
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:05,610
-No, I woke up one night at 3 o’clock.

283
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:16,990
-You woke up and you started coughing?
-No, I just woke up. It was on Sunday.

284
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:22,350
-Did you stay for long?
-No, I just went to sleep again.

285
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:39,350
But I wake up early in the morning. Here it’s at 6.15 and for my time in Norway it’s 5.15.

286
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,760
-It’s quite early which is unusual for you?

287
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:54,350
-I did that previously but not while having (?) I didn’t sleep so short.

288
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,160
-What about the hemorrhoids?

289
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:09,420
-Those were also bad when I had this flu. Very bad but actually those were better

290
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,210
from the Sulphur C30.

291
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:17,710
-From the C30 they disappeared?
-Yes. I haven’t have them since then.

292
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:29,220
-Very good and what about the menses? Before menses you have said that before menses

293
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:35,710
and during menses your breast were swollen. Was the last menses

294
00:44:35,810 --> 00:45:00,560
that they were painful and bloated?
-I think they are not so painful.

295
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:12,210
-What about perspiration? You had perspiration quite a lot and waking from perspiration?

296
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:22,060
-Yes I have a lot of perspiration but not so much after Ignatia.

297
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:31,470
Then I was a little bit colder in my arms but down here I had to lay only with the sheets

298
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:45,060
not a blanket. So I’m very warm on my arms and feet during the night time but I don’t sweat.

299
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,460
-Is it still the bloatness?

300
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:59,960
-Yes it’s some but not so tremendous, as it was  before because I had to hold my stomach

301
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,810
when I was walking because it really hurt.

302
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:14,170
-Can you tell me if during this winter something happened in your life which made you sad?

303
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:28,070
-Yes a bit about this house because I started to talk with my husband about it

304
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:35,640
and this house was really a thing he bought.

305
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:45,400
He wanted this house and for me it was a kind of being back because he really wanted it.

306
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,760
-He wanted it, you don’t like it.

307
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:55,220
-In a way it was OK but I felt that he really wanted it.

308
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:00,230
When we went around in this house he told, look how marvelous it is

309
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:06,650
and I couldn’t see it the same way. I saw the outside building was nice

310
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,150
but inside was more closed.

311
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,980
-And you had to put yourself in that situation

312
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,970
because you didn’t want to go against the wish of your husband?

313
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:23,220
-I thought it will be well. I thought it could be a good place.

314
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,560
-But you don’t feel comfortable there.

315
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:38,730
-No, not anymore and when I was in Denmark 3 weeks before coming here, I had to say it.

316
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:45,480
I want to move, I can’t stay anymore and he didn’t reply.

317
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,570
-On the telephone?

318
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:53,800
-No, I said it to him while sitting and I think he is a bit angry because…

319
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:56,750
-Because he likes it.
–Yes.

320
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:10,930
-There is a big problem actually because you feel unhappy in the house but you feel he likes

321
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:19,540
it and you feel that you can not make a decision.

322
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:43,110
-I feel as if I’m …
-Right. Thank you.

323
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:16,940
The acute situation. What happened? Was the remedy correct, yes or no?

324
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:33,590
-When she was telling that she had that strong headache (?) to teach the other people

325
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:36,510
and the pressing pain in the eyes and the coughing,

326
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:42,090
perhaps it would not have been bad idea to take Bryonia.

327
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,930
Because perhaps of not taking Bryonia and working so much it got more difficult

328
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,540
and she developed pneumonia.

329
00:49:55,030 --> 00:50:03,500
-The possibility of Bryonia was there obviously because of the excessive thirst,

330
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,260
the exhaustion and the pain during coughing.

331
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:21,590
Instead of Bryonia, she got Phosphorus and Phosphorus did something.

332
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:44,100
After Phosphorus she got Sulphur. So this acute situation was not treated correctly.

333
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:51,100
There is possibility for Bryonia but Phosphorus, according to what she said,

334
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:56,440
it acted well and it took away most of the symptoms.

335
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:06,050
But they were certain symptoms remained which point to another remedy

336
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:11,790
which is complementary to Phosphorus and which is…

337
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,260
-Natrum Muriaticum?

338
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:28,400
-No, I’m talking about the acute condition of the pneumonia state.

339
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,270
You don’t know which is complementary of Phosphorus?

340
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:39,430
-Arsenicum?

341
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,360
-Arsenicum is complementary but it’s not the remedy that she should take.

342
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:47,350
-Kali Carbonicum?
–Yes.

343
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:55,350
The remedy that would complement the action of Phosphorus in that acute state of pneumonia,

344
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:58,590
was Kali Carbonicum.

345
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:07,100
Because she said, I was waking at 3 o’clock with coughing nobody paid attention to that,

346
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:15,940
not even her and it was a keynote symptom.

347
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:24,520
Therefore, instead of taking Kali Carbonicum, she took Sulphur.

348
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:36,510
What Sulphur did? Sulphur took away the hemorrhoids. That’s bad actually, good for her

349
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:41,510
but it is bad as a continuation of the case.

350
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:45,510
We don’t like to see the cough remaining, the exhaustion remaining

351
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:54,590
and then the hemorrhoids going away but anyhow I believe did not do very much.

352
00:52:54,690 --> 00:53:00,940
Now we arrive at that stage in which she describes her situation.

353
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:14,940
Do you think she is in grief, yes or no?
–Yes.

354
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:18,620
–So this is clear.

355
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:28,770
Do you think that she wants to stay by herself, is true?

356
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:30,980
–Yes.

357
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:39,930
Do you think that the increase in salt is true?
–Yes.

358
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:47,510
Do you think that the aversion to sun is true?
–Yes.

359
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,340
Do you think that Natrum Muriaticum is a good remedy for her?

360
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,850
–Yes!

361
00:53:53,190 --> 00:54:01,950
Very good. So you are a good class.

362
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,030
What potency should she take?

363
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:22,630
If the grief is very deep, you have to go very high. In her case, you can go very high.

364
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:32,140
You saw how 50M acted? You have to go very high, 50M Natrum Muriaticum

365
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:38,890
because the grief in which she is, it’s really a difficult situation.

366
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:47,130
Her husband, whom she likes and whom she wants to be pleased, has a different opinion

367
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:53,130
about the house and in the house she feels constricted and it’s a terrible situation.

368
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:57,130
And yet she can not get out. She said the husband, I don’t like this house.

369
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,140
The husband do not pay attention.

370
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:09,050
Then there is a grief because she feels the husband does not pay attention to her needs.

371
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:21,800
You know that she feels that the husband does not care about me, if for a reason like this comes,

372
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:30,630
is a very strong grief. Therefore 200 will not be enough, 1M will not be enough.

373
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:37,480
She has to go quite high to relieve this kind of grief.

374
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:49,630
So for her Natrum Muriaticum 50M is the right remedy because it comes

375
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:53,900
of course also as a complementary to Ignatia.

376
00:55:56,140 --> 00:56:10,810
But you noticed how much she is sighing. So give first Ignatia and then Natrum Muriaticum?

377
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,640
-No.

378
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:26,720
-Now the symptoms are for Nat. Mur. and underneath is a symptom of Ignatia.

379
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:36,720
We give Nat. Mur. and if the symptom of sighing persists after, then we repeat after Nat. Mur.

380
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:45,820
we repeat Ignatia. This is the right type of thinking for her case.

381
00:56:53,820 --> 00:57:01,470
-She only took Ignatia 4 weeks ago, is it possible it started from the Ignatia?

382
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:06,220
-Yes it is possible because Ignatia was not needed at the moment

383
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:11,840
and she has a kind of established a proving.

384
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:20,050
But what I’m saying is since she has been Ignatia, many times we see like this,

385
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:23,300
they come in a circle.

386
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:30,540
Like Staphysagria-Causticum, Phosphorus-Arsenicum and Calcarea-Sulphur-Lycopodium,

387
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,790
they come in circle, they come again and again.

388
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:48,660
That is why I said, maybe if we see this symptoms persisting, we can repeat later on Ignatia.

389
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,790
Natrum Muriaticum now.

390
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:53,220
-For sighing also?
-Yes.

391
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:59,650
Nat. Mur. may take away the sighing as well.

392
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:08,970
-Why would you think of Ignatia where Nat. Mur. also covers the sighing

393
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:13,720
and also one of the few remedies that covers sighing with grief?

394
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:25,630
-This is true. Why we think of Ignatia? Because she has been Ignatia

395
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:35,960
and the fact that she has a keynote of Ignatia, perhaps it gives you an idea

396
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:44,380
that maybe under Nat. Mur. there is still some Ignatia, maybe,

397
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:49,730
to take out all the grief that was there.
