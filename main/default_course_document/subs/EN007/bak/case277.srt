1
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,140
-Tell us what is your problem?

2
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,240
-Actually I wanted to see you last September because I was in a very big stress.

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:39,640
I’ve been married for 28 years, my marriage nearly broke up.

4
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,800
-When?

5
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:54,410
-Last year and during this year I manage in a way but I feel a very great sorrow inside.

6
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:07,570
Actually I can’t be as happy as I want to be. That’s why I wanted to see you.

7
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:20,850
-When exactly this happened? It was something which was sudden or it was something

8
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:26,190
that was developing and you expected it and finally happened?

9
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:51,270
-I work with a man which distressed me very much because he gives me sexual feelings.

10
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:59,600
I tried to avoid it a long time but he is a very strong person,

11
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,440
I didn’t want to break the partnership, so I broke …

12
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,530
-Marriage?
-No, I didn’t break it up.

13
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,290
I told my husband what was going on and we talked about it.

14
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,290
-You have children?
-Yes two.

15
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:29,030
-So you told your husband what was happening that there was an attraction there

16
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:35,530
and you can not resist and all that. Your husband said, forget it.

17
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:47,540
-Yes, after I told him we got several things trying to be better

18
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:57,470
but still I feel the sorrow inside because I hurt him.

19
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,700
-Now this relationship with the other man is going on?

20
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:25,800
-No, it’s over. It is not there for one year but it makes me feel this way, so it is difficult.

21
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:37,910
-Were you able to cry during all this period or you kept it inside?

22
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,650
-No, I was very hurt.

23
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,030
-Hurt in yourself and hurt in others also?

24
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:57,030
-More by myself I think. But I felt I wasn’t able to feel things properly.

25
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:05,540
Like joy, going out, I like to go out in the forest and see beautiful things

26
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,720
but I couldn’t enjoy it. I just worked, worked, worked.

27
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:18,200
-You feel you are in a depressive state.

28
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:32,710
-In a way yes. But I try to make myself cheer up a little bit, actually the work does me good

29
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:41,970
because I work with people and I’m able to help them, so that's good for me.

30
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,720
-Any physical symptoms?

31
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:04,470
-Every time I go to menstruate I get lumps in my breast.

32
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:17,890
This year I had very severe nodes on my chest, actually on the left side.

33
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,050
-Did you examine it?

34
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,130
-No, I didn’t go to a doctor. I’ve never been to a doctor except when I was pregnant.

35
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,290
-So you are treating yourself actually all this time?

36
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:45,800
-More psychotherapeutic, I’ve seen homeopath once and he gave me so many remedies

37
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,990
that I didn’t want to go to him anymore.

38
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:56,540
-He gave a series of remedies? Did you take any high potency lately?

39
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:16,760
-Not lately. I went 3 years ago, he gave me Thuja 1M, 50M, Sepia 1M, 10M

40
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:34,760
Lycopodium 1M, Mercurius also 1M, Phosphorus 1M.

41
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,010
-Plus low potencies?

42
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:52,330
-We have a teacher in our school who was telling me about the way he worked with low potencies

43
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,260
and he gave me 3 remedies the one after another

44
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,800
but it was D6, D12 and one dose of B30.

45
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,460
-What remedies?

46
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:21,810
-The one was Thuja, (?) Muriaticum and the third one I cant’ remember.

47
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:35,450
-How is your general energy? How do you feel your energy after this grief?

48
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:43,370
-I have to take a break from 1-3 o’clock when I work.

49
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,120
-You work in a hospital?

50
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:50,170
-No, I have my own clinic. I had it for 15 years.

51
00:07:52,920 --> 00:08:03,920
-And from yourself you took a (?) as I understand, you went for holidays?

52
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,970
I ask you how is your energy?
-My energy is good.

53
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,370
-It has not been affected by this grief?

54
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:30,320
-In a way, because I don’t want to be with people, as much as I did before.

55
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,030
-You don’t want to be with people now?
–No, I want to go alone.

56
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:47,880
-You walk alone. Do you sigh a lot?

57
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:57,880
-I don’t know actually. No one has told me that. Perhaps sometimes yes.

58
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,030
-Do you have any fears?
-Yes I do.

59
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,280
–What kind of fears?
–Many.

60
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,920
–Tell us.

61
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:17,780
-The one that disturbs me most is being with people who have a high education.

62
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,070
It stresses me a lot.

63
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:27,530
-Do you feel a kind of lack of self-confidence?
–Yes I do.

64
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:52,550
-What other fear you have?
-When small insects are coming suddenly…

65
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,970
-… become fearful.

66
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:08,110
-I swim a lot but I dislike all the things in the bottom of the sea.

67
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,850
-You don’t like?

68
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:17,860
-I think about it every time I go bathing, when I stay in the beach,

69
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,610
I go bathing 5-6 times in the sea.

70
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,360
-Do you like the sea?
-Yes I like it very much.

71
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:33,200
-And you feel good in the sea?
–Yes. But actually I’m afraid of the bottom.

72
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,440
-So you don’t like to look in the bottom.

73
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:47,100
You are afraid of sharks or just of this darkness there?

74
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,350
-I can’t say.

75
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,090
-Are you afraid of the dark?

76
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:04,590
-I was when I was a little child but my mother (?) to do everything

77
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,190
because she was so afraid so I had to go on, doing everything.

78
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:26,380
But I walk in the forest when it is dark, so I don’t think it scares me so much.

79
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:36,860
-Do you sleep well and wake up refreshed in the morning?

80
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:49,870
-Yes I feel very refreshed when I wake up because if I’m sad or have a hard time,

81
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:55,530
I go to bed and each morning I feel it’s a new one. So it’s a good therapy for me.

82
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:03,130
-So sleep is very good for you.
-But I don’t need much sleep.

83
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:10,730
-Can you tell me what kind of menses you have? They have a lot of blood, less blood,

84
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,130
pains before, depression before?

85
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:22,760
-Actually I get angry, irritation.

86
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:31,550
-Anger and irritability before menses and what about crying before menses?

87
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:41,190
-No. I’m more sensitive in many ways before menses but I’m not crying.

88
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:47,180
-Could you say it a kind of depression before?
-Yes, more that.

89
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:56,510
-So mostly irritability and then some depression together with some lumps on the breast.

90
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,010
The whole breast is swollen?
-Very swollen.

91
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,330
-And painful?
–Yes.

92
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,510
-Was any tuberculosis in your family? Did you have tuberculosis?

93
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:16,260
-They went to examine me when I was 7 years old.

94
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:27,590
I went to a TBC clinic to see if you have the TBC, it was positive.

95
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:42,190
So I went to a clinic from 7-11 years old but they didn’t find any TBC.

96
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,350
My mother also had to go through this.

97
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,430
-Your mother also went through treatment.

98
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:56,780
-Not for TBC but they examined the lungs and …

99
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,930
-Do you have any sensitivity with your lungs? You get easily colds?

100
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:08,300
-No. Nearly never. I just feel it, it’s coming.

101
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:17,100
Every time before the menses I feel I’m getting a cold but when the menses is coming, it’s gone.

102
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:27,090
-Symptoms of cold before menses which they leave you immediately with the flow.

103
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,280
When the flow comes the symptoms go.

104
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:44,180
Have you suffered with any serious disease in the past?

105
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:56,260
-When I gave birth to my oldest child, I was so strong, I was a gymnast

106
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:10,520
and the (?) in the lungs get out to the skin, so it felt like snow in the skin,

107
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:19,490
it’s called acute emphysema.

108
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:32,740
But I’ve never had any troubles with it afterwards. Now I feel I breathe less.

109
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:40,100
-As if you can not take a big breath? You are never satisfied with your breathing?

110
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:49,450
-No, I have to think about to take a deep breath to satisfy yourself.

111
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:57,530
Food, you have desires or aversions for different foods?

112
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:03,180
Do you eat fruits?
-No.

113
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,430
-You are not interested.

114
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:11,930
-I can take apple from the tree in autumn but that’s all.

115
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:17,180
-It doesn’t interest you very much.
-Other fruits you will never take?

116
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:25,180
-Banana I can eat.
-You like them a lot.

117
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:36,780
-No. I know it’s good and I eat it, maybe 2-3 days but it takes months before I eat it again.

118
00:16:37,780 --> 00:17:01,400
But I like fish very much, the meat of lamp but I don’t eat so much meat. More fish.

119
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,210
I’m not so fan of sweets.

120
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,630
-Salt? Normal, less than normal?

121
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:22,430
-No less than normal. If I eat peanuts, I always (?) off the salt

122
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:30,940
but I like more to have a dinner than to have sweets. The warm food.

123
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:44,690
-You like the warm food.
-I’m very warm.

124
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,050
-You do perspire a lot?

125
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:58,930
-I perspire a lot when I’m dancing but not when I’m sitting here, I don’t perspire.

126
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:04,520
-Where do you perspire mostly in your body?
-Under the arms.

127
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,010
-What about the face?
-The face also when I’m training.

128
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,100
-Do you perspire during sleep?

129
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:17,690
-Yes before the menses. Everything is before the menses.

130
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,940
-Premenstrual syndrome.

131
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:31,600
Do you sleep in a particular position only or you can sleep in any position?

132
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:42,350
-I don’t like to lie on the left side so much as the others but usually I lie on my back.

133
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:48,200
When I was younger I was lying on my abdomen.

134
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:52,290
-But no so much now.
–No.

135
00:18:54,030 --> 00:19:02,550
I lie on my back with one foot bend up.

136
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:15,410
-For how many years you sleep in that position? One year, two years or it can be more?

137
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:22,760
-I did it because my chiropractor told me.

138
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:31,340
-There is something else when snowing. I also can feel a kind of getting a flu or cold.

139
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,930
I get very dry on my skin, on my lips.

140
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,000
-What else?

141
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:57,000
-I have a point on my left leg which is hurting me and when I’m sitting for a long time

142
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:04,500
I get pain in my knee.

143
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,660
-Which knee?

144
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,770
-Mostly the left one. Mostly the symptoms are left sided.

145
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,420
-You said you see a lot of dreams. There is any dream you see repeatedly?

146
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,520
-No.

147
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:32,160
-What kind of dreams they are? Dreams that they are pursuing you,

148
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:37,920
dreams that you are falling from high place, do they have a theme?

149
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,540
-Most of them is dreams of nature.

150
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,090
-Pleasant dreams?
-Yes.

151
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:53,840
-Mostly pleasant dreams?
-As I told you, when I wake up I feel good.

152
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,180
I don’t think the dreams are stressing in any way.

153
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:09,030
-What about fear of thunderstorms? Do you have any?

154
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:15,290
-It could be because my mother was so afraid of thunderstorms

155
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:21,620
that she locked us in to a little room. whenever it was a thunder.

156
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:33,280
She hosted me to the room beside (?) but she didn’t want us to see the thunder either.

157
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,370
But I can get out in the thunder.

158
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:41,200
-Not much fear now.
–No.

159
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:47,290
-In your sleep has anybody told you that you are grinding your teeth?

160
00:22:47,390 --> 00:23:06,280
-No. But I can feel that in the last time when this problem started,

161
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:11,780
I can feel that I’m a bit tense.

162
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,890
-You are clenching your teeth?
–Yes.

163
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:32,030
-There is any problem with constipation, diarrhea, stomach problems?

164
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:45,030
-Yes I feel some acids in my upper abdomen, as if it is empty.

165
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:53,390
But I think it is because of my smoking. I smoke too much. I’m stressed.

166
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,030
-The acid in your stomach is because of smoking you think?

167
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:08,530
-Yes because when I smoke lesser, it’s not so bad but when I’m coming down here

168
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:14,530
I drink a little bit “retsina”. But I can’t do it many days, one after the other,

169
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,630
because then I also fell this acid.

170
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:23,050
-Do you drink a lot of alcohol?

171
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:36,880
-No, I’ve never been fan of alcohol because I don’t think I can take so much.

172
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,210
-You can not stand so much alcohol.
–No.

173
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,130
-When you are angry, what do you like to do? You like to express your anger,

174
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,620
you do express it, you shout, you throw things?

175
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:16,120
-Yes, not so much in the last years but earlier I was expressing. They told me I was …

176
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:21,860
-Too expressive.
-Yes I really had to …

177
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,610
-…try to subdue yourself. But in the last year you did not express so much anger.

178
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,260
-Not so much.

179
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:44,620
-Would you say that when this depression started, this problem, there was a time

180
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,370
that you knew from that day onwards or it came gradually?

181
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,140
-I say it came gradually.

182
00:25:53,140 --> 00:26:00,120
-And mostly what affects you now is the fact that you have hurt your husband

183
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,870
or that you have hurt yourself or both?

184
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:12,120
-My husband has always been a very good man and I don’t feel …

185
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:26,650
-You don’t feel you deserve him. You feel you’ve done something which has …

186
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:57,890
It’s all right. You feel quite guilty.

187
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:18,300
Are you in divorce now or you still are together?

188
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,050
-He is (?) if he is able to forgive what I’ve done.

189
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:32,150
-He can not?
-Yes but I can’t forgive myself.

190
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,650
-I think now that’s enough.

191
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:39,090
-Now I believe that as you learn more and more the theory

192
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:53,080
you are able to clarify every case more easily.

193
00:28:53,180 --> 00:29:01,090
In this case we will see the interesting things, which are happening in this case

194
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:06,080
concerning what we have been speaking about in the theory.

195
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:13,430
How this case applies to what we have been thinking about the theory.

196
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:37,020
In this case, you saw some symptoms of Ignatia.

197
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:49,760
You saw some symptoms also of Medorrhinum. We saw some symptoms of Phosphorus

198
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,350
and we saw some symptoms of Tuberculinum.

199
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:08,290
Exactly this is the situation and then we are actually going to decide finally

200
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:15,100
which is the remedy with which we’re going to start treating this case.

201
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:35,000
The first question we’re asking is what kind of symptoms I will evaluate mostly

202
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,640
to start treating the case?

203
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,250
Immediately comes the idea of the layers.

204
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:51,770
Maybe there are a few layers that we have to treat in this case?

205
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:05,420
The answer obviously is yes. What is the uppermost layer that we have to treat?

206
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:18,520
Is this clear? Who says it is clear? Only 50% of the class.

207
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:36,920
Let us say you had the computer…

208
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:44,180
What symptoms have you used Margaret? Can you show the symptoms that you have used?

209
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:17,330
The symptoms that she has used, sighing, ailments from grief, can not weep, indifference apathy,

210
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:27,840
sadness, anxiety of consciousness, aversion fruits, irritability before menses,

211
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:35,190
want of self-confidence, menses painful, sleep position on back.

212
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:47,610
If you take this and you repertorize, the remedy … let’s see. I never said what’s the remedy.

213
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:56,210
Margaret put her own symptoms. Ignatia, Natrum Muriaticum, Nux Vomica, Opium, Pulsatilla.

214
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:07,210
You have been thinking the same way, right? Who thought of Ignatia honestly?

215
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:21,290
Very good, it’s 65% of the class. 65 is a good number.

216
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:31,190
You thought of Ignatia, you looked in your Repertories, still the Repertories will say Ignatia

217
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:37,280
but some of you who did not say, this is Ignatia, you thought

218
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:43,110
what shall we do with better in the sea? She is so much better in the sea.

219
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,610
She said it in such a  way, better in the sea.

220
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:50,950
Find me the symptom, Medorrhinum it’s capital there.

221
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:59,110
This is something on Kent’s Repertory, if I’m not mistaken,

222
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:05,710
in the original Kent’s Repertory better in the sea is with small letters.

223
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:12,460
Who has the original Repertory of Kent? Somebody had the original.

224
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,780
-Amelioration just Medorrhinum.

225
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:54,800
-On what type of letters? Ordinary?
-Yes.

226
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:13,620
-On the original Kent we have this symptom which we know to be

227
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:23,110
so much characteristic of Medorrhinum and eventually he had it with ordinary letters.

228
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:30,530
Now we found out that other remedies also are better in the sea by experience

229
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:37,780
and then what we did we raised the Medorrhinum to the third degree

230
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:45,280
because we have confirmed it again and again and again that Medorrhinum is better in the sea.

231
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:51,880
So in the Synthesis we have better in the sea.

232
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:12,300
Did you find the rubric symptoms of influenza coldness before menses, did you find this?

233
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:22,890
Has anybody this symptom? Who can find it first to get the best marks?

234
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,890
Some they don’t even try.

235
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:38,300
He got it. What’s the remedy?

236
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:45,620
-Graphites, Magnesia Carbonica and Tarentula.

237
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,390
-In the original Kent?
-Yes.

238
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:10,550
-That is another keynote of another three remedies and we have Graphites

239
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:17,550
Magnesia Carbonica… Magnesia Carbonica is the main remedy for this keynote.

240
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:34,790
And Tarentula. We get the idea of Tarentula. We ask her, is she very much in a hurry?

241
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:41,000
-You are a hurry person?
–Yes I think so.

242
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,700
-You like dancing you said, very much?

243
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:58,720
-I’ve been sporting all my life until 4 years ago that I stopped but I like to move.

244
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,960
-Music?
–Yes, I like music very much.

245
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,460
-It makes you feel better?
– In a way.

246
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,060
If I’m alone I can sit down listen to music.

247
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,490
-She does not want to be Tarentula.

248
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,540
-What? Actually I don’t know the remedy.

249
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,040
-Ah you don’t know. It’ s a good remedy, very much energy.

250
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,640
-I’ll take any remedy.

251
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:37,890
-Very much dancing, you take the energy through dancing and through loud music.

252
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:43,640
Wait a moment. Now that we know a little bit more, what is the remedy?

253
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:50,130
Do we change our mind? Do we give Tarentula instead of Ignatia or do we give Medorrhinum

254
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,130
instead of Tarentula or Ignatia?

255
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,880
These are the questions that should go to our mind.

256
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:06,460
The other way of thinking is, what about what we’ve been talking

257
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:25,820
about guilty conscience sigh, depression etc?

258
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:38,650
What about the idea of this level being Ignatia where the underlined level might be Tarentula?

259
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:53,470
Tarentula desires dancing… it comes out and then music ameliorates…

260
00:39:53,570 --> 00:40:02,560
and then chorasia is like that.

261
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:20,580
So you have symptoms of Tarentula, some symptoms of Tarentula you see within a picture of Ignatia.

262
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:46,470
And then better in the sea, maybe one more Medorrhinum symptom are popping up.

263
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:53,470
This is the picture where we have to decipher and whether we start with Ignatia

264
00:40:53,570 --> 00:41:07,210
with Tarentula or with Medorrhinum. Or we go Ignatia – Tarentula – Medorrhinum.

265
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:12,720
Or we start with Medorrhinum. You say it’s the deepest or Tarentula is the deepest

266
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,820
because Medorrhinum can be hear and Tarentula can be there.

267
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:32,250
Also in theory concerning the lifting of what we call a miasm,

268
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:41,830
all these three remedies can constitute one miasm.

269
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:50,840
That means treating this case within 1-2 years where she will take these three remedies

270
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:56,340
where she will feel better etc. you may find in the end of the third year

271
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,270
that she develops symptoms of Mercury.

272
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:13,670
So underneath a miasm which we call, this is the psychotic miasm,

273
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:22,420
here we have the syphilitic miasm, Mercury and Aurum. You may get some depression eventually

274
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:31,420
which looks like Aurum here and you have treated this and this you have now

275
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:41,420
symptoms of Mercury or Aurum, still this woman will be living much longer

276
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:47,020
than if she was left untreated.

277
00:42:53,770 --> 00:43:08,670
Here the Ignatia level it may lead her, if it is very deep, in suicidal thoughts.

278
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:12,130
We asked her whether she had suicidal thoughts?

279
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:21,600
(?) that is the rubric.

280
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:31,920
You see there Aurum very strong, Aurum Muriaticum, Aurum Sulphuricum,

281
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:43,600
Natrum Sulphuricum, Psorinum and let’s see if we have Ignatia, there yes.

282
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:49,750
So Ignatia also may have some suicidal disposition.

283
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:56,750
That means the depression of Ignatia, what we have been talking, it can be of different degrees,

284
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:05,700
intensity and reaches the intensity where really they just want to die. They want to finish.

285
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:17,190
This is not the case with her because she is strong.

286
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:24,770
She has a strong organism which reacts quite good.

287
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:46,170
-First of all I find Ignatia is all right but why not think about Lycopodium

288
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:54,750
as a second constitutional remedy because Lycopodium has also amelioration by the sea.

289
00:44:54,850 --> 00:45:00,670
The most important thing she said to us it was this lack of self-confidence

290
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:23,510
and she has fear of dark, she has this need to move a lot and rankles of the face and so on.

291
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:30,260
And Lycopodium is very well following Ignatia.

292
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:39,360
-Why don’t we? Because at this moment is not our job to find the second remedy.

293
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:48,000
It will be our job after Ignatia. Since I was convinced that Ignatia

294
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:52,260
is the first remedy to be given, then the second and the third

295
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:56,510
are just theoretical questions at this moment.

296
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:05,010
We can not say, I George Vithoulkas solemnly swear that the second remedy in this case

297
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:07,920
will be Tarentula. No.

298
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:14,670
I’m just saying you get some symptoms that show Tarentula maybe Medorrhinum,

299
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:18,010
maybe 100 other remedies.

300
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:28,510
The moment that you clear from the layer of Ignatia then it’s the time to really deal

301
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:35,760
and take into consideration all the symptoms, not now.

302
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:42,010
Now why I stopped taking the case? Because the case clearly indicates

303
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:46,830
that upon the several layers that she maybe has,

304
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:55,430
the layer which was forming as the first layer was Ignatia.

305
00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:00,770
Then you can not say, theorizing and all that, no.

306
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:08,530
Something very interesting which you observe in the case also is what?

307
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:20,340
-I agree with Ignatia that’s clear but I struggle with the strong problem of her

308
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:26,840
that she makes a rapprochement of her, there is a strong feeling of being guilty.

309
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,690
That’s a clear case of Ignatia.

310
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:45,660
-Very good. What is something that impresses you in this case?

311
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:53,080
You have to use your observation all the time. This is strange.

312
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,920
I observe something which is strange, you have to catch it.

313
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,080
-She is sighing a lot without noticing it herself.

314
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:10,160
-Yes exactly. The first thing we noticed when she came, she couldn’t breath

315
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:19,320
and I did it on purpose, I said do you sigh? No. Later on she says,

316
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:28,930
from time to time I have to take a deep breath because the breath has become shallow.

317
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:42,320
Many times we say symptoms that will come from your own observations like this

318
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,690
and will become very important.

319
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:54,170
-I don’t know when but you said once the patient is telling the story in the first sentences.

320
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:58,410
And this impressed me very much with her because she told the story right away,

321
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:04,410
She got those tears in her eyes which she suppressed and the first three sentences showed Ignatia.

322
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:16,660
-Right. But there is another point also of interest to the homeopath.

323
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:24,920
She said, I have never been able to cry and she cried here, why?

324
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,430
Can anybody tell me why she cried in front of the camera?

325
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:43,330
Because of the effort. This is a big effort to come in front of the class

326
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:48,320
and not only in front of the class, there is the camera also,

327
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:59,600
it’s everything and she has to tell and this excitement which she has,

328
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:08,820
can not control logically anymore because the excitement is so much that the mind can not control

329
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,580
and she used to be controlling, controlling.

330
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,910
When the excitement is there and then you have to perform, we say OK you act.

331
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:28,160
Then the emotions are out of control and that is why,

332
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:39,360
the same way this Chinese lady has said also.

333
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:47,620
That is out of control because of the situation she faces for the first time.

334
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:54,260
The possibility to talk about her emotions and in front of the class, under great stress.

335
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:02,910
-I would like to ask a question. Isn’t this part of the constitution of Ignatia

336
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:08,410
because in the Repertory we have these two rubrics, thinking about complains aggravates

337
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:11,910
and (?) during her symptoms.

338
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:24,510
I think even concentrating upon her problems, this is enough for Ignatia to get to (?)

339
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:28,830
-There is no question we have enough symptoms for Ignatia to prescribe.

340
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:37,430
Is this a constitutional Ignatia? I put a big question mark.

341
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:43,570
She is not a depressed person all her life. She is a person full of life,

342
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:50,830
enjoying herself dancing, music, not a closed person.

343
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:57,580
Now, she says, the last two years I don’t want to see many people.

344
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:05,080
That shows the closeness, she is becoming a close person.

345
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:10,660
She doesn’t want to discuss, she doesn’t want others to know. She becomes more closed.

346
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:15,410
She is not so social. This is how the disease progresses.

347
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:21,160
And from that state, if she is not treated with Ignatia, she will progress to another state

348
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:28,590
where she may find her physical body being affected.

349
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:43,000
And the physical symptoms which are mostly connected with menses,

350
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:50,000
if she had come before, she would have come to be treated for a premenstrual syndrome.

351
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:58,330
Would you give Ignatia to her, from what we imagine now,

352
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:04,680
according to the premenstrual syndrome? It seems no.

353
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:17,500
With the symptoms that she relates concerning the premenstrual syndrome

354
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:26,500
and the other symptoms in general, which point to a constitutional type,

355
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:33,990
all the symptoms if you put them together, then you come to the idea of Tarentula most probably,

356
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:38,700
as more constitutional more deep remedy.

357
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:46,950
But definitely at this stage you will have to give Ignatia to counteract

358
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:52,550
this terrible feeling of guilt which is with her.

359
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:07,410
She seems she has suffered enough because 65% of the class could see the remedy.

360
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:22,000
Why she did not take it? Because she had to suffer and once she suffered enough

361
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:29,740
there is somebody who says, OK you suffered enough, take Ignatia and finish the suffering.

362
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:35,500
That means she has learned whatever it is to be learned most probably.

363
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:44,760
In a human way we can explain the situation in this way because now the suffering will be less.

364
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:52,270
If you are a moralist you may say, with your Ignatia you take away the suffering.

365
00:54:52,370 --> 00:55:01,000
Is it correct or not? How do you take the suffering from a person

366
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:08,590
that has to develop spiritually so you let him suffer. Because she has done something wrong.

367
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:21,580
No. Our job is to help human suffering irrespectively of the logic

368
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,330
of the morality behind the issues.

369
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:32,830
We are not gods to judge who has to suffer or who has not to suffer.

370
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:41,910
We are humans learning a science that can alleviate the suffering.

371
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:47,920
If this not allowed to be cured, then simply you will not find the remedy.

372
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:57,690
As we find the remedy so easily, that means this person is allowed not to suffer anymore.

373
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:06,080
So by taking today, by tomorrow already all this guilt, all these feelings will be…

374
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:17,840
And on Thursday when we take back a follow up of the case, we will see the difference.

375
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:36,550
Ignatia 50M, one dose. Ignatia 12 will make her well after about 20 days.

376
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:46,630
Ignatia 200 after 3 days, Ignatia 50M after 2 days, maybe 1 day, maybe tonight.

377
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:16,440
-Not a question actually, remark. Last year in the party she was dancing

378
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:21,190
and I looked at her and I couldn’t take my eyes of her. I didn’t dance,

379
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:27,760
she was dancing for 2-3 hours until she was completely wet, so beautifully and I said,

380
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:33,510
this is a Tarentula and I called a Tarentula lady after that evening.

381
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:36,760
-Very good because I have done the same. I didn’t want to say it

382
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:50,950
but I had observed the same observation. She was dancing right there in front of the …

383
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:53,950
-Yes like dynamite.
