1
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:42,430
I want to show you now another case which exemplifies another aspect of Arsenicum

2
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,330
and I have chosen three cases.

3
00:00:50,590 --> 00:01:09,870
One which is what you saw, the emotional frigidity, the emotional coldness of Arsenicum,

4
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,620
how cold the Arsenicum feels, how cold it feels in the emotions,

5
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:26,390
when the emotions go inside and then the physical aspect of Arsenicum

6
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:37,130
and finally I want to show you the paranoic state of Arsenicum as well,

7
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:43,130
which is another deep pathology of Arsenicum.

8
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:50,790
So the second case will be the woman from America.

9
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:09,700
This case is a quite severe pathology case according to my understanding

10
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:17,290
for which I have predicted in my analysis of the case as severe aggravation.

11
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:27,280
It’s a pity that John could not trace the follow up by the practitioner.

12
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,390
This case stayed far away.

13
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,600
This case was coming away from Berkley where I was giving the course;

14
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:50,110
it was 2-3 hours away and there is the doctor who has attended the case

15
00:02:50,210 --> 00:03:03,710
and he had given a follow up about 10 days later.

16
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,700
But his follow up should be here, we could not trace it.

17
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:27,600
-This is a case of a 28-year-old female who has arthritis starting in the left foot

18
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,210
about one year ago, October 85.

19
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:38,680
She started having pain in the metatarsal- phalangeal joint, only the second toe.

20
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,350
Starting with pain and then within a month the toe started to swell.

21
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:51,590
At that time she was having her 4th month of pregnancy and had a work-up at that time

22
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:58,340
with X-rays, blood test, everything was normal, X-ray showed little periosteal reaction

23
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,840
but otherwise it was negative.

24
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:11,440
They finally aspirated the toe and grew out a really rare fungus called  Cladosporium sp.

25
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:18,580
They see it in Australia, South America, the Aborigines when they are hunting

26
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,920
they step on thorns and they get this fungus and the fungus isn’t supposed

27
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:32,660
to affect bones and joints, it’s mainly under skin but it has not known effect on joints.

28
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,670
So there was no treatment given at that time.

29
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,660
The consideration for the treatment was amphotericin B.

30
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,240
Because of her being pregnant at the time, they decided not to do that.

31
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,990
The pregnancy itself was a very special pregnancy.

32
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:58,750
She had had 6 pregnancies, she had 2 miscarriages previously and the pregnancy

33
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,680
before this one was very heavy.

34
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,540
During this pregnancy  she was really concerned about the baby survival.

35
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:17,140
She was really stressed and she was so much stressed that she was worried she might die.

36
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,790
So the pregnancy was a very big stress.

37
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,050
Then about January right toward the end of the pregnancy,

38
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:29,710
she developed a rash called herpes gestationis  which it’s not really a herpes virus,

39
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:36,460
it’s more warts. She did get some open sores but mostly this warts itched and tensed.

40
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,880
When I took the case at that time, the story she told me was that she was worse in heat

41
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,620
and better if she kept cool.

42
00:05:47,720 --> 00:06:01,430
Roger saw her later on and the history he got was that the rash was much better with hot showers

43
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:07,010
but when I originally saw her, it was better if she kept cool.

44
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,530
She was given prednisone for the rash at that time. She took prednisone for a couple of weeks.

45
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,020
The rash cleaned up immediately but the joints never changed at all

46
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,510
and so she called me in early February and she told me the problem

47
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,030
and said that they want me to have a synovectomy next week,

48
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,380
what can you do for me before next week?

49
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:36,690
The case I got at that point was that the pain was in the second toe,

50
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,520
it was painful to move the toe at all…

51
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:50,770
-What I want you to know here also is the subjectiveness of the information.

52
00:06:50,870 --> 00:07:00,940
That means an information is given and one doctor understands she is better from cold

53
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,290
and the other one that she is better from warm.

54
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,220
Why is that?

55
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:18,430
Because sometimes the information that the patient is giving is an answer to a question

56
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,690
that she has misunderstood most probably and that’s why

57
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:26,230
when you are going to base a prescription upon a symptom, especially 1-2 symptoms,

58
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:31,770
see that these symptoms are really there and you have confirmed the symptom.

59
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,810
Repeat the question, take another angle, ask from another point of view.

60
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,320
You are going to base your prescription upon whether she is better heat or better cold,

61
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,750
better you make sure what it is.

62
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,980
You see with the Arsenicum, it is better cool or better warm?

63
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,830
-Warm.
-It depends.

64
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,730
-It’s better warm but I’ll tell you an experience from when I was studying in India

65
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,050
to a little hospital that was attached there. They called us for a patient

66
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,410
who was under severe pain.

67
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,930
The nurse came and said the patient is under severe pain, tremendous pain

68
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,140
and so we went upstairs and saw the patient lying in bed,

69
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:33,830
holding the back portion of the bed and shouting something in Hindu

70
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:44,740
and she was perspiring there and there was another nurse who was fanning the patient

71
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:51,420
and the patient was saying “water” and she was in agony, in pain.

72
00:08:51,520 --> 00:09:05,840
She had kidney colic. When we entered we just saw that picture, this nurse fanning this person,

73
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:12,580
he is in India, it’s hot weather usually but at the same time I noticed

74
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,260
that the patient is covered by two blankets.

75
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:29,420
You don’t have the time to ask questions under that stressful situation.

76
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:38,910
Are you afraid of death? There is a picture, a severe pain, it’s not going to give you information

77
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:45,660
but what you see is already so eloquent that gives you the whole story of the case.

78
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:54,170
A person under heat covered with two blankets, that means she is feeling cold in the body,

79
00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:00,660
while the head is so warm that she asks from the nurse to fan her and the nurse is fanning her.

80
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,920
At the same time asking all the time “water”. What is the remedy?

81
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,460
Arsenicum.

82
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:19,860
Arsenicum relieved the pain within seconds. It was a case that kidney colic could be relieved.

83
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,540
Not all kidney colic can be relieved in seconds.

84
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,440
Don’t expect that because the stone is big in the ureter.

85
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:42,070
We have a relief even with the right remedy which is of the order of 20-30% of the pain

86
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,930
but not more than that.

87
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:59,350
Because the spasm of the ureter, it can not break the stone, the stone is of such a shape

88
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:07,280
that hurts the ureter. You do not expect to cure all kidney colic within seconds.

89
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:16,110
But if it is possible to pass the ureter with relaxing, the stone will be gone

90
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:23,930
and within seconds the colic will be gone like it was in this case.

91
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:30,430
So in Arsenicum when you ask, are you better from cold or warm, it depends what she means.

92
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:37,190
She thinks about her head and says, I’m better from cold, she thinks about her body and says,

93
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,200
I’m better from warm.

94
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:46,540
So you have to be aware in Arsenicum and in different other remedies also.

95
00:11:53,050 --> 00:12:00,440
-It was really swollen, it was warm and red at that time, it was better with ice packs

96
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:16,530
and also better with warm and it was worse with any motion or any jar.

97
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,520
-When you say second you mean next to the top?

98
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,400
-Yes next to the top. I’m sure it was days it shouldn’t have been not so bad

99
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:33,990
and days that had been really bad, it was come and go. She was more irritable and bitchy

100
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:41,820
since that happened, she was herself  she describes herself as an active person, a real doer,

101
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:54,360
she is very self-motivated, a lot of self-confidence and aggressive at least at this point,

102
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,410
when I saw her.

103
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,490
She was very upset that she was sick, she doesn’t tolerate sickness at all, being out of cotrol

104
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:09,210
and the fact that she was sick with any kind of a problem was…

105
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:15,890
-She can not tolerate the pain actually?
-The pain and the fact that she was sick, both.

106
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:25,050
She is very fastidious, she can’t stand dirt and she actually had a germophobia,

107
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:32,030
she washes her hands all the time, maybe 20-30 times the day she washes her hands.

108
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:43,030
-You see whatever he has mentioned. Arsenicum fears of losing control.

109
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:52,440
He wants to be in control of things, that’s why he wants order, to have control.

110
00:13:52,540 --> 00:14:01,040
This is the idea behind, the insecurity on different levels, so he wants to be in control.

111
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,430
You see another aspect of Arsenicum.

112
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:21,260
The previous one could you say it’s a case of self assurance of self confidence? No.

113
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,000
This one you can say is a case of self confidence, I can do it.

114
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:33,510
The Arsenicum becomes self confident because he organizes, accomplishes things etc.

115
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:39,260
but once this order is gone away or something is gone, then they are gone into pieces.

116
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,510
Then comes the anxiety, then comes the fear of death, then come all the catastrophes of the world

117
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:50,850
and Arsenicum goes into anxiety and neurosis states.

118
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:11,160
Also the desire of the Arsenicum for cleanliness you will see that it will be taken quite far

119
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:21,650
and will produce a symptom which we call it phobia of the germs, germ phobia.

120
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:35,710
Which is a symptom found mostly in Syphilinum first, Sulphur second, Mercury also has that,

121
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:47,560
Pulsatilla has that and of course Arsenicum, fear of germs, fear of being dirty.

122
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:11,220
In your book it says washing constantly her hands, only Syphilinum you have there 1 to 4.

123
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:21,570
You can add Sulphur, Arsenicum, Mercury and Curare.

124
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:24,880
-It says delusions.

125
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:33,400
-Delusions is a little bit different. It’s a case of mental.

126
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:43,230
-What about Ratanhia, you can add?
-No.

127
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:55,560
The remedies I give you, Sulphur, Arsenicum, Mercury have been repeatedly confirmed

128
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,910
about that symptom.

129
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,800
Where before it was only Syphilinum and everybody would give Syphilinum and many

130
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:17,150
cases would not be touched. Here you have much more possibilities.

131
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,760
-She puts alcohol in the doorknob. She’s got 4 little children and even with her children

132
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,560
she is always doing this.

133
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:43,050
She sleeps on the left side, she likes to be by herself. She doesn’t like to socialize.

134
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:51,630
If she is with people, only with respected people she has respect for.

135
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:57,710
At that time she had a craving for oranges and thirst but she likes ice cold,

136
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,410
always likes ice cold drinks.

137
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:13,130
She fears heights which was new, she was chilling one time but she doesn’t like warm rooms

138
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:25,230
and excess heat bothers her, she would not stick her feet out of the bed at that time.

139
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,380
Her sex energy was absolutely absent.

140
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,630
-You see some symptoms here that don’t sound like Arsenicum, she doesn’t like excess heat,

141
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:41,370
she sticks her foot out of covers and yet she will take Arsenicum.

142
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,220
What is happening?

143
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:54,220
Arsenicum is a cold remedy, ameliorated by warm, yet desires cold drinks.

144
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,960
It’s a characteristic, this we don’t bother by desire of cold drinks,

145
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:07,950
Arsenicum has it strongly but worse bothered by heat, usually Arsenicum will say I love heat,

146
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:19,220
I sit under the sun, I live by the sun, I sit on the heater, they are really cold

147
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,460
and they want to be warm. What happens here?

148
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:33,130
Why do we disregard the fact that she does not like too warm rooms?

149
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:39,190
Because first of all it’s not a very strong symptom, she is not aggravated by heat really.

150
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:46,380
If she was really aggravated by heat, then we have to think twice before we go

151
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:54,460
and prescribe Arsenicum but here the possibility is that under the Arsenicum,

152
00:19:54,560 --> 00:20:01,710
after the Arsenicum, maybe Sulphur is lurking underneath that it will be needed later on.

153
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:10,290
So the coldness that she has is enough for us to prescribe at this stage Arsenicum,

154
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:18,540
which covers her fastidiousness, her order, her self confidence and we will see how she is

155
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:27,110
and she behaves and also the fear, she has a fear about germs and the desire to wash

156
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,720
and to be clean.

157
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:42,870
-At that point I gave her Ledum and I gave her 30C once the week.

158
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,870
I found out that next week …

159
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:56,130
-You see why he gave Ledum? Because of the pathology, because Ledum is a remedy

160
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:02,130
that could be thought in uric acid conditions, what we call gout

161
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:05,950
and this looks like gout situation.

162
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:11,720
For me it is not diagnosed properly.

163
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,790
I don’t know if any of you got the pathology of the case?

164
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,140
Did you get the pathology, did you understand the pathology?

165
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:34,120
These severe kind or arthritic conditions with swelling, it looks like uric acid

166
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,800
but it is spreading too much.

167
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:43,550
Uric acid usually is located in one joint when the uric acid is very high in the blood.

168
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:52,280
She has also a skin eruption that looks like fungus eruption and for this condition,

169
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,810
she has been prescribed allopathically amfotericin B.

170
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:09,620
Amfotericin B, do you know what medicine is for? It is antifungal drug

171
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,540
which is prescribed in deep fungus situations when fungus are deep into the body.

172
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:24,780
It is very powerful, with great side effect drug and why did they think about it?

173
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,810
Did they think as a deep fungus condition?

174
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:36,630
Maybe but anyhow what she has described is not a simple arthritic condition

175
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,300
or a uric acid condition. It is something else.

176
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:49,960
It is of those new diseases that are coming up with the medicines that have been used so far,

177
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:55,210
allopathic medicines, changing the inner defenses, the immune system

178
00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:01,810
and producing new kind of situations in which we have in this case.

179
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:08,290
So he prescribed according to pathology, Ledum.

180
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:21,190
With no result of course and with a possibility that he may suppress a little bit

181
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,380
the local condition.

182
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:31,780
-…nothing had happened and she decided not to have a synovectomy.

183
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,530
So I gave her another dose of Ledum 30 and repeated it the following week

184
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:42,280
and I started again a month later, no less than a month.

185
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,790
At that point the pain in the second toe became less but now the swelling

186
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:57,280
and the pain moved to the third toe and she described the pains as burning, stinging pains,

187
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,790
swollen, she felt like the toe was constricted.

188
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:17,700
The toe was red and warm, so I gave her Apis at that point, which did essentially nothing.

189
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:24,040
The same history and because next time she came she said to me that

190
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,370
what happens is it will be all right for a few days, it just blow up and so because the burning,

191
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,950
stinging pain was acute, I gave her Formica rufa.

192
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,120
It seemed to get worse and then it came back to the usual level.

193
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:58,870
When I saw her in April, the third toe now had calmed down and the fourth toe 5th metatarsal

194
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:05,610
and to the medio side of the ankle, at that point.

195
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,860
So I repeated all the blood tests at the point.

196
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:15,110
All the blood tests were normal, her SR rate was minimum elevated, it was 24, the average is 15,

197
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:20,860
her X-ray her feet at that time showed the initial reaction she had,

198
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,620
that was gone and now she had more reaction in the area where she was inflamed

199
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,960
but not in the ankle. The ankle X-ray was normal.

200
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,430
We re-aspirated the joint at that time and didn’t grow anything out.

201
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:41,190
Everything in the aspirate of the joint was normal at that point.

202
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:50,700
At that point because she was emotionally healthy and we got a discussion about scriptures

203
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,280
and everything was so cut and dry, so moralistic in her,

204
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:01,360
that I gave her Kali carbonicum at that point and again nothing happened.

205
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,350
So I sent her to see Roger at that point and this is in June.

206
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,600
The case that Roger got was pretty much the same.

207
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:17,690
The differences were Nr 1 that her joints were worse cold at this

208
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:23,860
point and much better with heat and hot showers.

209
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:33,400
The other thing was that when she had the rash, it was better with hot showers.

210
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:38,600
At this point when I saw her she was chilling, underlined once,

211
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,160
when Roger saw her she was warm blooded, underlined 3 times.

212
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,270
-But still the local inflammation would be better warm?

213
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,780
-Better warm at this point.

214
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,770
-But she was warm blooded herself.

215
00:26:52,870 --> 00:27:00,020
-When I saw her in winter where she lives, it’s cold then and by the time Roger saw her

216
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,350
in June it was 105, she is much warmer at this point.

217
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,590
Her sleeping at the left side was much more prominent at this point.

218
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,680
Roger had underlined it 3 times, I only underlined it once.

219
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:26,840
Still craving ice drinks, also creamy, ice cream, bread, pastries underlined 3 times,

220
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:35,840
oranges 3 times. Bread and pastries, sweet cakes.

221
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,000
-Another point concerning the desires of Arsenicum, if you look at the Arsenicum

222
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:45,030
you see farinaceous food, what it has desires or aversions?

223
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:11,410
Page 480, aversion farinaceous food, the Arsenicum and Phosphorus together

224
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,420
they have aversion for farinaceous food.

225
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,850
Both of these cases they said, desire bread and farinaceous food.

226
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:38,860
Did you see the Repertory is indicative, it’s not final.

227
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,010
It might indicate to you, it might give you some hints, it’s not final.

228
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:50,010
What is the difference for me prescribing this case and the other practitioners?

229
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:55,250
He is also quite good, he is not so many years following the teaching but he is quite good

230
00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:05,100
and Roger also took the case and underlined 3 times the worse heat.

231
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,500
I’ll tell you what is the problem. You want to give a remedy and you want to confirm the remedy.

232
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:18,830
You want to give Sulphur, you say, are you feeling warm? Yes, terrible.

233
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:27,580
In 105 degrees outside, everybody would say, I’m feeling terrible in the heat

234
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,500
but why you don’t keep on asking whether this is now because of the heat or it is usual?

235
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,010
The usual condition, in which case you would have said, no when I’m in the mountains

236
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,560
I suffer from cold.

237
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:47,520
If you want to give Sulphur, you are determined to give Sulphur, then…

238
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:57,010
So you have to be very careful, especially on what you are going to base your prescription.

239
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:03,690
Don’t rely easily upon an answer unless the answer is immaterial.

240
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:23,380
-Averse fish, fear heights and fear of robbers. She would look under the bed looking for robbers.

241
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:43,340
-Look, fear of robbers.
-Arsenicum capital.

242
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:54,090
-Do you see there? There is a microbe phobia, germ phobia, there is all these other symptoms,

243
00:30:54,190 --> 00:31:01,830
she washes, she is orderly, very fastidious and yet if you want to give Sulphur

244
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:06,170
you make worse heat and you miss Arsenicum.

245
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,000
The information is there, you just disregard it.

246
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:21,650
I will tell you this is a great teaching case because this is not an unknown remedy.

247
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:28,410
If I prescribed Gallic acid, everybody can say forget it, nobody can think about that.

248
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:33,830
But if we talk about Arsenicum, everybody should think about Arsenicum. Why?

249
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:42,080
The information is there constantly. What made them not to find Arsenicum?

250
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,090
Do you know what?

251
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:54,590
They don’t listen, they don’t listen. They listen with preconceptions.

252
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,990
If I see a case and I think she is Natrum muriaticum,

253
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:01,500
I want to make this case a Natrum muriaticum.

254
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:08,900
I do not listen therefore, I listen to my own mind, saying ask this question.

255
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,160
Desire salt? Ah yes very good. This is what I’m listening.

256
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,430
I exaggerate a little bit but this is what we are doing.

257
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,150
How do you feel about the sun?

258
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:34,990
I don’t like, oh very good he doesn’t like the sun but she is hesitating,

259
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:40,490
you saw her she’s hesitating, you saw her she did not answer immediately.

260
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,820
Tell me why she did not answer immediately,?

261
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,150
These are the questions you should ask yourself because these are the facts.

262
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,890
If you want to make a case Calcarea carbonica, you make a case Calc. carbonica,

263
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:54,500
there is no question. I can make you any case, anything.

264
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:03,890
The thing is to empty yourself from what you think, yourself

265
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:12,230
and let the object come through you and fill you with the right information, this is the idea.

266
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:21,720
Empty yourself from your conditioning and you will see beautiful information comes.

267
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:30,330
Don’t interfere with your knowledge, with your ideas about the case and examine.

268
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:41,240
Why can I see she is telling a lie? It’s not what she says, what she means it’s different.

269
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,490
Why do I say that? Because I listen.

270
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:51,410
As homeopaths we need the real information, we can not work with false information.

271
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:56,810
If somebody gives us false information, we’re going to come into false conclusions.

272
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,310
We need the real information, what really happens within the human body.

273
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,890
That aspect you have almost to tell yourself to do it.

274
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:12,810
Just don’t listen. Doubt yourself. A Sulphur, doubt it until the last moment.

275
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:17,670
Confirm it again and again and again until you are happy and satisfied.

276
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:23,910
Don’t jump into conclusions. It’s Sulphur, it’s Lycopodium.

277
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,870
This is where most of the mistakes are made.

278
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,720
I listen and I doubt. You see this case for me, as I hear it from you,

279
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:49,150
is a clear Arsenicum case but I will ask the possibility of this remedy, of that remedy,

280
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:55,310
of another remedy to differentiate and then every time she will bring me back to Arsenicum,

281
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:58,500
then I say OK, Arsenicum.

282
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,500
-Confirmed later on.

283
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:13,730
-At that point I gave her Colchicum 200C, which essentially did nothing.

284
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:20,640
Roger and I talked about, because of the modalities of the joints and the fact that

285
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:30,990
the rash she had was so much better I gave her Rhus tox which did nothing and then I saw…

286
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,580
-Before Rhus tox, it was given Colchicum.

287
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:45,650
-A month later with a sense of the same case and I gave him Sulphur, which did nothing.

288
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,610
And then the most recent remedy she got in early September was Syphilinum.

289
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,020
She had some changes since the Syphilinum.

290
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:05,510
Nr1 the bottom of the foot started to swell again that had not been any problem since May.

291
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:13,520
She also now has developed pain in the right heel, which is new and now a symptom

292
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:19,860
that had been worse at night. She is no longer worse at night.

293
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:28,270
-Do you see the changes? These are bad changes now because the remedy is not correct,

294
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,760
it’s changing the symptomatology and if you keep on prescribing the remedy,

295
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,370
you change completely the case, the case will be a mess.

296
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:43,370
It is destroyed and you say Homeopathy can not work.

297
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:53,110
But when he goes into deeper levels, he takes into consideration now the microbe phobia

298
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,600
and he gives Syphilinum.

299
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:03,200
Why? The case has not been studied properly because the information was there.

300
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,010
You can’t say you have intuition. I don’t accept that.

301
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:20,610
Is that intuition to prescribe Arsenicum in this case?

302
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,760
Everything it has given, it says Arsenicum, Arsenicum, Arsenicum…

303
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,700
You can’t say I have intuition, not to that.

304
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,790
Because he is a more recent student, he does not know yet the remedies etc.

305
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:58,200
-She gets up on her feet and she’s been up on her feet for 5 hours and it starts to hurt.

306
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,850
-If she is for how long?

307
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:04,880
-If any period of time, she is out of feet in bed, she is sleeping better at night,

308
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,970
she doesn’t bother at night now but if she gets up on her feet, it bothers her.

309
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:23,780
She has also some numbness in both of her big toes. A big change in her,

310
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,390
she’s developed a despair of recovery.

311
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:34,590
-She has developed despair of recovery. You see now?

312
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:42,310
I showed you despair of recovery on the previous case and you see how strong it is with Arsenicum.

313
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:55,210
-With the despair of recovery she’s got a lot more anxiety and her self confidence has gone down,

314
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:02,230
she is starting to wonder now, she didn’t see herself as having emotional problem

315
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:06,070
and now she is starting to wonder that maybe she is doing that to herself.

316
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,460
-She is doing what?
-Her emotions are causing all this.

317
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,210
Her friends had telling her about the emotions and she started reading books about emotions

318
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:21,270
and so she’s become much more sensitive. In the last couple of months

319
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:28,710
she started to weep a little bit more, especially when she thinks about bad health.

320
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:33,700
It’s really hard for her to have this problem because she’s always done everything to be healthy,

321
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:40,980
she exercises, she eats right and she doesn’t understand why has this happened to me.

322
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:50,640
-Another point of Arsenicum. What he says is, she always did everything to be healthy.

323
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:56,220
Unless you have an anxiety about your health, you don’t do everything to be healthy.

324
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,220
I can tell you that, I know about myself, I always do the wrong things.

325
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:10,390
So if you have an anxiety, it prevents you from getting diseases and things like that

326
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:16,290
but you have to have some anxiety inside to drive you into doing everything possible

327
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:18,740
to be healthy.

328
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:33,230
Eat healthily, from yourself you know, who cares? Some of you don’t care, you smoke.

329
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,640
A little bit of anxiety is good sometimes.

330
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:07,490
-I saw you are limping. How long you can walk now with the condition that you have?

331
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,630
-I can go for ever and the pain, it’s getting this the pain level,

332
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:16,610
in the morning is just terrible.

333
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:21,610
-In the morning, as soon as you wake up or as soon as you step out of bed?

334
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,610
-Terrible I nearly got my mom’s crοuches last week

335
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:29,450
because I can’t stand the pain is so bad to the hill of my right foot.

336
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:36,290
I usually crouch for the first half hour in the morning…

337
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:48,690
-Did you understand my question? My question was do you have the pain

338
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:54,440
immediately on waking or after rising and stepping down?

339
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:00,270
-Waking and stepping down out of bed. In the past I had pain in bed,

340
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:10,460
sleeping but now that it’s out of the toe I can sleep very good and don’t feel the pain.

341
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,230
-And you feel mostly…

342
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:42,610
-It’s all in the heel, on the right foot, no pain in the toes,

343
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:53,600
so when I walk I use the toes, it’s severely in the toe areas, at the base of my toes

344
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:59,550
and on the outside of the big toe and on the inside of the small toe…

345
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:33,420
-Unless you walk there is no pain. As you sit there, there is pain?

346
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:41,900
-If I just sit here I know I have pain in my body but I know when move it.

347
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:16,540
-What kind of pain it is? Can you describe the pain?

348
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:23,020
-Because I want to be sure, you describe it very well in your book on page 57,

349
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:27,040
I can just read that.
-No, no.

350
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,120
-Do you want me to read that?

351
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,850
-No, no, I want you to forget that and describe your feelings?

352
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:41,370
-All right, you can imagine because I can do this very well if you can imagine.

353
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:48,110
I want you to imagine getting up and walking away, you are on a bridge about 30-40 feet,

354
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:54,780
you jump, there is no water, you land on a rock about this big, right on it.

355
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:21,370
Partly bruised, almost broken, pain on the right foot. It feels just broken, sharp pain.

356
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:35,760
-You have said about applying warm, it alleviates the pain somewhat or quite a lot?

357
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:45,930
-I just bother to put my feet in warm water because soaking and it does feel good

358
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:51,760
and the movement and I get up. When I wake up in the morning

359
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:56,870
and I go to my kitchen in cold it’s really aggravated.

360
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,760
-You like the cold in general?

361
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:16,540
-I like cold weather, I’m a cold person. I get uptight in the heat.

362
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:26,570
-In the place where you live heat is very bad?

363
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:34,070
-You have to have a pool so you can live. We don’t have a pool yet, so we’re barely living.

364
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:46,990
At the time I developed this was in a December, when the toe started blowing up,

365
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:55,830
it was in a winter time and I thought this is going to get better since the sunshine starts.

366
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:06,830
I know it’s  gonna heal that, just because of the sun but in the summer the heat came and…

367
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:25,580
-It didn’t but it’s a wet heat.
-It's dry, you just sweat.

368
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:42,570
-Can anybody describe to me her character, how she feels?

369
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:55,090
-Maybe she likes you.
-Paranoiac.

370
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:04,600
If you want to be good homeopaths, do not get involved emotionally with your patients.

371
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:18,480
When your patient comes, how are you, all this and showing a kind of affection and love

372
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:21,070
and things like that, no.

373
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:31,050
You are an observer and you must understand what the defense mechanism is doing

374
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:32,300
and presenting to you.

375
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,880
You will never understand if you get involved emotionally with the person, forget it.

376
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:41,980
You like very much a woman when she comes? You better send her to another doctor.

377
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:49,380
Say, I like you too much, you better go to another doctor. Otherwise you failure.

378
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:58,130
You are going to fail and a woman who likes the doctor

379
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:02,710
and because most of you are young doctors, they try to seduce the doctor

380
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:04,960
in order to pay more attention.

381
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:11,700
This is the biggest mistake that the patient is making because if the doctor is really seduced,

382
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:17,630
can not find the remedy. Forget it. I can give you a guarantee about that.

383
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:24,240
Once you get involved emotionally, you can not see objectively anymore. The objectivity is finished.

384
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:33,890
I had a case with one woman doctor in our Center, she sent me a case.

385
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:41,380
It is a young man with certain problems and he is a nice man and she describes the man…

386
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:46,570
I read the case and I say… oh.

387
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:55,500
She is a very good looking woman and the patient is coming, he is a very good looking young man.

388
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,820
She writes I had a very good rapport and she reported the rapport she had between her and him,

389
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:04,070
that was she was reporting. I say, what is the disease?

390
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:07,970
What he is suffering from, you better take again the case.

391
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:14,250
Because I saw this was most probably a mental case and she had missed it completely.

392
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:23,070
So she calls back the patient and they discuss and she calls also the relatives of the patient

393
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:29,170
and this was a complete mental case, it was a manic depressive case.

394
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:37,070
He came in the state of mania and they are very nice people and she had a rapport,

395
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:45,060
she liked him and she wrote it down, he is a very nice man, good looking etc.

396
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,320
She was reporting objectively! She did not see anything of what he was having,

397
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:54,060
she was not reporting any mental symptom. He had some pimples here and there.

398
00:50:54,160 --> 00:51:03,650
I mean why this man came? Some hints in the case, I said no that is not the case,

399
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,830
this is something else.

400
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:18,050
Always again and again that’s a fact, so at least you know it. You don’t have an excuse now.

401
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,340
Nobody described to me her character. Anyhow let’s see a bit more.

402
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:58,830
Why she does this? Why she looks in this way? Try to observe, try to be there.

403
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,990
-It’s timidity?

404
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:08,140
-In the night when you go to bed your feet will be cold, will be warm?

405
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,480
-They are pretty warm.

406
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:22,390
-I ask you because you have to learn to observe. Her eyes do they look at you?

407
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:33,060
You are the examiner, do they look at you straight? Not straight. What happens with her eyes?

408
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:46,330
Does she look? There is haziness in her look. Her look is not straight.

409
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:59,890
Why there is this haziness? Why she plays with her eyes? It becomes pathetic, do you see?

410
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:01,990
What is this?

411
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:07,140
She likes herself. Does she like herself?
-Yes.

412
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:13,640
-You can see that. Does she see through? Is she present here now? No she is not.

413
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:20,300
There is a kind of mist. Why this mist? Because she wants to believe things

414
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:27,890
that are not there and that’s why she puts up that mist. I’m so good looking.

415
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:35,410
-Drugs?
-She doesn’t do drugs, no.

416
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:42,550
She is moralistic, she will not have an extramarital affair, you can see it

417
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:50,120
but in order to overcome the reality, what is happening as problems in her life,

418
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:55,970
it becomes a kind of mist, she can not see that, I’m so good looking…

419
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:05,730
And she does not want to show the problems, she puts up a facade.

420
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:13,890
-Hot shower and then my shoes on…

421
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:23,400
-You see the façade? What is this?

422
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:45,780
-So it was time for you this morning after rising? It was always like that?

423
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:54,970
-No. The whole thing is ever-changing  I told a few months ago

424
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:59,620
and it just never stopped changing and the fact that I see little improvement

425
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:04,140
gives me no hope anymore because it blows up somewhere else.

426
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:11,630
-Why do you feel about your condition?
-What I feel about it?

427
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:15,050
-Do you feel that you’ll never get well?

428
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:21,550
-I used to feel great confidence in my ability to heal myself but I lost it

429
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:28,890
because I’m not healing and the improvement is not getting anywhere near …

430
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,130
-When you say to heal myself, you meant by the sheer force of the will

431
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:38,130
that you could really do better?
-Yes.

432
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:43,380
If one is in good shape and good health should be able to heal himself.

433
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:58,900
I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I eat right, I do all these, I had the ability to…

434
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:07,900
this and I’ve lost it. I might be dying slow I don’t know, I might have cancer.

435
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:10,050
-You have real fears now?

436
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:15,980
-Yes I think about that all the time. I probably have and I’m gonna cry.

437
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:28,060
I can’t get better and it’s killing me not to die than to die in 10 years painfully.

438
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:34,710
-Perhaps you overdid it. Most probably…

439
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:43,480
-I’ll kill you…
-I don’t blame you.

440
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:53,150
-You probably got too much… you probably did too many good things and I’m a rag, that’s not fair.

441
00:56:56,150 --> 00:57:01,540
-But I’m glad we are all learning from our mistakes.

442
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:07,390
-I haven’t made any mistakes, no. I haven’t learnt anything from that.

443
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:16,960
You are learning and to learn from that now. I’m just playing humble.

444
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:24,370
-Do you belong to a religious kind of group?
-Yes, I’m fine.

445
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:25,570
-And you are fine?

446
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:35,220
-I’m fine. I’m a well adjusted balanced person.

447
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:47,460
-Why did she get ill? She did all the right things? What she did wrong?

448
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:12,710
Unfortunately in this case you are not able to really talk about deeper problems perhaps

449
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:25,370
that she has faced and it is my feeling, my understanding but I can’t prove it,

450
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:34,390
that she did not want to see reality, she did not want to see the real problems and face them.

451
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:45,050
She put up a façade. She tried to make everything in order, to be everything intact,

452
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:55,120
very correct but in a deeper level, she must be facing some conflict quite strongly as well.

453
00:58:55,220 --> 00:59:01,370
This is my opinion. I don’t say because of that conflict we have the manifestation of the disease.

454
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:05,680
I cant’ say that either but what I’m interested is how the whole thing

455
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:10,470
is reacting in mental-emotional and physical level as well.

456
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:17,870
It appears to me that she is covering up some problems that exist in her life

457
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:27,560
by trying to put a complete order into her life, by having complete order, doing the right thing.

458
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:33,370
She is religious, she is sitting correctly, she has a good husband, the family is correct,

459
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:37,480
the children must go to school and be the first etc.

460
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:45,110
The organism does not work in this way always. We can not force our organism

461
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:53,950
to work in such an order but the Arsenicum case have they have this desire to be orderly.

462
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:57,870
How deep is with Arsenicum, everything has to be in order.

463
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:04,120
When we say fastidious, do you understand the element of fastidiousness

464
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:14,620
and how from a tremendous self confidence comes the idea of death into the picture?

465
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:20,700
How comes the idea of anxiety? I’m losing my health, am I having cancer?

466
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:25,490
Fear of cancer and then we develop fear of cancer in Arsenicum.

467
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:31,890
Anxiety about health, fear of cancer, fear of death, which are the main things.

468
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:41,490
Despair of recovery and at the same time she is having fear of microbes and germs and phobias.

469
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:52,870
When the Arsenicum will be given, she is going to have a big reaction in her toes

470
01:00:52,970 --> 01:01:02,980
and her inflammations definitely but later on what’s going to happen is,

471
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:10,720
and I don’t have any more information about the case, but I believe it’s going to break out

472
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,750
with a strong eruption.

473
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,880
Eventually everything will come into the surface and will come as an eruption

474
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:25,460
and when there is an eruption, it’s going to be quite strong and quite bothering the doctor.

475
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,310
I don’t know how he is going to handle it.

476
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:37,470
-Do you have a vertigo from high places?

477
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:48,900
-I have developed it. I didn’t use to. Only extreme heights, climbing a mountain.

478
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:33,130
Red, dry, cracking, it’s really bad so we went to doctor and I guess that came out…

479
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:44,880
I don’t remember any specific…  I wash my hands so much because I’m obsessed

480
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:52,730
for germs and clean house and so I still do that, just as much and I don’t have a hand problem.

481
01:02:56,150 --> 01:03:03,730
-How long you had this skin eruption?
-Maybe a year.

482
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:09,560
-Only a year?
-Just coming on and off.

483
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:19,730
-When your feet started hurting you, what is the connection with the eruption?

484
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:23,780
-It’s six years ago.

485
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,030
-Six years ago you started with the eruption?

486
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:35,530
-Yes six or seven years. I’m married eight years and it started somewhere

487
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:42,280
when I got married and somewhere when I got the babies, I can’t remember exactly.

488
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:45,500
-How many babies did you have?
-Four.

489
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:54,100
-You can’t remember when it came, four or three years ago?

490
01:03:54,200 --> 01:04:01,360
-After my second baby, that was six years ago.

491
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:09,030
-And the feet started hurting?
-Last October.

492
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,790
-When did you start washing your hands?
-When I got married.

493
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:23,700
When I started caring for my own home, cleaning my own toilet, cleaning the house, doing all that.

494
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,930
Washing my hands before make dinner, then used to make dinner,

495
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:30,790
I used to have my mom making dinner…

496
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:42,440
-I see. How many times you wash your hands? 30 times or 100 times the day?

497
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:55,180
-… Before I comb my hair,  before I get the food, after I go to the bathroom, it’s all day long.

498
01:04:57,430 --> 01:05:04,090
-You never had this impulse to do this thing before you get married or you did it very little?

499
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:06,190
-Very little.

500
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:16,350
-What this washing of the hands has to do with the marriage?

501
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:25,420
She said, I started washing my hands after my marriage.

502
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,780
What the marriage has to do with the washing?

503
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:40,020
-Mental illness?
-Syphilis?

504
01:05:48,270 --> 01:06:07,180
-I think you carry the idea of miasm a bit too far. No. I’d like to hear some other.

505
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:24,690
What has happened in her marriage? What happened in her sexual life?

506
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:46,000
Most probably why the situation has come about? Because genetically

507
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:51,850
she was having the after effect of syphilis.

508
01:06:54,350 --> 01:07:01,110
When this genetic predisposition will appear after a stress…

509
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:11,920
Why the marriage became a stress? She must have been wealthy before, her father providing,

510
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:15,430
her mother doing all these works, never did anything.

511
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:23,410
Then she comes to the marriage situations and she develops that disgust

512
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:26,520
and this fear of microbes.

513
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:32,170
Most probably what she says it is right. I couldn’t confirm.

514
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:35,090
With these cases you don’t play tricks.

515
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:41,920
She is not in a position to ask such questions, whether she likes the husband

516
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:44,180
or she does not like him.

517
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:49,160
It is out of question because all these things have been pushed into the subconscious.

518
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:54,510
It s not even in her conscious mind I believe.

519
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:59,720
That’s why I will not push her to discover these things.

520
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:09,930
What I want to understand is the situation where it has arrived, what is the genetic predisposition

521
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:12,000
and whether syphilis is there.

522
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:16,770
Most probably according to our theories, they are coming down through

523
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:25,500
and therefore choosing an antisyphilitic remedy which confirms again the choice of Arsenicum,

524
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:28,850
being syphilitic remedy.

525
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:37,100
But most probably the stress is there and some disgust came about after the marriage.

526
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:45,750
-After you delivered your baby do you remember getting any medicine to this period,

527
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:49,250
before getting married?
-No.

528
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:50,840
-During the first year of your marriage,

529
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:56,840
did you get any medicine?
-Maybe cortisone creams.

530
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:58,830
-Why, because of…

531
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:09,670
-Cortisone for lotion without having an eruption?

532
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:15,920
-No, I have the eruption and he maybe recommended this type of cream.

533
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:24,000
-After the eruption but I’m talking before. You were never sick in your life?

534
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:29,590
-And taking pills for it? No.

535
01:09:29,690 --> 01:09:32,840
-Never you had fever?

536
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:42,370
-I had aspirin, I had strep and take something for that.

537
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:46,120
-What? Antibiotics?
-Probably.

538
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:51,620
-When did you have this strep?
-I had it three years ago.

539
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,130
-I’m talking before marriage.

540
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:57,700
-I know, I never had taken vacations for anything.

541
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,700
-So you were very healthy as a child?
-Yes.

542
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:11,800
-You don’t remember yourself being sick?
-No. I got mono in College.

543
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:24,800
-She got mononucleosis and she went through it without taking medicines.

544
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:36,070
She talks in a particular tone of voice. It is an American tone of talking

545
01:10:36,170 --> 01:10:43,030
but still there is something that is impressive in her talking.

546
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:46,630
 Can anybody tell me why she talks in this way?

547
01:10:48,140 --> 01:11:01,890
-Tension.
-She is shy.

548
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:15,040
-She is talking like that. When you talk from here…

549
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:27,130
What is the difference when somebody speaks from the heart? The voice comes from deeper.

550
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:37,960
When the voice is… it’s a way of hiding the emotions and what you feel.

551
01:11:39,310 --> 01:11:45,770
Mostly Americans they found this way of getting away with their emotions.

552
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:52,020
They say, emotions are no good, they talk like that from here upwards, only with the head

553
01:11:52,120 --> 01:12:01,980
and with the voice, not with the heart. This is the idea, the monotonous.

554
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:12,370
The voice comes only from here, that part. It’s only the intellect.

555
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:19,710
You can’t do things like that to your system, you are going to pay one way or another.

556
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:29,940
You can’t constantly suppress your emotions and… I did everything the right thing.

557
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:40,210
It’s a superficial layer on which you live. The rest of the organism what happens?

558
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:47,060
You are going to ignore everything and say you are living nicely?

559
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:57,850
All these grimaces and the way she talks, is a superficial level of life,

560
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:00,860
ignoring completely what is happening in deeper level.

561
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,290
Now you have the effect, now you come to fix it.

562
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:14,430
Why do I say that? Because apart from Homeopathy, we give a remedy

563
01:13:14,530 --> 01:13:17,190
and we say this is your remedy, take it.

564
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:27,770
What we are dealing with all the time are complex problems.

565
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:35,480
Not just the pain, take a pill, the pain is gone, fixed, no.

566
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:40,980
Homeopathy has the possibility of making this woman talk from the heart.

567
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:47,480
You saw the other Arsenicum case? How she talks from the heart eventually?

568
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:52,490
It was impossible for her to think of talking from the heart, where the voice broke down

569
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:57,330
and the emotions came and she broke down, she spoke from the heart.

570
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:03,980
Now the same is going to happen with her but the problem is quite complex.

571
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,420
She has to solve the problem she is facing.

572
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:13,170
And what is the problem she is facing? Most probably is what she mentioned.

573
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:22,900
A good husband who provides but on another level dissatisfaction

574
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:31,140
and we cover this up with…  a voice which is completely at the surface, with a life

575
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,870
which is completely on the surface.

576
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:37,070
Everything I do right, everything I do right.

577
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:44,320
I can’t imagine how a person can say, I did everything right. I can’t even imagine.

578
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:50,950
If there is a little bit of self examination, you will reveal 10 mistakes every hour.

579
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:59,020
Let’s say she does not make 10 mistakes, she makes 2 or 3 but she does nothing?

580
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:06,220
You see, she does not see in depth what is taking place and now she comes to us

581
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:13,080
to be treated and we have to understand all these problems.

582
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:16,230
And we are going to do, divorce her husband?

583
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:21,480
No, this is not a solution for her, she will never accept that solution

584
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:27,230
but she has to understand that not everything is perfect in this life.

585
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:33,960
That things in this life you have sometimes to make concessions, to make room for others,

586
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:40,310
to make room for your ideas that come very strictly.

587
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:54,500
So the task of a homeopath I see it as much deeper and much more profound

588
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:59,850
than just relieving pains or relieving anxieties.

589
01:16:00,850 --> 01:16:06,240
It is a task of bringing real order to the organism, not external order.

590
01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:10,340
Arsenicum is happy with the external order of things.

591
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:19,830
There was a big aggravation in this case.

592
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:28,660
Very severe aggravation and the last day of the seminar, it was actually an aggravation of 7 days,

593
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:34,810
the last day of the seminar the doctor gave a report saying

594
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:39,320
that she is starting feeling better in her pains.

595
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:43,740
In the main aggravation she stayed in bed for several days, she could not get up at all

596
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:51,780
and by the end of the seminar, it was 7-8 days after giving the remedy,

597
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,970
the doctor has reported an amelioration already.

598
01:16:55,070 --> 01:17:00,730
It was a severe aggravation as it was predicted and everybody can see

599
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:02,970
that this is an Arsenicum case.

600
01:17:03,070 --> 01:17:06,820
You see the elements of Arsenicum quite strongly.

601
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:12,720
-Why she got that severe aggravation?

602
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:21,840
-According to my understanding what she has is a severe pathology.

603
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:30,740
Why it is a severe pathology? I don’t know, I can’t give a name to her pathology.

604
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:38,490
But taking into consideration what is happening in the whole organism, the phobias,

605
01:17:38,590 --> 01:17:44,730
the cleanliness, the predisposition that comes from syphilitic background,

606
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:53,230
taking into consideration the emotional closeness and what has been suppressed,

607
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:59,550
I feel that all that when it comes out, this pathology is going to be very severe.

608
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:07,300
It comes out as a state of arthritis, whatever arthritis it may be,

609
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:13,490
even rheumatoid arthritis is not very severe case but I believe that here we have a case

610
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:17,230
which is even worse than rheumatoid arthritis.

611
01:18:17,330 --> 01:18:20,740
That’s why I say the pathology is strong and she is going to have a big the aggravation

612
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:22,330
and she did have.
