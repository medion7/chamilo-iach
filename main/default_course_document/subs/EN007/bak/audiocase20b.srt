1
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,720
-Before your disease were you ever depressed or suicidal?

2
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:37,730
-No, I loved to live.

3
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:45,620
-What it was like to be in an orphanage when you were 10 years old?

4
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,370
Why you were there?

5
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:57,670
-Because my mother couldn’t take care of me anymore. She was out in the country.

6
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:04,480
-His mother was in an Indian.

7
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:10,810
-She was Red Indian. American Indian.

8
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:17,810
-What it was like to be in an orphanage? Do you remember your emotions?

9
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,570
-Hell.

10
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,900
-Why?

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,390
-You were 13 years old when you run away. Why it was hell? What did they do?

12
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:38,140
-Just read the newspaper.

13
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:47,990
-It was a lot of sexual abuse in these places, they’ve been finding out about and physical

14
00:01:48,090 --> 00:02:02,590
abuse in these orphanages.

15
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:21,240
-Now that you remember this and you wanted to cry or no?

16
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,730
-Yes.

17
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,740
-Some crying came.

18
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,110
-Yes.

19
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:36,690
-Did you have any feeling, any constriction in your throat?

20
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:42,900
-Yes, of course.

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:53,280
-Do you ever experience any kind of a lump in your throat, like if there is a lump that you

22
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,040
try to swallow and the lump stays?

23
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:06,520
-Almost permanently a sensation of a lump, I have to do many times. I’m not doing it too much

24
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:27,350
because the therapist teaches me how not to do it. He told me not to do it.

25
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,720
-To take it away he has to swallow the sensation of the lump in the throat.

26
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:44,520
-Do I answer your question fully? Yes I don’t want to talk about it but the reason is not

27
00:03:44,620 --> 00:04:01,270
that, it is that you may not be familiar but there is a big enquiry going on now and I’m part

28
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,770
of the group who is suing the government.

29
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,720
-He is part of a group that suing the government right now because of what happened in

30
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:17,430
this orphanage. So I don’t want to speak too much about it.

31
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:20,770
-Can you say what is going with the emotions?

32
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:28,270
-Because of the treatment that was going on there, I was not aware of what they were

33
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:35,520
doing but someone came to see me and say, why don’t you join us to help us with new

34
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:44,370
people. I said OK.

35
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,630
-He finally agreed to be part of this group to take on the government.

36
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,660
-For me the past is the past...

37
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,630
-He tries to forget the past.

38
00:04:53,730 --> 00:05:00,290
-It is the way it was then and if people didn’t like it, the only way was to jump over the

39
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:07,900
fence and run. Life is like that. The disease is the same thing.

40
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,230
You don’t ask for it, it just happens.

41
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,630
-For legal reasons you can’t speak right now?

42
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:31,900
-No, I could speak but I want to stress that I had forgotten about all these things but all

43
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:45,660
these meeting we had, start meeting about this bad treatment, I wanted to forget this and

44
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:55,910
now it’s more than what they did then…

45
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:09,660
-It didn’t hurt so much at the time but now when he hears other stories it hurts a lot more.

46
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:17,490
-You have kids, I don’t want this thing to happen to them and now people are talking,

47
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,990
they are crazy about them and this has been happening for 25 years,

48
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:35,770
maybe it is still happening, there is nothing I can do about…  and nobody is doing anything.

49
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,490
-Nobody is doing anything so that’s why you’ve decided to participate?

50
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:49,230
There is still happening.

51
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:56,070
This type of abuse that was happening in this orphanage, it’s still happening.

52
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,440
You are concerned about that?

53
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:10,520
-Of course I am. But I don’t think it has any bearing.

54
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,260
-You don’t think it has any bearing.

55
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:22,520
-No, because all these days my feeling about this, I didn’t know about it. If you are born in

56
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:32,350
a cage and they bit you then that’s life.

57
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:49,600
-But I think what I had to go through in there prepared me to be what I am…

58
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:58,430
-That prepared him and gave him the guts to do something in his life.

59
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:07,760
-I don’t think it has any bearing of what is happening to me today.

60
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,770
-He doesn’t think it has any bearing with the way he is today.

61
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:22,340
-Not to say I’m quite conservative. I just said that’s me and maybe someone can do

62
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,200
something.

63
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,450
-I see.

64
00:08:51,190 --> 00:09:00,090
-When the people started asking you to participate in this and you started reading the

65
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:04,850
stories about what happened to other people, when was this?

66
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:19,340
-Some of the people involved, came two years ago, there was an enquiring and for some

67
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:32,100
reason some documents had to come out. One of the guys there, he is a friend of mine,

68
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,760
he said I know you know some people in the right places, can you help us? I said I do

69
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,100
whatever I can. So I phoned some people and they did something about.

70
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:50,350
-He called some people in the government.

71
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:06,680
-There is a lot of news about this kind of situations. When did you first read about it?

72
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:22,680
-For 5 years now the case is coming out. Now it’s coming out every day.

73
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:30,510
-Do you recall your feelings when you first started reading about those cases?

74
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:42,350
-I did not want to talk about them. The way I look at it is maybe different like the way I

75
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:59,850
took the disease. People tell me that I’m crazy but to me the abuse and my view I’ve

76
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:15,180
been involved with the case, life is not an easy thing. Maybe for you it was but for the

77
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:23,430
poor people they have to find the way. Life is tougher and tougher and like now I’m

78
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:32,540
always happy to be sick and have a pension for the rest of my life.

79
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:45,850
So I’m not through of what happened in the past. I don’t think it hurt me that bad.

80
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:53,840
-When it was originally diagnosed that he is having ALS, does he know the laboratory

81
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:57,340
Tests were done that he had and have any idea about the findings?

82
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,100
-Yes, it’s all here if you want to read it.

83
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,600
-Does he have the laboratory picture?

84
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,590
-It seems to be 80% conclusive, not 100%.

85
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:17,680
-Did they do a scan of the spinal cord or just the blood tests?

86
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:28,600
-He has been to 5 specialists.

87
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,850
-All of them have agreed?

88
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,520
-They all agreed?

89
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,260
-Yes, they all agreed.

90
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,510
-Nobody knows my doctor,

91
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:55,510
his name is Jeffrey Ruben and he is probably known as the best neurological doctor

92
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:07,510
about the disease, to show you...

93
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:20,760
He didn’t know then but he gave me a name and it was my doctor but they sent me to

94
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,090
other people.

95
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,430
-He says it is very conclusively diagnosed that he has an ALS.

96
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:34,680
-Did you ever have any skin eruption, any eczema?

97
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:49,470
-About 10 years ago, I had a small spot on my nose, it wouldn’t go away like sun paper

98
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,970
but then it went away.

99
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:56,720
-Just by itself? You didn’t put any cream or cortisone?

100
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:05,220
-I’m against all these things. I didn’t take any medication until now, nothing. Not even an

101
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,720
aspirin.

102
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,970
-Except of the cramping. –Yes.

103
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,220
-They just come and go.

104
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:22,220
-They had prescribed me something to control the laughing and the crying but I didn’t

105
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:31,220
take them because …

106
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,220
-He is not taking any drugs.

107
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:50,970
-Nothing, I’m OK. I look OK. I’m only handicap.

108
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:56,500
-Does he have any nightmares or dreams about this time?

109
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:09,010
-That question has been asked at least a 100 time. No.

110
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:17,420
-He has no bad dreams about the past, no nightmares.

111
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:32,180
-I’ll ask some more questions concerning his reaction to weather, whether is a person

112
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:39,680
who feels very much the cold or very much the heat. How is your reaction to weather?

113
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,710
-I prefer cold weather.

114
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:54,930
-I want to ask your desire for any kind of food. Do you have a desire for food?

115
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,430
-Fish.

116
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:02,170
-All kinds of fish?

117
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:20,430
-Anything that comes from the sea. Of course salt.

118
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,930
-Strong desire for salt.

119
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:27,900
-Salty things like salty sardines?

120
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:47,240
-Yes, I love them. Any kind of sardines I will eat them. The best ones are the Portugese.

121
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:53,010
-When you are in a restaurant and you are eating before tasting your food, will you take

122
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,070
the salt and put salt?

123
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,060
-Yes.

124
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:18,570
-Very good, we start all over again. What about meat? You eat meat?

125
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:25,400
-Yes, I would prefer pork.

126
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,150
-Do you like the fat which goes with pork?

127
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,150
-Most of it.

128
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:45,400
-That’s why you eat it… You like to have some fat.

129
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,160
How much thirst do you have? Are you very thirsty, you drink a lot?

130
00:17:51,260 --> 00:18:01,150
-Not very thirsty. Now I drink because I’m a bit stressed, this is not something I do every

131
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,900
day.

132
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:17,900
-He has an aversion to beef and to meat in general, he doesn’t like meat.

133
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:26,700
-Unless it’s alive.

134
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,540
-Do you mean…?

135
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,120
-Women.

136
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:41,400
-He likes women. Of course who does not?

137
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:51,650
-There are some people.

138
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,450
-Tapioka he doesn’t like.

139
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,450
-What?

140
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,450
-Tapioka. Do you know Tapioka?

141
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,280
-No.

142
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,530
-It is a kind of a pudding.

143
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,570
-Forget it.

144
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:05,930
-Terrible.

145
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,320
-Sweets? –Not very much.

146
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:19,820
-Ice cream? –Yes.

147
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,080
-Every day?

148
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,330
–No. After a good meal.

149
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:32,780
-What about fears? Do you have any fear? Fear of dark, fear of being alone in the

150
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:40,160
house, fear of thunderstorms, fear of animals, fear that somebody is behind you, any

151
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:46,200
type of fear, fear of high places?

152
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,910
-Nothing.

153
00:19:51,130 --> 00:20:25,320
-Can you zoom on his thenar [thumb], on his left. This is typical, as you know, of ALS.

154
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:33,160
Anybody that wants to ask some questions? To look for something.

155
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,150
He wants to look at the tongue.

156
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:43,660
Why do you bite the tongue? Don’t bite it, let it without biting it.

157
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,910
-It makes a spasm by itself when he puts his tongue out.

158
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:59,500
-I can’t do it.

159
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:08,000
-Is any salivation in the night during sleep?

160
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:22,020
-At one point I used to wake up and be very very dry, now I do.

161
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,080
-But not excessive?

162
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:28,580
-No.

163
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:36,080
-Anybody wants more questions?

164
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,200
-It was any trembling?

165
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:52,160
-No, the tongue seemed convoluted like in a permanent spasm.

166
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:58,410
-Your thirst is for cold drinks?

167
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:05,200
-Yes. I would prefer my beers coming out from the cellar.

168
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,770
To answer his question…

169
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:25,500
-Fibrillation of the muscles, there is a little bit of fasciculation in the tongue and the

170
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:35,000
muscles like when you go to grab something.

171
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:51,020
-I have to be careful. I’m lucky. For some reason it works, not always.

172
00:22:51,120 --> 00:23:01,760
-You told us that cold weather... I’d like to know if you are worse …

173
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,500
-Are you worse in warm wet weather or dry wet weather?

174
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,250
-I feel better in cold weather.

175
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:32,340
-What is the worse for you? Dry hot?

176
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:46,170
-Hot and humid. I have some difficulty in breathing. The breathing is part of the disease.

177
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:08,000
-If I was a stranger on the street and met him and showed that I felt sorry for him…

178
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,090
-If people are sympathetic towards you and give you consolation,

179
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,830
 does it a fact that effect you either way?

180
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:22,840
-First of all if you were in the street and you would be sympathetic to my disease, I would

181
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:31,090
be very surprised because almost nobody, even some doctors, know about the disease.

182
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:41,590
Secondly I would appreciate very much your concern.

183
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:48,170
-We have to thank you for your presentation.

184
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,520
-Thank you very much.

185
00:24:54,470 --> 00:25:08,120
-This case reminds us of several remedies. Lathyrus sativus, Plumbum metallicum,

186
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:36,930
Thalium, Causticum, Lachesis, Cuprum, Cocullus, Natrum muriaticum, Ignatia…

187
00:25:37,030 --> 00:26:01,080
What is the remedy? I’d like to discuss the prognosis of the case first. Is he gone?

188
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:10,940
This disease is like most chronic diseases, they appear in different forms of severity.

189
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:19,940
So if you go to the books and you read about ALS, they will give you a span of at the

190
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:29,940
most 5 years of survival. This kind of disease has 5 years of survival because then the

191
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:38,940
cerebellum is affected, there is no way of breathing or for swallowing and they die.

192
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:45,850
Sometimes they put them on artificial respiration and that is how they may survive a few

193
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:52,820
more years. Another characteristic of the disease, for those who are not familiar very

194
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:58,330
much or they don’t remember very much of their neurology, is that the disease on the

195
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:04,490
latest stages starts having severe cramps.

196
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:12,360
So a characteristic whether this kind of disease has progressed to a further stage, to a

197
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:21,830
progressive stage is the amount of cramps that they get. They get tremendous cramps,

198
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:32,080
which are very painful and they usually have to take a lot of pain killers, which speeds up

199
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:41,080
the process of deterioration and then they are finished.

200
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:50,730
So the prognosis is really very bad. He has progressed already to a progress stage of his

201
00:27:50,830 --> 00:28:03,980
disease and so the disease is in its last stage.

202
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:19,180
But in his case there is a ‘but’ and if I had seen another case in that stage, I would give

203
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:32,290
very little hope for improvement, even little improvement and the improvement could only

204
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:48,700
be around the idea of pain. The pain could be reduced.

205
00:28:49,450 --> 00:29:03,090
Not in his case. In his case I’m a little bit more optimistic, why? Can anybody tell me why

206
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:06,340
I’m more optimistic about this case?

207
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:16,840
-Because so far, so good and he is a lucky guy.

208
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:26,470
-I don’t go by luck, if I go by luck maybe I find that I don’t have luck but the mind is clear,

209
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:33,930
so this could give a good prognosis. In a way you may be right.

210
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:38,930
-I was going to add to that also that because in this case the disease seems to get to a

211
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:46,930
certain stage and then stop and it’s almost like the body itself is limiting the disease

212
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:52,440
process.

213
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:59,460
-Unfortunately by itself the vital force will not hold very much because it is a progressing

214
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:06,250
disease, a chronic disease and even if it appears to be for the last 6 months, as he says,

215
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:19,050
a kind of steadiness, still we can not hope for that reason. There is another reason for

216
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:23,550
which I’m a bit hopeful.

217
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:28,040
-If I understand well, he hasn’t taken any medicine.

218
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:34,750
-Yes but in this kind of disease there is no allopathic medicine.

219
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:43,260
For pain he could have taken some medicine.

220
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,510
-His medical story seems clear, he didn’t have any strong disease, he has been a healthy

221
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:57,360
person up to now.

222
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:15,510
-There is only one reason why I say there is hope and the reason is because his remedy,

223
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:24,860
the indicated remedy is clear.

224
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:36,040
Many times I have done predictions like that in front of the camera, so anybody could

225
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:47,100
catch me and say, what did you say? Look. So if I take chances like that…

226
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:56,850
That means the remedy is clear. Out of the remedies which I mentioned, which one or

227
00:31:56,950 --> 00:32:05,090
there is another remedy perhaps, outside of these remedies which is the real remedy?

228
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:18,020
That is the problem I pose in front of you to solve it for me.

229
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:25,180
I used to play tricks in old times where I’d take one remedy, I’d prove that this is the

230
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,670
remedy, the whole class would agree and then I’d say no and then take another remedy,

231
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:35,180
prove the remedy and say no.

232
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:46,090
What we spoke in the beginning, where we said, it depends where you put your focus of

233
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,680
attention.

234
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:59,150
If your is on the wrong place, then you may draw the wrong conclusions.

235
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:05,540
I will give you an example and you will understand what I mean.

236
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:16,090
In this case anybody can argue that this a case of Natrum muriaticum? Why?

237
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:23,180
Because the man has been through a lot of grief, because he lost his parents, he had

238
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:36,760
been incarcerated in the orphanage, he had been molested and hurt and there is real

239
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,600
feelings inside him.

240
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:47,850
The moment that he spoke about this experience, his emotions were choked and with the

241
00:33:47,950 --> 00:34:04,100
desire for salt so strong, grief with salt, salty grief as we say, Natrum muriaticum.

242
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,090
But there is a silence in him, he went through this grief and he did not complain, he did

243
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,930
not say anything to anybody.

244
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:19,260
And there is a constriction in the throat and there is a lump in the throat and there we

245
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,260
have Ignatia.

246
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:36,600
And there are fumes that have gone into the body and most probably quite a lot of lead

247
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:43,350
and this person could have been poisoned by ingesting a lot of lead because of the

248
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:49,720
exhaust gases where we live in our societies and because he had been exposed there.

249
00:34:49,820 --> 00:35:00,460
We know that Plumbum causes syndromes similar to what you have seen.

250
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:24,960
And Lathyrus, if you read Lathyrus, so we learn a little bit Materia Medica, it says

251
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:36,040
affects the lateral and arterial columns in the chord, does not produce pain, reflexes

252
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:43,930
always increased, paralytic affections of lower extremities, spastic paralysis, lateral

253
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:59,040
sclerosis, what we he has, infantine paralysis, extremities:

254
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:08,430
tremulus, tottering gait excessive rigidity of legs, spastic gait,

255
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:18,290
knees walk against each other while walking, cramps in legs, worse cold and cold feet,

256
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:27,040
can not extend or cross legs while sitting, myelitis with spastic symptoms,

257
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:37,850
 gluteal muscles and lower limbs emaciated, legs blue; swollen. Is this case?

258
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:47,120
Would you prescribe Lathyrus?

259
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:53,480
If you really know the Materia Medica, you go through a lot of remedies that look like but

260
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:59,730
what is the Similimum? What is the remedy that will touch such case?

261
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:05,780
This case will never be touched by any other remedy except of the Similimum.

262
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:13,790
You have to find it and if you find it there is a possibility of improvement, not only he will

263
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:22,780
steadify in its condition, where he is now and live for several years more but there is a

264
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,110
possibility for improvement.

265
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:40,450
How much improvement? I would say 30% which means you reverse the process of the

266
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:50,450
disease. Fantastic, he may live another 10-15 years if he doesn’t antidote your treatment

267
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,540
which is tremendous.

268
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:01,110
How his leg will be? Much improved, walk better but what you will see definitely and you

269
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:10,650
will compare with this picture that we have today after a year that his speech instead of

270
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:23,860
being worse, will be much better This is a typical speech he has.

271
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:35,470
Of what remedy?

272
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:52,620
When you look upon the case, there are so many symptoms for that first remedy that

273
00:38:52,720 --> 00:39:13,620
comes to your mind that you can not go to another remedy. Which is this remedy?

274
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:23,050
Phosphorus.

275
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:35,200
How many symptoms you have? Seven. Show me this.

276
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:49,980
What is the remedy?

277
00:39:50,080 --> 00:40:08,030
Lachesis. The remedy is Lachesis, a left sided affection with the constriction in the

278
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:16,370
larynx without being able to either swallow, when he says I jump from bed because

279
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:26,870
I’m choked typical Lachesis symptomatology.

280
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:38,610
Then he said he has a lump in the throat from which he swallows. You did not take into

281
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:46,980
consideration that symptom. He had a special training to stop doing that because the

282
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:55,820
feeling of the lump was there all the time and he had to have a special training from the

283
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:04,150
specialists to overcome this and the lump is there, swallow the lump, the lump comes

284
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,300
back.

285
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:20,290
So the sensation not ameliorated by swallowing, Lachesis is very prominent. You can not

286
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:26,280
go away from Lachesis, what is against Lachesis?

287
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:37,400
He sleeps on the right side, he can not sleep on the left but he is not loquacious.

288
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:47,710
Why he is not loquacious and why he is not jealous?

289
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:55,120
I’ve spoken about loquacity of Lachesis and I have said the loquacity of Lachesis comes

290
00:41:55,220 --> 00:42:09,950
about mostly in women. Women like to talk, when there is a Lachesis woman there is

291
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:29,700
something lacking in her and this is replaces by a desire to talk, to talk is to communicate.

292
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:43,200
The desire to communicate in Lachesis is a substitute for a woman who has suppressed

293
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,450
her sexual desire.

294
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:55,650
Lachesis as a remedy is a remedy is with full emotions, full sexuality and a woman who

295
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:03,450
does not express that sexuality because of withdrawals, things are taken inside and are

296
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:20,690
choked here, in the area of the thyroid, the emotions are choked. They do not express.

297
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:28,430
If the mental state is affected, then we have mental symptoms.

298
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:39,970
In this case the mental state is not affected. In spite of the fact that he has been through

299
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:46,270
a lot of suffering in his life, we do not have pathology on the mental level.

300
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:52,020
So if you search for jealousy, you do not search for jealousy like normal jealousy, who

301
00:43:52,120 --> 00:44:02,020
is not jealous, tell me who is not jealous? Put up your hands. One, two, put up your

302
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:13,520
hands. I’m not jealous and I know because I believed that I’m not jealous all my life.

303
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:22,020
To be jealous is normal in what conditions? If you are in love with somebody.

304
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:29,100
Then jealousy manifests. Jealousy does not manifest just by itself.

305
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:36,860
So if you are in love, then you come and tell me if the woman is interested to another

306
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,110
man whether you are jealous or not.

307
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:50,600
But if you are in a normal condition, that means if you are in love you are mad, but if you

308
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:56,970
are in a normal condition and you are healthy, you are not going to be jealous.

309
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:03,720
In Lachesis the jealousy is pathological. That means there is no reason for Lachesis to

310
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:13,270
believe that this man is going with another woman but she believes it. I’ve seen you.

311
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:24,100
When did you see me? When husbands of Lachesis women talk to us, they will say the

312
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:31,850
jealousy is insane because I have never done anything to provoke her jealousy and yet

313
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:35,850
she is jealous all the time. That is pathological jealousy.

314
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:45,050
When we are seeking for pathological jealousy, we have to see that kind of pathology.

315
00:45:45,150 --> 00:46:01,940
But if the man is not in a love state, he may not show jealousy at all, if he is normal.

316
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:12,470
Another state in Lachesis is when you have Lachesis withdrawn inside, feelings inside,

317
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:17,100
then what happens is the jealousy also goes inside.

318
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:24,610
That means is not shown and instead an indifference takes place within the person.

319
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:34,860
Then you see a total indifference but underneath is the snake of jealousy.

320
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:43,350
It goes like a snake inside, eats him up, can not tolerate that feeling and then jealousy

321
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:50,430
feelings go away and are replaced by a state of indifference.

322
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:55,430
That can be Lachesis as well.

323
00:46:55,530 --> 00:47:06,970
This man, if I ask him are you jealous, he says no I’m not. Is this going to hold me back

324
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:16,430
from prescribing Lachesis? Why? Not only that. I know that if somebody gets in this kind

325
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:28,270
of state, then mentally usually is better. So mentally I consider him quite healthy.

326
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:34,130
Maybe you are surprised but mentally and emotionally this man is quite healthy.

327
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:39,940
The fact that he has been through all the suffering in the orphanage…

328
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:48,690
Did you hear what he said? He said by that time I did not pay attention, I thought this is

329
00:47:48,790 --> 00:48:02,050
life. What is there? And if you take it in this way, you can not get sick. If you accept...

330
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:06,800
Can you imagine in Russia, she comes from Russia, all these people suppressed by the

331
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:19,770
Russian police? It’s totally going to jail, going for years in closed places, they would be

332
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:27,270
very sick. Yet if you see some documentaries with them, you see how healthy still they

333
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:31,620
have remained.

334
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:45,520
Why? Because they have accepted, this is the government, what can we do, this is life.

335
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:59,270
For us to put us unjustly in jail, we’ll get sick within 24 hours. Why? Because you can’t

336
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:10,800
accept it but accept it. Go to jail, say the rest of my life here, no disease.

337
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:20,000
For him it was the same thing. It was acceptance, therefore I can not go and give Ignatia

338
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:25,000
or Natrum muriaticum. How do I understand that? From what he says. This is the man,

339
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,880
what he says, I evaluate what he says.

340
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:36,830
And I see all the anger that comes out. There was anger for what has happened but

341
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:44,710
afterwards. After they have come and approached him and told him, look what they are

342
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:53,540
doing to the children. Look what they are doing and this anger is expressed in action. He

343
00:49:53,640 --> 00:50:13,340
takes part in an investigation and he says I want to help so that these people will be

344
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:24,830
punished. His anger is expressed. Therefore I don’t see pathology there.

345
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:33,590
The pathology is so close to the pathology of Lachesis and the organism is giving

346
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:45,090
pathology on physical level. So do not try to find pathology on the mental-emotional in

347
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:52,910
this case. Be happy and I’m very happy with the pathology that is given on the physical

348
00:50:53,010 --> 00:51:00,500
level and I prescribe a remedy, not because of his pathology but because of the totality of

349
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:06,000
the symptoms in the physical pathology.

350
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:11,250
All the symptoms he relates are pathognomonic symptoms of his pathology that

351
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:21,340
constitute in the whole, keynotes of Lachesis.

352
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:32,420
In this case I focus on the information and I see the information is unique, it is peculiar.

353
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:42,410
Peculiar to what remedy? It happens to be all his symptoms peculiar to Lachesis…

354
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:54,260
How can I go away from Lachesis? I have to give Lachesis.

355
00:51:54,360 --> 00:52:10,000
The wasting of the thenar muscle, this is again on the left side. So we have a wasting of

356
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:17,250
the muscle of the left side, which is again Lachesis. Lachesis covers that beautifully.

357
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:25,950
There is no problem with that.

358
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:33,750
-You give Lachesis repeated because it is something that might be very progressively

359
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:41,010
improved. So are you going to tell him to take it once the month? What do you do?

360
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:53,790
-That’s a good question. In such a case where we have such severe pathology, we may

361
00:52:53,890 --> 00:53:03,280
have to stimulate with lower potencies and more frequently.

362
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:18,120
Usually I would like to stimulate with low potency, let us say 12X or 12C every day for a

363
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:30,950
month or two. But I have seen that Lachesis repeatedly given many times produces a

364
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:41,210
kind of proving, it’s easy to prove the symptoms of Lachesis and that’s why in this case I

365
00:53:41,310 --> 00:53:58,020
will try a high potency 200 and if I see that there is improvement and then there is a

366
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:03,080
relapse, even if the relapse is after a month, there is improvement for one month and

367
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:10,090
then starts the relapse, I will repeat. But I will go about in this direction.

368
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:25,120
If now the Lachesis 200 does not give the expected results, then I will go lower in 12 and

369
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:44,360
I will repeat 12C, this is the hundred dilution, every day going up once, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

370
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:53,750
17, 18. I can go as long as I see some improvement, I can continue. If I see aggravation,

371
00:54:53,850 --> 00:55:02,340
I will stop, wait, see the amelioration and then again.

372
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:12,620
-I’d like to make a little comment. This muscle is called dorsal interosseous, I don’t think it

373
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:25,010
matters. This is the thenar muscle.

374
00:55:25,110 --> 00:56:01,740
-Very good. But this is the typical muscle, the dorsal interosseous but the thenar also is

375
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:13,740
affected in this disease. Both muscles are affected. Monkey hand.

376
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:26,740
So can you send me a follow up of the case after 6 months after this treatment in a video

377
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:35,980
where you make him walk, talk and ask him questions, how do you feel in all this respect

378
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:47,850
and then I can advice you further? So it’s a pity to lose such a case, just by making some

379
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:56,480
mistake and the improvement which I foresee that he may have, does not come.

380
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:01,980
It is one of the worse diseases of the human kind.

381
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:17,730
-Can you repeat the dilution as to how you would give 200CH?

382
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:24,560
-Repeat the 200 again, just one dose, wait and then repeat again and then wait.

383
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:29,070
Don’t be too much in a hurry to repeat.

384
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:33,900
-So you wouldn’t take the 12CH after that, like after the 200CH you would not go for…

385
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,150
-No unless there is no effect from the 200, for two months you wait, you see no effect,

386
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:44,650
nothing. Then you start with 12, 13, 14…

387
00:57:44,750 --> 02:01:16,200
-Thank you.
