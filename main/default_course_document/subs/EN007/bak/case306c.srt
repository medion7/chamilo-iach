1
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,730
-You tell us what remedies he had.

2
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:42,720
-In the beginning he had Phos 200 and then he got very high in the blood sugar and

3
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:56,220
after 4 days he got another remedy because it was very bad for him. It was Carcin 200.

4
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,220
-When?

5
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:10,730
-Here in Alonissos 19th of May.

6
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,140
-One year ago.

7
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:27,090
-With the Carc the blood sugar went down to the normal again but he became very tired

8
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:41,860
and he got problems with his knees and his heels. He had this before and he got it again.

9
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:50,360
So he could not play football or do sports and he felt very tired.

10
00:01:50,460 --> 00:02:10,100
-He got some weight, since I saw him last year he is 15 cm higher at least.

11
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,870
What is your height now?

12
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,850
-I don’t know. 1,75.

13
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:31,360
-We have to measure him, before you leave not now. We have to record it, perhaps even

14
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:40,110
20 cm higher.

15
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:47,360
-And because of these problems with his heels he got Pulsatilla.

16
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,810
-Through the fax?

17
00:02:49,910 --> 00:03:00,020
-Yes and with Carc he was very tired and he was standing at home only, he didn’t want to

18
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,410
go out but now he is in a much better energy.

19
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,160
-After Pulsatilla?

20
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,410
-Yes.

21
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,150
-When did he get Pulsatilla, can you give me the date?

22
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:27,920
-In the end of July. Pulsatilla 200.

23
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,910
-One dose?

24
00:03:29,010 --> 00:04:12,900
-One dose.

25
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,900
We had a follow up here in October, he was not here but you asked me and he began to

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:53,910
sigh, he was sighing a lot and he got Ignatia from you in October.

27
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,110
-Ignatia 200?

28
00:04:55,210 --> 00:05:42,580
-No from 15 up to 30, 3 times the day. With this he wanted salt very much.

29
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,570
-He started craving for salt?

30
00:05:44,670 --> 00:06:11,500
-Yes, more than usual. And so in February he got Nat mur 200C and with this he took

31
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:30,250
this in 27th of January and 2 weeks after he had taken the remedy he got a flu and the

32
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:40,740
influenza lasted about 2 weeks and he got fever and he had never had this before.

33
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:53,400
It was up to 39 degrees.

34
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:01,420
-I have problems with all Norwegians, with you it’s double.

35
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,150
-We all have problems with her.

36
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:27,590
-I come from the South. And he was very red on his cheeks and he felt very warm with

37
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,570
this fever.

38
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,080
-No.

39
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,830
-It went for how many days the fever?

40
00:07:37,930 --> 00:08:00,570
-About 4-5 days and he had a very dry coughing and down here on the chest. When we

41
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:19,390
were going to bed he was starting to cough more in the evening. He was not awaken by it

42
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:28,280
-In the meantime you didn’t tell me how many units of insulin he was taking all along this

43
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,620
time.

44
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:38,110
-He did not change, about the same units.

45
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:43,860
-You did not change why? Did you measure the sugar?

46
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:52,370
-Yes.

47
00:08:52,470 --> 00:09:05,200
-It was about 35 units the day.

48
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:15,700
-But what was the level of sugar in the blood?

49
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:26,440
-With Nat mur it can change…

50
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:39,200
-It can change from day to day. In average it was approximately 7,5.

51
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:47,490
-What kind of measurement is this? What is the normal?

52
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,660
-It is between 3,5-6.

53
00:09:51,760 --> 00:10:02,540
-No it’s 8.

54
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:17,210
-She should agree with me, it is between 3,5 and 7,5  that’s the normal.

55
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:26,800
-And his average all this time was 7,5 that means the uppermost to normal rage.

56
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:50,540
-Yes that’s correct. He got to the doctor and he measured it for 2 months.

57
00:10:50,640 --> 00:11:12,540
-Each time Alexander goes to the doctor, he measures the average for last month period.

58
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,960
approximately that.

59
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,130
-Was any time that it was 5?

60
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:38,630
-Not in the average but from day to day it can be from 4 to 15 at the most.

61
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:51,910
-Have you noticed any condition in which the sugar will rise? If he gets upset or he eats

62
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,630
sweets or what?

63
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,120
-If he eats sweets.

64
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,540
-Does he eat a lot of sweets? I’m afraid he is eating much more sweets than usual.

65
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:10,540
-No.

66
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:17,460
-Tell me because we have to make the right conclusions, if we have wrong information

67
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:31,460
we draw wrong conclusions.

68
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:38,960
down and every day he was under 4.

69
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:44,710
-In spite of the fact that he was eating sugar?

70
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,710
-No, then he took sugar.

71
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:58,710
-It was low, he started eating sugar or chocolate?

72
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,620
-Chocolate.

73
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:12,880
-How much? We want to know how much? What was the biggest piece that you ate in

74
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:40,620
one day? From a block of chocolate of that size you will eat half?

75
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:47,870
-Almost all.

76
00:13:47,970 --> 00:14:03,130
-That’s big. The chocolate 20 cm by 10 cm is quite a lot, I don’t eat it myself but anyhow

77
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:15,630
what I want to know is, he grew so much, he increased his eating habits in general?

78
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,570
He ate more than usual?

79
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,040
-Yes he eats a lot.

80
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,540
-So he has very good appetite.

81
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:29,040
-Yes, a lot of fruits, a lot of…

82
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,550
-He eats all kinds of fruits?

83
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:50,040
-Yes he likes fruits very much, oranges, juices and apples, grapes, bananas.

84
00:14:50,140 --> 00:15:01,040
-All sweets, so you forgot that you have a problem with the sugar and just enjoy your life

85
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,540
as I understand.

86
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:12,550
-That’s not correct because what happens if he eats a lot more one day than another day

87
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:19,050
also more fruits than normally, then also he will inject more units of insulin because this is

88
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:26,710
the balance between sugar and that.

89
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:41,210
-So there is some days where you inject let us say 15 units or not? What is the lowest?

90
00:15:41,310 --> 00:16:01,710
-I believe the lowest is 30 a day and the most might be 40.

91
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:23,130
-What is the highest amount of insulin he needed in the past? 50,100,200?

92
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,880
Was ever more than 100 units, he had to take more than 100 units?

93
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,120
-No he hasn’t taken that much.

94
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:51,620
-What do you remember? In the past what was the highest units that you had to inject?

95
00:16:51,720 --> 00:17:01,370
One day you remember I had that day to inject maybe 50 or 60 units.

96
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,570
-50.

97
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:10,240
-The highest I think it was here in Alonissos when he got Phos.

98
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:37,450
-How much?

99
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:46,710
OK you find out and then you tell me, we can proceed now.

100
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:51,960
Does he have any epistaxis from the nose?

101
00:17:52,060 --> 00:18:07,200
-Yes he got after Phos acid. He had one and a half day which comes and goes. Not

102
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:13,370
constantly but a lot of the day.

103
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,620
-No more now.

104
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:24,120
-The epistaxis comes from one side or both sides?

105
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:30,120
-It’s often both.

106
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:37,120
-The desire for chicken is still there or not so much?

107
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,370
-Yes.

108
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:49,050
-The coldness of your hands is still there?

109
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:52,300
-Not there.

110
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,290
-Perspiration in the night?

111
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:07,710
-He is much warmer in the night and the day and he is not so cold. And in the night he

112
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:21,210
takes his feet out of the cover.

113
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:26,210
-Because it’s burning?

114
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:36,210
-Warm.

115
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:40,650
-Generally he is warmer now.

116
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:49,540
-In general how do you see his psychological state, how he is?

117
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:58,040
-I think maybe you will talk now.

118
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:17,210
-His psychology is superb. I think he is very good, a lot of energy, he is positive.

119
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:21,960
-Happy? He studies?

120
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,960
-Yes.

121
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,210
-In the school he is good in the class?

122
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,000
-Yes he is good.

123
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,460
-Very good?

124
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:38,960
-Very good.

125
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,660
-Now how old is he now?

126
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:51,370
-He is 16 in August this year.

127
00:20:51,470 --> 00:21:02,540
-In the beginning, one year ago he was biting his nails.

128
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:12,820
-Yes he uses the scissors very much now.

129
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:21,290
-Ah, I thought he was biting his sister’s nails which would be more interesting!

130
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,790
-He has reason to do it.

131
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:37,990
-All the time he uses this scissors so much.

132
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,700
-You still don’t like the tomatoes?

133
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:47,460
-No.

134
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,700
-You are still afraid of dogs?

135
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,960
-If they are barking yes.

136
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,710
-This little dog which is outside?

137
00:21:54,810 --> 00:22:07,370
-No.

138
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,370
-How is your thirst?

139
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,880
-I’m very thirsty. I drink very much.

140
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:22,130
-For cold or for normal temperature.

141
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:33,880
-He prefers cold drinks.

142
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:40,100
-You remember that you said to us in the beginning if you eat ice cream you will have a

143
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,960
headache, now do you still have this?

144
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,790
-I still have it.

145
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:55,480
-In the same intensity that was before or it’s not so much?

146
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,960
-The same.

147
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,910
-You are not very sure.

148
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:07,910
-I’m sure.

149
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:17,690
-Also you have said if you over sleep, then you get up not well.

150
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:19,880
-Then I’m tired.

151
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:26,460
-How is that? You don’t sleep so much anymore?

152
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:35,960
-No, he wants to sleep more, he doesn’t want to go out, he sleeps very long. He is so

153
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:41,460
tired, he wants to sleep even more.

154
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,210
-He does or he doesn’t?

155
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:54,960
-What he likes to do mostly? To do athletics or to study your lessons?

156
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,720
-Athletics.

157
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,460
-And you play basket ball?

158
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,130
-Football and handball.

159
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:08,130
-What position you play in football?

160
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:14,880
-Defender and attacker.

161
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:20,880
-And you like to be a professional football player?

162
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:42,880
-Maybe, I don’t know.

163
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,630
-Very good.

164
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,880
-His reflexes are extremely good.

165
00:24:49,980 --> 00:25:03,960
-But here you have written that his mind is awkward, what was that?

166
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:14,210
-I think it has more to do with distraction. He can not concentrate when he is walking and

167
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:18,720
perhaps there is something on the way and he doesn’t see it.

168
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,710
-He can fall?

169
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:30,810
-Yes.

170
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:40,120
-Do you have preferences in one of the subjects at school, like mathematics or history or

171
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:59,160
languages or for you it’s the same? What is more easy for you?

172
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,440
-Just the same.

173
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:06,160
-Everything is the same more or less. Mathematics also?

174
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:12,250
-I think mathematics is one of my best.

175
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:30,200
-So that means if he is good in mathematics, he can concentrate. You eat fried eggs?

176
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,940
-Yes sometimes.

177
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,750
-We bake them, not boiled eggs.

178
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:44,050
-But does he have a desire for fried eggs?

179
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:56,310
-No he has very strong desire for bacon, that’s the only time he is eating eggs.

180
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:04,200
-Chicken is really your best food?

181
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,200
-No.

182
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,460
-Not so much now as before.

183
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:20,280
-But the tomatoes still he doesn’t like them. You are sure?

184
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:25,280
-Yes I hate them.

185
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,530
-Was he ever anemic?

186
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:42,030
-No. He had problem with the stomach when he was little, because of diarrhea of milk.

187
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:49,770
Some milk is not good for him but with the Nat mur he liked to drink a lot of milk.

188
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,530
-And then he had diarrhea?

189
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,530
-Yes.

190
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,030
-That means if now he drinks milk, he will have diarrhea.

191
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:08,530
-Yes. After Nat mur he had a lot of pain in the stomach.

192
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:16,040
-Because of gas in the stomach? You were bloated?

193
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:23,300
-No, just pain.

194
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,580
-Do you have eructations?

195
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,830
-Sometimes?

196
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,300
-A lot?

197
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:37,550
-Some of these days was a lot.

198
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:42,800
-Tell me Phos acid how many doses he took?

199
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,330
-For 15 days.

200
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,590
-200?

201
00:28:46,690 --> 00:29:09,500
-No, 30. One month ago.

202
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,470
-If you eat ice cream, where you will have the headache?

203
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:18,000
-In the front.

204
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,210
-Only after ice cream?

205
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:28,970
-With Nat mur he had headaches 2 times and this was not good because first he felt

206
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:39,130
very numbed and paralyzed in the mouth and his right hand.

207
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,630
-During the headache?

208
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:53,630
-No, first he got this and then he slept and then the headache comes and he was afraid

209
00:29:53,730 --> 00:30:00,290
of this, he felt paralyzed in his right side.

210
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:08,550
-You could not move or you could move but it was like heavy?

211
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,300
-Yes.

212
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,630
-This comes 2 times after Nat mur.

213
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:25,040
-What do you like to do when you grow? You want to become a lawyer, an architect, a

214
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:31,790
doctor, what would you like to do or you have not thought about it?

215
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:35,040
-I haven’t.

216
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:56,300
-Difficult matters.

217
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,990
You eat red meat also in your house?

218
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:05,210
-Yes we do. Lamb.

219
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:12,960
-If the meat has fat on it, you like to eat the fat?

220
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:18,460
-Yes.

221
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:38,460
-Always you liked the fat or lately you seem to take the fat even more than the meat?

222
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,710
-He prefers the meat.

223
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:55,460
-He is not sure what he prefers but anyhow if we allow you to eat sweets, as much as you

224
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:09,960
like at this moment, how much you would like to have? Give me an idea.

225
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,170
-It depends of what it is.

226
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:24,130
-Chocolate, sugar, what would you like kataifi?

227
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:31,540
-Chocolate would be approximately 50 grams.

228
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:48,540
-But he likes better other sweets than chocolate.

229
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,790
-Don’t be shy, just tell me I like this.

230
00:32:52,890 --> 00:33:07,450
-Some small pieces of chocolate, gums milky, very sweet.

231
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:14,200
-How much of these you can eat? All day.

232
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:20,700
I want to ask you something else. You prefer to have instead of food, just sweets?

233
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:27,710
-No.

234
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:35,960
-How is your sleep? You sleep right through the night? You don’t wake up inbetween?

235
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:41,380
-No.

236
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:50,130
-In the beginning on the stomach and then on the back or in the side, he turns around.

237
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:58,430
-But he used to sleep on his side mostly on left. Now he turns around.

238
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:03,180
Do you see dreams? Do you remember?

239
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,010
-No.

240
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:16,780
-Does he ever see a nightmare where he will wake up in a fright?

241
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:25,030
-No.

242
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,830
-You don’t remember any of your dreams?

243
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:36,120
-No.

244
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:45,590
-He tries to remember but it has to do with his sugar. He has a fistula in the rectum.

245
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:59,840
-Yes he had 4 times but it’s taken away. It comes back for 4 times but not now.

246
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:07,290
-It was operated 3 times, not by itself went away?

247
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:16,500
-Yes and then with antibiotics the last time.

248
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:23,000
-But do you know that if it comes, you have to leave it ,you can not operate.

249
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:36,930
-I know. And he got one here in his mouth.

250
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,920
-Now lately?

251
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:41,920
-Yes a week ago.

252
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:54,080
-If he perspires, his perspiration smells, is it offensive?

253
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,080
-On the feet yes.

254
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,060
-Quite a lot?

255
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,330
-Yes.

256
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:13,830
-What do you say?

257
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:18,090
-Yes.

258
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:25,410
-Also one thing I forgot when you asked about this psychological state. For quite long

259
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:35,410
periods this year, he has isolated himself from us, he comes from school, he like to be in

260
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:41,920
his room, he watches TV and do his homework and he has a lot of friends that are calling

261
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:54,000
him and he never calls back, he likes to be with them but he takes no initiative to call

262
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,420
them.

263
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,920
-But he studies his lessons.

264
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:10,670
-Yes and he reads some books and see some TV and he is quite social in the family

265
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:20,420
and he is very social when he is together with the boys but he likes his own company.

266
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,590
-He is self sufficient man.

267
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:32,590
-In a way, like his father.

268
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:46,340
-But will you say for yourself that you are hard working, medium working or lazy?

269
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,260
-Between lazy and medium.

270
00:37:51,360 --> 00:38:00,000
-But would you like to be lazy?

271
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,750
-No.

272
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:18,260
-You still like to do some work and you like to be first in your class? You like it? It is

273
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,340
important?

274
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,460
-No, it’s not so important.

275
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:44,180
-It just happens.

276
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:50,820
-Inbetween he can be very angry.

277
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,070
-Then what he does?

278
00:38:54,170 --> 00:39:03,820
-Probably he has reasons for being and mostly it is when he is arguing with his sister

279
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:12,570
and brothers and when he is angry he may throw things and closes in his room and none

280
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:17,630
is able to get in contact with him for hours.

281
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:25,660
-When he throws things he throws against the person or in the floor or he throws it in

282
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,190
such a way that it can not hurt.

283
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:36,900
-It depends how angry he is. When he is very angry, he is throwing at the person, that

284
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,350
happened twice.

285
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:48,110
-When this happened? Can you remember this incident when he threw?

286
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:50,350
-It wasn’t a knife.

287
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:59,100
-I hope. When in time?

288
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:16,270
-In the car.

289
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:27,020
-About? It was one month ago, one year ago, 5 years ago?

290
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:46,020
-It was once I believe in February and October, November last year.

291
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,280
-Today he was very angry.

292
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,270
-And then he shouts or he just throws?

293
00:40:53,370 --> 00:41:06,350
-Yes and then he shuts the door and go into his room, this is the most.

294
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,860
-Are you sure?

295
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:14,100
-I have never seen him throw anything.

296
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,350
-But he is a very caring boy.

297
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:19,100
-For others?

298
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:31,100
-Yes and I think he is very occupied with just this.

299
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,770
-About others also or about injustice towards himself?

300
00:41:36,870 --> 00:42:10,060
-Both.

301
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:20,310
Is in your family the other children quite tall?

302
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,570
-He is the tallest.

303
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,310
-Is he the oldest?

304
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:29,310
-No.

305
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:41,470
-You remember what I told you, wait you will see.

306
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:48,980
-I meant by age, his brother when he was 16, he was 1,30.

307
00:42:49,080 --> 00:43:00,970
-I see what you mean. I wanted the absolute values because it could have been like

308
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:13,220
this. People who are doing Homeopathy, we say the children they grow taller than their

309
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:30,590
brothers or sisters and because of his disease also there is possibility of not full growth.

310
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:43,310
This shows that assimilation is quite good and the situation is…

311
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:56,050
What’s your evaluation? Your evaluation is that he is eating properly for what he has?

312
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:05,550
-No.

313
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:18,590
-So he is not careful with the diet and the idea is that he has been fed up with all the diets

314
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:43,890
and now he sees his values are towards the lower side and he uses more the sweets.

315
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:51,090
-George I don’t think he is very extraordinary in this, virtually all diabetic teenagers rebel

316
00:44:51,190 --> 00:45:14,590
 against the diabetes and their diet is, they eat what they like.

317
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:26,510
-The idea is now, do we have the picture of a remedy at this moment?

318
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:32,930
-There is something I would like to clear up. Last time I wrote down that he was suffering

319
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:38,930
from fissures, now we heard about fistula, could somebody please tell me which was the

320
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:50,090
correct?

321
00:45:50,190 --> 00:46:01,840
-Does he have questions about several things? Why is this? Why is that? Why the sun

322
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:06,430
surrounds the earth?

323
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,430
-No.

324
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:15,680
-He is not an enquiry guy.

325
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:22,920
-It’s fissures.

326
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:34,590
-Because we had written fistula. Fissures were operated? Because it was very painful.

327
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:47,290
-Yes it was very painful.We tried with homeopathy once but we were afraid because he

328
00:46:47,390 --> 00:47:03,870
was so bad, so we went to the doctor to take it away.

329
00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:23,460
-Who wants to speak? Nobody wants to speak.

330
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:42,960
I think that at this moment he is having a picture of a remedy and give me the symptoms

331
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:56,960
that she has used, I just want to check the symptoms.

332
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:13,960
Desire for sweets underlined twice and combined with chocolate, desire for fruits, feet

333
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:24,710
warm in the night, fear of dogs, underlined only once, long sleep aggravates, desires for

334
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:51,460
bacon, aversion tomatoes, diarrhea from milk, perspiration of feet offensive and anger

335
00:48:51,560 --> 00:49:15,460
general, fissure. That’s good enough and the Expert System says what?

336
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:36,460
Sulphur. Put the columns. Sulphur close with Arsenicum, Phos third.

337
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:48,210
Show me Sulphur, explain why?

338
00:49:48,310 --> 00:50:01,120
Feet our of covers, perspiration offensive gives the idea of Sulphur. The fact that he has

339
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:11,880
become warmer also takes us towards the Sulphur. It was very interesting what he said

340
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:27,370
I’m between lazy and medium in putting the effort, which is quite accurate I would say.

341
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:35,880
This is an easy case.

342
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:51,880
So far so good, I think he has been helped quite a lot but still we don’t see the action of

343
00:50:51,980 --> 00:51:07,840
the pancreas, we don’t see the production of insulin to such an extent as to give us more

344
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:21,510
optimism but the way I see him, he is growing and apart of his timidity which is there and

345
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:32,030
is going to be for another 2-3 years I believe, he is growing quite well and in a quite

346
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:49,520
balanced way. I believe with Sulphur we can have a step forward but apply better diet

347
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:58,890
so we can reduce the amount of insulin, it’s very important to give the possibility of the

348
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:13,100
organism to be resurrected, to be functioning again. If you give ready made insulin the

349
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:25,350
organism becomes lazy, I don’t need more. So we have to reduce and keep the sugar

350
00:52:25,450 --> 00:53:03,490
with a better diet, with Sulphur I believe he will manage with 20 units, even less.

351
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:12,400
-My wife should have said that I should be careful and so I will.

352
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:19,360
-This is a very open class, you can be as open as you like.

353
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:27,330
-You said that if he eats a little bit sugar or chocolate he needs more insulin and he is

354
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:34,830
well balanced in the way that he takes blood sugar 4-5 times each day, so he knows

355
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:42,570
where he it is and the average level of blood sugar, as I told you, is approximately 7,5

356
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:57,080
which the doctor in Norway at least is one of the best he ever had. Then my question is…

357
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:08,770
They love it to be underneath 7 of course but mostly when you are at his age is 8 or 9 or

358
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:16,640
even worse of that, my question is how the body is getting lazy because let’s say you eat

359
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:23,680
10 grams of chocolate and drop 2 units of insulin, in what way it is getting lazy?

360
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:34,690
-It’s getting lazy because you keep the sugar low with these 35 units. All together he

361
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:47,690
takes 35 units, what I say is that with the remedy that you give and with the better diet

362
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:57,600
we may be able to come down from 35 and in a few months we may reach, perhaps 20

363
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:06,520
units, which we may have the same results as we have here, keeping the average in 7,5

364
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:10,710
which will be a great improvement.

365
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:24,850
With these cases we don’t have an improvement, we have a degradation. So if by any

366
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:35,860
kind of therapy you are able to reduce the amount of insulin, that means the rest which

367
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:49,850
the body needs, is produced by the body. Clear?

368
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:55,630
-How do you understand his acute disease he had in this case?

369
00:55:55,730 --> 00:56:06,350
-That’s a sign of improvement as well. This is the first time he has an acute and we know

370
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:29,100
that the organism that can have an acute has gone up one step.

371
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:37,600
He never had before high fever. Is it correct?

372
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:43,850
-She told me he had a virus before he even started with diabetes.

373
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:56,100
-This is what we have been saying that in lower group 3 or 4, if you have an acute, the

374
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:05,850
organism does not have enough force to bring out a defense which will bring out fever.

375
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:11,620
This is something that you have to keep it in your mind.

376
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:23,770
-Which children diseases Alexander had?

377
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:44,520
-The idea is that if they can have a better diet with Sulphur, how should we give Sulphur?

378
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:50,520
-Low.

379
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:59,010
-Every day.

380
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:11,270
-How shall we give Sulphur? Daily? Starting from high, from low, from medium?

381
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:44,270
-Low. Who says low? 100. Who says medium 200? Who says high?

382
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:59,770
This time we have to go to 12C, start with 12C three times daily and every week you go

383
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:15,930
one step higher, 13,14,16 etc. And keep this for at least one month but if you see that you

384
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:28,680
observe that the insulin needed is not so much, that means you can use less and less

385
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:42,600
you keep on second month, third month, fifth month.

386
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:52,360
-As to the children’s diseases there was a publication, it might be in a medical journal

387
00:59:52,460 --> 01:00:05,030
about a vaccination against parotitis and you know parotitis can make diabetes and that’s

388
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:12,770
one of the reasons that people say vaccinate against. In Finland everybody has been

389
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:24,770
vaccinated against parotitis and the incidents of juvenile diabetes with certainty went up.

390
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:28,350
It was a good journal and it was 5 years ago.

391
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:30,300
-It was a pediatric journal?

392
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,690
-I don’t remember which one, I’m sorry but anyway

393
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:37,510
what I wanted to suggest is he hasn't had parotitis

394
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:43,710
so probably he has been vaccinated.

395
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:54,150
-About 2-3 years I think.

396
01:00:54,250 --> 01:01:01,080
-When you started noticing the problem? What age?

397
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:13,550
-When he was 9 years old but before this he had a very big problem with urinating in his

398
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:18,040
bed in the night.

399
01:01:18,140 --> 01:01:23,050
-But did he have a problem with much urination?

400
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:41,040
-Yes I think so but he always drunk a lot from when he was very little and the father

401
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:50,050
drinks a lot.

402
01:01:50,150 --> 01:02:03,810
-We don’t know exactly in what age and what caused it but it is one of the possibilities

403
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:13,290
that his organism might have been stimulated towards this direction by some vaccination.

404
01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:30,800
We do not know but it is interesting that he got 3 remedies which are grief remedies

405
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:42,020
which have acted and I see, as far as I’m concerned, he is more open at this moment

406
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:53,500
more expressive and the fact that his father says, he actually expresses his anger, it’s

407
01:02:53,600 --> 01:03:07,820
one more confirmation. Most probably he is more reactive and now it is interesting that

408
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:24,050
after the flu and the fever, for the first time we may have a picture which is really more

409
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:38,540
clear than any other time. So for me it’s very interesting because we know the first

410
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:54,790
analysis we had and now having a picture of a remedy which is I would say 70% clear.

411
01:03:54,890 --> 01:04:11,750
It’s very interesting, let’s see. His doctor who attends is a very good specialist?

412
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:28,960
-Yes, he is considered to be one of the two very best in Norway, he is a Professor.

413
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:50,210
-Very good. What is his opinion so far? The boy is doing well, is doing very well, is doing

414
01:04:50,310 --> 01:05:00,210
medium, what is his last opinion if he said so.

415
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:07,380
-First to say in his opinion is not possible to cure that.

416
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:16,180
-Sure that’s one fact for us also, we are not claiming that we are going to cure but if we

417
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,240
cure what he will do?

418
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:23,840
-He will have a problem.

419
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:30,970
-Because from Norway we had another case where his kidneys were destroyed and two

420
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:39,720
Professors who attended actually said that if anybody cures you, he needs to take a

421
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:55,970
Nobel Prize. So I wonder whether… And one of these two Professors was one who

422
01:05:56,070 --> 01:06:03,170
nominates the candidates but anyhow.

423
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:10,890
This time I will be interested to know. does he know he takes Homeopathy also?

424
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:22,060
-No. To answer your question Alexander has the disease 6 years now. Every year he

425
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:28,310
can’t understand why the increase in the need of insulin it’s not high as it should be, it’s

426
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:31,560
low compared to what is normal.

427
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:43,120
-That’s all he remarks, he doesn’t say that the boy is growing very good, that I’m

428
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:49,590
impressed that his growth is quite good for what he has.

429
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:52,840
-Not the growth but the need for insulin.

430
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:56,590
-Yes I understand.

431
01:06:56,690 --> 01:07:10,840
-He is very satisfied with him and compared with others at his age he has lower average

432
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:19,600
blood sugar levels than others, so he is very satisfied with Alexander and he doesn’t think

433
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:41,340
he is lazy, he thinks he is very good in handling this disease.

434
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:46,090
By his injections, the number of units he is injecting.

435
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:48,510
-He is good, he is low.

436
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:56,500
-Yes, it’s correct from the view, normally it’s a balance between what the body needs and

437
01:07:56,600 --> 01:08:05,010
what the number of units he inject into the body.

438
01:08:05,110 --> 01:08:28,010
-Very good.

439
01:08:28,110 --> 01:08:37,000
Here we have the report of the juvenile diabetes case, the child from Norway, to whom

440
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:49,500
we have ordered to take Sulphur 12, 3 times the day, go up every week. It delayed very

441
01:08:49,600 --> 01:09:01,830
much to start taking the Sulphur, so since 1 month he is taking Sulphur and the report

442
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:12,330
is like this. In general Alexander has more energy and is stronger. He can discuss and

443
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:22,590
disagree with me, he has a very good appetite. In June before he takes Sulphur, he lost

444
01:09:22,690 --> 01:09:36,080
2 of his nails, 1 of big toe and 1 of finger. Just fell off?

445
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:49,580
-The nail on the finger got a little bit inflamed on the root and it’s loosened and (?)

446
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:57,130
it fell off, both on the finger and on the big toe.

447
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:02,290
-In the middle of August he took Sulphur, he was supposed to take it 3 times the day for

448
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:08,550
a week and then go up and so on. After 2 days with Sulphur 12, he got a very strong

449
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:19,040
epistaxis, it started sudden when he was looking on a football match. The next day he

450
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:31,070
also had a hard epistaxis, the third day I saw him a lot of blood coming out. It was really much

451
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:44,900
and in the end the blood was dark, clotted and coagulated. All his life has this problem

452
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:55,150
with nose bleeding but never so strong as these 3 days. One week later I was awakened

453
01:10:55,250 --> 01:11:02,600
in the middle of the night with someone crying. I ran to Alexander room, he was standing

454
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:25,090
on the floor, bent forward, trying to stretch the back of his thigh.

455
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:31,590
He was half awakened, first I thought he had a nightmare, then I understood he had

456
01:11:31,690 --> 01:12:26,480
cramps on the thigh. He is a very tough guy with all his sports but I never have seen

457
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:33,900
him crying since he was a little boy. That is true, I remember because we thought of

458
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,690
Nat mur and all that.

459
01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:43,030
In the age of 3 he had this problem when he slept in the car, he woke up crying with

460
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:51,720
cramps in the thigh.

461
01:12:51,820 --> 01:13:03,950
This episode he had 2 times that week with 13. With Sulphur 15 one morning he had

462
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:13,190
strong pain in the stomach. The pains were so strong that he wanted to sit together with

463
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:22,690
me, he was pale and afraid. He had no constipation, flatulence or diarrhea. After about

464
01:13:22,790 --> 01:13:33,110
3 hours he took some food, after I have managed to persuade him because he had no

465
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:43,310
desire for this. Then he was a little better and wanted more bread, in the end he ate 6

466
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:55,020
slices of bread and then the pains had gone. That is very good diet. Then measure his

467
01:13:55,120 --> 01:14:02,080
level of sugar.

468
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:09,990
As a younger boy he had a lot of pain in the stomach with diarrhea after milk etc. but this

469
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:28,060
pain he may had 4-5 times so strong. After this episode Alexander did not want to take

470
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:40,240
more of the remedy. I called him from Alonissos and asked him if he would try to take the

471
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:46,520
remedy, he was very well and of course he could start to take the remedy again. Now he

472
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:52,740
could not remember that he stopped taking it because of pain. He said he only forgot to

473
01:14:52,840 --> 01:15:01,760
take it. I asked him to try to avoid sweets to see how the remedy acts. This is not so

474
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:10,460
happy with, he said I will try because he still has a very strong desire for sweets. But still

475
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:19,390
with Sulphur the blood sugar has been very stable. He measures the blood sugar by

476
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:30,580
himself 2 times each day. When you say stable you mean low? The blood sugar can be

477
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:36,330
stable and have 4 milligrams.

478
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:43,490
-No, I mean that he used the same amount as he did before and he is not having this

479
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:51,080
jump up and down.

480
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:58,740
-In general he has been more awkward, he drops things easily and as little boy he was

481
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:08,010
stumbling a lot. He is sensitive to noise and if it rains he has problems to sleep because

482
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:17,500
of the noise from it. He needs good sleep, he has isolated himself even more, his friends

483
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:27,800
call him to see him, he says maybe but he never goes out. If I ask him why he would not

484
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:38,050
go out with them, he gets angry at me and do not want to talk about it. It is impossible to

485
01:16:38,150 --> 01:16:54,380
push him, in this he is strong, he does what he wants. Cold, wet weather aggravates.

486
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:59,630
Takes a deep breath.

487
01:16:59,730 --> 01:17:10,460
-I thought he got Ignatia and he was sighing a lot and I thought this maybe was coming

488
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:18,960
up again but now when I heard about Nat sulp I feel it’s more like this, that he takes a

489
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:21,210
deep breath.

490
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:29,720
-This is correct what you are saying. The idea of Nat sulph maybe is a good idea. I would

491
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:43,210
still wait and see the effect of Sulphur and especially if there is an amelioration after stool

492
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:57,960
this is a keynote, then we have to change to Nat sulph in the same manner as he does.

493
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:09,210
But what I would like more to hear in the report would be the actual measurements.

494
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:22,050
You will have to send me some times the actual measurements.

495
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:26,380
-So tell me what was the last remedy we prescribed.

496
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:45,230
-Alexander got Sulphur and he was going to take it from 15 and up, 3 times the day.

497
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:47,960
-For how long? Did he take it?

498
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:58,300
-He took it up to 30.

499
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,710
-And what happened?

500
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:09,470
-He was so well and I felt that this was not maybe the right for him anymore, so I stopped

501
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:24,040
it and in the blood sugar, he has been become very tall almost 1,85.

502
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:31,260
-Oh my god. I was just that all the children that Homeopathy become tall.

503
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:36,710
-Yes and he needs more insulin now.

504
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:42,960
-He needs more? Why?

505
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:55,210
-I think it’s because of his age, he is 17 years old and he is growing so fast and with the

506
01:19:55,310 --> 01:20:08,210
Sulphur he eats a lot, all the day and he has problems of not taking sweets.

507
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:09,460
-He likes sweets?

508
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:25,460
-Yes, he didn’t so much before Sulphur but he is more strong mental and emotional.

509
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:48,710
He seems so ... in good harmony and at school he is studying more efficiently, he does so well and

510
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:57,210
he had problems with epistaxis all his life.

511
01:20:57,310 --> 01:20:58,210
-And now?

512
01:20:58,310 --> 01:21:05,460
-With Sulphur he had epistaxis for 1 week, very much and now for the last year he

513
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:21,120
doesn’t have it anymore.

514
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:33,880
With this fast growing he has pain in his back. When he walks on hard ground, he got

515
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:37,390
pain.

516
01:21:37,490 --> 01:21:41,160
-Pain is mostly on dorsal region?

517
01:21:41,260 --> 01:21:54,140
-Yes and he is (?) and in the morning he often has pain in the neck because he wants

518
01:21:54,240 --> 01:22:09,400
to lie with the head high on the pillow and then he gets pain in the neck. And he also

519
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:28,240
has pain under his right toe.

520
01:22:28,340 --> 01:22:30,480
-He still has aversion to tomatoes.

521
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:49,650
-Yes he has but now he desires fish and ice cream and when we have been on vacation

522
01:22:49,750 --> 01:23:00,350
he only ordered this every day. Fish and ice cream.

523
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:05,070
-He has to take more insulin.

524
01:23:05,170 --> 01:23:19,570
-Yes and he has inflammation under the finger nails but this appeared again now. He had

525
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:32,980
this for 2 weeks ago and  then it was gone and he is not as warm he was, he is more cold

526
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:42,920
especially on his foot and fingers tips and he can be very cold in the finger tips, in the

527
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:55,650
afternoon he is icy cold and have sometimes numbness in these finger tips.

528
01:23:55,750 --> 01:24:05,910
He sleeps on his sides, sometimes on the left, and then on the right. When he goes to

529
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:10,190
sleep he sleeps on the left and then when I come in the morning he sleeps on the right

530
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:25,410
side and he is very refreshed in the morning. I tried to give him Sulphur because I thought

531
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:32,900
maybe I should try once more.

532
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:42,160
-Now is the time for Phosphorus. You have given Phos before, you see now what

533
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:54,290
happened? Now the picture is coming more and more, refreshed sleep and numbness

534
01:24:54,390 --> 01:25:00,200
and coldness, desire for fish and ice cream, is for Phos.

535
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:08,210
-Yes because he is a very strong person and I told him, he is timid, he wants to stay at

536
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:20,700
home, he doesn’t want to go out with his friends but he is more open and he doesn’t like

537
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:26,700
to go on boat. So I asked are you afraid of the sea or what is it?

538
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:34,710
I got sea sick, but today it is so nice weather, Oh, I don't want even then

539
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:44,620
And I remember now when he was very little he didn’t want to go with me into the

540
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:51,870
basement, I was washing and I asked him do you want to go and he said no.

541
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:52,660
-Why?

542
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:59,700
-I don’t know, I think he was afraid with this because when I came up, he was crying, he

543
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:12,950
couldn’t remember I had gone. Still he didn’t want to go with me down there.

544
01:26:13,050 --> 01:26:20,700
-Does he express any anxiety about you, his father, sister?

545
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:38,700
-Yes, he expresses that he doesn’t like contradiction. He doesn’t want us not to disagree.

546
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:55,960
He is very sensitive for everything. It’s difficult to stay aside, he has grown up, he is so

547
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:08,120
sensitive, sympathetic I think.

548
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:13,120
-Still there is desire for bacon?

549
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:34,530
-Yes but not so much for the eggs. But he likes spicy food still and he is not so afraid for

550
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:47,620
the heights anymore. He sits and I’m afraid when he sits, to look at him.

551
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:58,370
He uses his scissors very much to the nails, very much.

552
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:59,870
-Why?

553
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:02,620
-I don’t know. I ask him.

554
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:05,370
-He doesn’t like his nails to grow?

555
01:28:05,470 --> 01:28:12,620
-Or they grow very fast, I don’t know.

556
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:21,620
-He has said that he had pain in the stomach from milk especially. Have you noticed that

557
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:22,610
he still has it?

558
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:26,070
-Not so much.

559
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:40,280
-Also he had said that he desires fruits, still is there?

560
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:57,540
-Yes he likes fruits, especially grapes.

561
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,780
-And fear of dogs, do you know?

562
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:10,730
-Yes he has fear of black dogs if they come suddenly and now we have a hamster

563
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:16,460
because I think he likes all animals and it go away and I couldn’t take it and I said

564
01:29:38,150 --> 01:30:05,470
when there is flour on the bread, he can not hold it.

565
01:30:05,570 --> 01:30:07,730
-If the bread has flour he doesn’t like it?

566
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:13,720
-Yes, it’s so bad.

567
01:30:13,820 --> 01:30:17,220
-Do you know if the perspiration in his feet is still offensive?

568
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:23,470
-No and he is colder.

569
01:30:23,570 --> 01:30:29,480
-Because he used to have hot feet.

570
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:34,980
-He is cold in the afternoon.

571
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:38,970
-So Sulphur did very good.

572
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:57,390
-In this winter he notices I don’t like being (?) anymore, I want to stay in the sun more.

573
01:30:57,490 --> 01:31:12,880
One special thing when he has high blood sugar in the morning, then he has mucus, very

574
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:27,890
thick, thick and white.

575
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:31,390
-How many units he takes now?

576
01:31:31,490 --> 01:31:39,050
-He takes 60.

577
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:46,390
-But as I understand he eats freely ice cream, he eats a lot of food, he eats bread.

578
01:31:46,490 --> 01:31:48,630
-Yes.

579
01:31:48,730 --> 01:31:50,580
-No restriction at all?

580
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:55,050
-Yes I try, no but…

581
01:31:55,150 --> 01:31:56,090
-Yes or no?

582
01:31:56,190 --> 01:32:05,800
-Yes but you use the insulin together with what you eat.

583
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:15,720
-Yes but every day he needs 60 units, sometimes he needs 40 or 50, it’s like this?

584
01:32:15,820 --> 01:32:19,220
Between what? 40 and 60?

585
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,220
-Yes.

586
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:48,720
-So I know better than you how much insulin he needs.

587
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:51,470
-His height now is 1,85?

588
01:32:51,570 --> 01:33:03,220
-Yes 1,83.

589
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:06,980
-His father how high he is?

590
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:16,390
-1,80.

591
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:19,390
-He is now 17?

592
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:27,630
-Yes, in August.

593
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:39,920
-Most probably he will reach 1,88. He is quite big. How is such a big one?

594
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:45,890
-All my children are big.

595
01:33:45,990 --> 01:34:00,340
-OK now what you can do, you can start with Phos 12C once a day and then you

596
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:10,090
monitor the units because I believe now with Phos, after a month of Phos you will be

597
01:34:10,190 --> 01:34:17,590
able to reduce the insulin now.

598
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:27,090
-That will be nice.

599
01:34:27,190 --> 01:34:40,930
-And if you can of course it’s better to make it 13 and every 10 days if you see changes

600
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:49,090
especially if it reduces the desire for ice cream, that will be good and the chocolate and

601
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:56,850
if he reduces or if it changes the coldness and the numbness in the fingers. That will be

602
01:34:56,950 --> 01:35:07,590
guiding symptoms for not wanting anymore Phos and then you give me information and

603
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:11,440
then I will tell you. All right?
