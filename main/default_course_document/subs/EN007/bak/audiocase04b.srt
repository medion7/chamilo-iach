1
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:37,530
Also I want you to comment on his movements, what do they indicate?

2
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:03,860
-He is very much involved with himself.
-Not exactly. What do they indicate?

3
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:16,200
Is it impressive that the movements that the child does, are practically duplicating?

4
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,950
They are specific movements he keeps on doing.

5
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:31,870
Therefore there is a pattern in his movements. Is it a pattern? Can you see it?

6
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,290
There is a pattern. If you video and you keep on the video for five hours,

7
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,860
the same pattern, the same motions, the same movements will be there.

8
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:52,030
What does it mean from a pathology point of view?

9
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,180
-That there is some action.

10
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,450
-There is an inflammation in the cerebellum, there is a kind of process going on

11
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:09,650
in the cerebellum but further than that it indicates that the freedom of the child

12
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:20,050
has been lost and it has been reduced to an automaton. This is an automaton we see.

13
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:33,540
So the more we have the disease on deeper levels, the less we see the freedom

14
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,290
of the person to the extend that a human being can be reduced to an automaton.

15
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,330
It’s like a machine which goes on perpetually.

16
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,930
This is the picture that we have here.

17
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:04,900
I say all these things through the scanning, through the observation to understand finally

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
the depth of the pathology of the child.

19
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:17,830
Then when we see the first sign of improvement, we know that this is a sign of improvement.

20
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:24,020
Now this is a sign of improvement, not that, not the cough, not the convulsions,

21
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,750
not the motions.

22
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,690
All the motions have changed, he doesn’t do it anymore this way, he does it that way.

23
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,440
It means a shift in the symptomatology, it doesn’t mean an improvement.

24
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,510
If you see that, you can’t say the remedy has acted. You just say the remedy

25
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:51,360
has not acted, what is next? What shall we do next?

26
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,430
And only when you see certain signs and we said the signs should be signs of contact,

27
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:07,530
the person comes back to life, to human being. He must have some contact.

28
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,780
-You feel that he has a problem with seeing objects.

29
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,430
-I personally don’t think he has a problem on seeing objects;

30
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:35,210
I think it’s a problem here but it’s not that big problem because he has astigmatism

31
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:43,440
in both eyes. I think he sees objects but he doesn’t relate to them.

32
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,790
He just doesn’t understand and respond to what he sees.

33
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:58,190
The fact that he sees certain things, he sees me crossing the room to bring his food,

34
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,790
so there is stimulation of the eyes.

35
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:14,690
-You have to tell that he might be seeing blur because when he reaches for things, he…

36
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:23,620
-He can not judge the depth.
- No, he was trying this.

37
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:37,520
-Before the whole thing started, six months, there was no problem,

38
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:45,190
he was trying in different circumstances.

39
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,340
-You see before six months, before the whole thing started, he was able to reach things

40
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:59,440
and touch things. You see how the disease has been affected from that point onwards.

41
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,840
-There is no problem. He was trying in different circumstances.

42
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,090
-Before these six months.

43
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,590
-Before six months we didn’t consider that he had a problem because he was responding

44
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,940
to everything that he should do.

45
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,690
That’s what I feel it’s more understanding of these things.

46
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,450
-Does he make sounds?
-Not sounds but …

47
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,150
-He doesn’t articulate.
-No.

48
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:55,140
-What’s the main sound that he makes?
-He does “aaaah” like that.

49
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,200
-Moaning?

50
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:04,380
-No, it is not moaning, he is very passive. He is restless but passive.

51
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,280
-He moves all the time?

52
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:14,210
-Yes and if you hold him he wants to move all the time.

53
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,210
-The general trend is to move, most of the time he has to move.

54
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:39,950
-The tendency is to arch. But when he goes to convulsions first he does that

55
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:45,450
and then he arches, he reaches?
-It’s not so much the arch.

56
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:54,550
-Just the stretch.
-Yes, the extension, turning to the side.

57
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:03,450
I think seeing his eyes, to come out of the shock is strong

58
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,550
and the face is very much contorted.

59
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,530
-It is terrible to look.
-Yes.

60
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:16,610
What he is saying now is very important.

61
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:24,120
What we see, the eye turns to one side, there is a strong strabismus

62
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,210
and the face is very contorted.

63
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:38,710
The remedy has to fit this kind of picture. This is the idea.

64
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:53,440
It was OK for a Down child because they know it is a mongoloid child

65
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,890
and they expect very little. So when they see very little, they are very happy.

66
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:04,790
This is how I perceive the information, not that the child was completely all right.

67
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:17,540
We’ll hear about that. Dentition? I think they will say.

68
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,750
-Very terrible to look. Dreadful.

69
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,160
Horrible to look in the convulsions.

70
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,660
-He gets goose bumps.

71
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,300
-During the crisis?
-Yes.

72
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,900
When this happens, he goes and puts his back…

73
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:19,110
-He has a tendency for hot forehead he is a boy that kicks off his clothes.

74
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:32,800
I went this morning and his body can be freezing to touch but here it can be very calm

75
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,340
but here it’s always hot.

76
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,870
Have you found this description in the Materia Medica?

77
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:09,090
-I found it with epileptic convulsions and worse in hot room better in a cold room…

78
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,870
-Yes, which is the remedy?
-Bufo.

79
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:40,670
-So turn to Bufo. First we spoke about Stramonium. Now there is another idea of Bufo.

80
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:47,830
So for those they do not have the Materia Medica, it says acts on the nervous system

81
00:11:47,930 --> 00:12:00,820
and skin, uterine symptoms marked, lymphangitis of septic origin, symptoms of

82
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:11,770
paralysis agitans, striking rheumatic symptoms, arouses the lowest passions,

83
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:19,020
causes a desire for intoxicating drink and produce impotence, of use in feeble

84
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:29,730
minded children, prematurely senile, epileptic symptoms, convulsive seizures occurred

85
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:36,740
during sleep at night, more or less connected with the sexual sphere seem to come within

86
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:43,480
the range of this remedy, injuries to fingers, pain runs in streaks up in arms,

87
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:51,740
mind anxious about health, sad, restless, propensity to bite, howling, impatient, nervous,

88
00:12:51,840 --> 00:13:15,740
imbecile, desire for salt, feeble minded. What about this remedy? We discussed this remedy.

89
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:23,590
Do you agree with that remedy?
-No.

90
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:34,090
-Why you do not agree?
-Better at night.

91
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:46,120
-He is better at night but he has the convulsions during sleep.

92
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,840
This is one point that may not fit so much.

93
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:03,830
-Impotent sexuality.
-Difficult to judge in this kind.

94
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:13,120
-The actual convulsion…

95
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:25,230
-Here the type of convulsions are not described. Then we have to go and find the type of

96
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:35,730
convulsions that we have in Bufo to see whether we have the convulsions that are horrible

97
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:43,480
to look upon with the distortions and the eyes going with strabismus.

98
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:53,240
Bufo seems a good prescription and if she was in the class giving examination, she

99
00:14:53,340 --> 00:15:01,740
would pass the examination because we can not always make a prescription but we

100
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:10,490
make a logical prescription, the most logical that we can find. So it is a logical prescription

101
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:18,740
though for the one who is more experienced perhaps, this type of convulsions are too

102
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,590
aggressive for Bufo.

103
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:33,320
Bufo is more passive convulsions I would say and less distortion with the tongue

104
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,180
protruding most of the time.

105
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:45,420
If that was a Bufo child he should have stayed in the whole interview with the tongue out.

106
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:51,400
In Bufo there is a kind of thickness around the lips.

107
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,830
The lips actually can be very thick and the tongue is protruded.

108
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:11,980
You see sometimes in the street some people who have very thick lips and they come

109
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:24,740
with this protruding and the impression of the whole thing is here, in that area.

110
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,920
Why that area?

111
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:40,570
Because Bufo says, lowers the sexual instincts, makes a human being concentrated,

112
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:46,420
having all the time his mind upon sexual matters.

113
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:58,870
Now the mouth and the tongue is an expression, it is an organ which is used in sex,

114
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:07,070
kissing etc. So the appearance, that we can see in Bufo, we can not see the genitalia,

115
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:19,140
it is an excessively sensual mouth.

116
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:43,340
And when a human being has been abandoned to sexual pleasure, you may notice that

117
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,640
the tongue protrudes.

118
00:17:48,160 --> 00:18:02,300
Protruding of the tongue is a sign of abandoning yourself into sexual pleasure.

119
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,790
I’m sorry I’m talking about these matters and some ladies here who are really disgusted

120
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:18,040
with the matter but we are talking completely on medical subjects and

121
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,590
therefore you should be able to perceive all these things.

122
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,290
Maybe but it is not, it has nothing to do with that kind of protrusion.

123
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,060
If I was able to give you the impression...

124
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:47,960
You see the eyes become half, the lips are thick, the tongue protrudes,

125
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:52,810
it’s a whole thing that you can see and you say now this is a Bufo case,

126
00:18:54,890 --> 00:19:00,470
with action on this area.

127
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
-It’s not in the Repertory.

128
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:17,220
-Bufo? Yes sure. Sure you relate it, Bufo is one of the main remedies for that.

129
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:33,260
-Cicuta virosa?
-Let’s go to Cicuta virosa now.

130
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:59,870
It says, the action on the nervous system producing spasmodic affections, hiccoughs,

131
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:05,870
trismus, tetanus and convulsions give the pathological picture calling

132
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:11,620
especially for this remedy, whenever this is further characterized by the more

133
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,570
individual symptoms of the drug.

134
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:20,890
Among these are the bending of the head, neck and spine backwards.

135
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:32,640
And the general action of the patient is violent with frightful distortions.

136
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:40,390
That means the one who observes the person he says, it’s frightful to look upon him.

137
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,470
You see the information is here.

138
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:59,220
Violent, strange desires, sensation of internal chill, moaning and howling,

139
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:23,160
does absurd things, marked action on the skin, mind delirium with singing, dancing

140
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:29,620
with funny gestures, everything appears strange and terrible, confounds present

141
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:37,790
with the past, feels like a child, stupid feeling, melancholy with indifference,

142
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:48,740
mistrustful, epilepsy, moaning and whining, vivid dreams, head turns

143
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:57,640
or twisted to one side, eyes;

144
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:09,890
when reading letters disappear, pupils dilated, insensible strabismus underlined,

145
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:20,410
objects recede, approach and seem double, effects of exposure to snow spasmodic,

146
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:26,960
affections of eyes and its appendages, strabismus periodic, spasmodic after a fall

147
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:41,250
or blow, periodic strabismus, stares persistently at objects, convulsions

148
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:46,310
from concussion of brain, thick, yellow scabs etc.

149
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:56,970
Spasms and cramps in muscles and spasmodic going backwards of head, curved limbs,

150
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:07,960
can not be straightened, nor straight once bend, back bend like an arch, jerking,

151
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:16,210
tearing in coccyx, especially during menses, modalities: worse from drafts, concuss,

152
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,010
tobacco, smoke.

153
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:28,510
Suppressed eruption causes brain disease. Elevated eruption at large.

154
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,960
Face distorted horribly but he says also horrible, frightful distortions;

155
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:19,960
that’s enough. So the remedy was Cicuta and it was given Cicuta CM as we said.

156
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:28,310
-Another thing is that it makes blue face, the reaction of the remedy it was said.

157
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:50,470
-…
-Idiotic, imbecility…

158
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,370
Not in this child, it’s not aversion to company, it does not have the possibility,

159
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:10,710
the means the senses are not available. You put this, he does not see it,

160
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,470
he does not judge depth…

161
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,710
What you have to fit is the whole picture.

162
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:23,990
The whole picture as we see it and perceived with the frightful distortions,

163
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,340
that’s why I made it a point in the beginning.

164
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:42,560
Then the head turns to the one side, it’s frightful, it’s difficult to unlock the convulsion.

165
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,810
-It’s typical, it’s not the convulsions that turn to the one side.

166
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:10,130
-Yes but it is not only the bending back, it is the strabismus...

167
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:21,980
What it means “conversion”. You go and stick to conversion and you go wrong.

168
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,780
What is the main action of the remedy upon the nervous system?

169
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:33,310
Paralyzing certain muscles and convulsion to some others.

170
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,560
This is the idea. In what way?

171
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:43,380
In a frightful manner. Where mostly? On the face. What it does? Brings on strabismus.

172
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:50,810
Very prominent, as he discussed it. Very frightful, the whole picture.

173
00:26:50,910 --> 00:27:03,630
Because if you see in the Repertory Cicuta, you may find it is worse with cold air.

174
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:16,210
But you may find it convulsions on cold air, you may find Cicuta as well.

175
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:40,360
We do not prescribe on one symptom, we prescribe on totality and we see really

176
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,710
this remedy fits the totality of this patient.

177
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,150
Convulsions alternating with vomiting.

178
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:04,300
Very good, that’s a keynote that should have triggered those who do not know Materia Medica,

179
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,230
should have triggered them to Cicuta.

180
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,650
There is a difference to Oenanthe. What is the difference?

181
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:24,040
I don’t know, I have not seen so many cases in Oenanthe crocata to be able

182
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:43,150
to discriminate. Let’s go and see.

183
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:10,300
They first gave CM and then 30 because first they got hold of CM and then 30.

184
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:21,310
So they gave both. Anyhow the child had a severe reaction definitely.

185
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,810
He stopped breathing.

186
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,310
-Have you given?

187
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:56,480
-We may have a feedback before we leave this course.

188
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:15,560
-Have you given?
-On Sunday.

189
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,460
-Cicuta, what potency?
-30 and CM.

190
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,310
-Both?
-Yes.

191
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:36,410
-Three days ago?
-Yes.

192
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:40,130
-Do you want to give a feedback?

193
00:30:48,490 --> 00:31:02,630
-He is having fits again but he stopped for three days and then he is having fits again

194
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,480
but they are not so intense.

195
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:29,230
-He continued to vomit, it might be a little bit more than before but not much.

196
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:48,960
-On Friday you will give the whole story. Give few days to see.

197
00:31:53,210 --> 00:32:02,200
You don’t expect anything in three days, what can you find out? There is no change.

198
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,730
This is on six or seven days during the course.

199
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:34,380
-On Sunday and Sunday night he had two consecutive fits at midnight and then

200
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:42,280
for the next two days he was clear of fit and another symptom came back.

201
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,370
He started to retain urine.

202
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,470
-He started to retain urine?

203
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:58,520
-Yes, before it was having six times the day and then it cut it half, so about three times.

204
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,770
This is an earlier symptom.

205
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,530
-How much earlier?

206
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:13,700
-Maybe six or eight months, it’s been off and on.

207
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:32,850
The vomiting increased and he was free for two days and then suddenly the fits came back

208
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:41,350
and they started to become more intense and then yesterday we had a problem

209
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:46,370
with his breathing coming back after he had the fit.

210
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,270
-What did you do to bring back the child?

211
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:58,050
-Just picking him up and smacking him to try to shock him.

212
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:01,100
-How did you hold him? Upside down?

213
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:09,350
-I wasn’t there, she said she was hitting him on the back and just…

214
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:17,530
But he reached a state where he became quite blue because she didn’t know what was happening.

215
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:30,380
Now last night he had one fit and we got out of it quite quickly and  there was no problem.

216
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,350
-Wait a moment. Sunday took the remedy, Monday and Tuesday no fit, Wednesday had

217
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:42,800
the big fit where he turned blue, then it was the day before yesterday.

218
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:48,130
-No, I came on Tuesday.

219
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:53,020
-No, today is Friday. You came yesterday?
-Yes I came yesterday.

220
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,520
-Or the day before that?
-Yesterday.

221
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,850
So they started increasing on Wednesday…

222
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,280
-And when they started increasing, I felt they became very severe, then he turned blue,

223
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:15,350
then I sent you to get some oxygen. Because he was getting small attacks but still

224
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,680
he was getting bluish, you said.

225
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:26,020
-No he didn’t because we didn’t get that far because she was watching…

226
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:32,020
-You stayed the whole night watching the baby?

227
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,370
-We were sleeping very lightly, we got the baby between us.

228
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:47,050
So he has only had one fit last night and I think maybe we didn’t even need to air,

229
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:52,270
I think the breathing had come back all right. That was my feeling.

230
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,230
So that’s the situation.

231
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:33,300
Do we have on this follow up, which is one week later, several days later,

232
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:40,150
have we have information to be able to evaluate whether the remedy is acting or not?

233
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:56,780
-He had an aggravation and the aggravation was in the picture of the remedy.

234
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:06,280
-Yes, anything else?
-An old symptom came back.

235
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:22,190
-So there are some signs, some indications during this follow up we’ve just seen,

236
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:31,020
that maybe we hit the right remedy. The reason we say that is because there is really

237
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,190
a severe aggravation in the convulsions.

238
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:42,680
The fact that he retains urine now is an old symptom we are not really actually sure.

239
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:50,770
The only information we have it’s an aggravation, it is too soon to evaluate such a case.

240
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:56,480
So once you have chosen a remedy and you have given a remedy, you are not going and

241
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,600
prescribe another remedy. When he is blue you prescribe some Arsenicum or

242
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,250
some other remedy to help him and this is wrong.

243
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:14,290
It is better you give something to help him rather than prescribe homeopathic remedy.

244
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:36,560
Let us see the next follow up on 20th of October, that means one and a half month later.

245
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:59,860
- Hold the hands so he can focus on the face and see the eruption.

246
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:33,610
Give me a short report of what took place since Alonissos, that is six weeks ago.

247
00:39:46,610 --> 00:40:03,290
An immediate report you have given already in Alonissos. First he had a big reaction,

248
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:07,530
where he was suffocating…

249
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:16,680
-When we got off the island, I felt he’d be moving, getting progress of the worse all

250
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:23,930
the time and that the reaction that we got on the island was more of the still worsening

251
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:35,430
rather than a big reaction to what it had and by the time we left the island the situation

252
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:43,810
was just continuing with fits but not so many of them.

253
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,930
-By the time you left the island already the attacks were reducing?

254
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:59,780
-They were reducing, they weren’t as many of them, they retained the violence.

255
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,930
-But in the beginning they were very violent after the remedy, he became blue

256
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,950
and could not breathe etc.

257
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:13,950
-This continued. We still have a situation occurring where we got to stimulate

258
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,790
him to breathe.

259
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:27,200
So nothing happened with the 12X Cicuta. Initially we got a good reaction

260
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,450
for 4,5 days and then…

261
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,700
-What was the good reaction according to you?

262
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,710
-He was down to one fit the day and it seemed to be decreasing in intensity.

263
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:43,950
-One fit the day?
-Yes and sometimes none.

264
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:48,330
-The most important was that the intensity very much decreased.

265
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:56,530
-And then after 4-5 days, it came back with a strong intensity again.

266
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:03,120
At that stage we continued with the Cicuta three times the day and we raised it

267
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:08,860
to four times the day and it continued to get worse.

268
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,160
Mainly they were coming on waking which is  in the mornings for about a day

269
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:21,610
we tried to carry out six times the day and then we really saw a strong elevation

270
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:27,860
to irritation and we stopped doing it. Since we stopped it continued the improvement.

271
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:38,030
So continued from here just giving him a dose once the fits became violent, we decreased

272
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:52,860
from three times the day, to two times, to one. The old symptom of regurgitating food

273
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,210
has become very strong.

274
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:58,360
-During that time now?

275
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:06,820
-Yes and he is very happy when it appears food and the exterior is not bothering him.

276
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:14,210
Over the last few days we’ve had the recurrence of some quite violent fits

277
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,320
and yesterday he had five.

278
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:21,810
-It increased the intensity with each one during the day.

279
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:42,790
-The last three days or something. The last time we gave him a dose of Cicuta 12X,

280
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:50,640
straight after he had two violent fits and I thought that maybe was the response to Cicuta.

281
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:56,290
-When was the last time you gave Cicuta?

282
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:07,140
-Four days ago. One dose.

283
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:17,040
-You kept on giving every day? You saw the fit, then you gave one dose,

284
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,060
then the fit became worse.
-Yes.

285
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:24,140
-And then you stopped. You didn’t give anymore.

286
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:32,290
About this rash it came how long ago first time?

287
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:47,290
-It began after the Syphilinum but the Cicuta intensified it but it’s only bright when

288
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:52,470
he is not fitting. If he is fitting, it changes bright and color.

289
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:13,160
-It was on the face, it began under here originally, it moved here and after the Cicuta

290
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:22,960
it came over here and spread down to the shoulder. It continued to stay there until

291
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:31,710
it got worse and what it looks like, it looks like the rash that he had on his genitals

292
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:41,210
has gone into his face and except same reaction that has come upon his face,

293
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:44,090
is what happened on his genitals.

294
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,410
-Are you sure this eruption was similar with the genitals?

295
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:52,490
-I think it’s very similar.

296
00:45:55,810 --> 00:46:03,810
-It’s not constant, this is like pimples. The other one in the genital was constant.

297
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:18,310
-The skin becomes tight, it peels off and you can see he cracks around his mouth.

298
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,060
It wasn’t pimples on the genitals.

299
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,340
-You see you tend to oversimplify things.

300
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:38,580
-And he is also vomiting.

301
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:49,060
-So at this moment the rash is not very bad.
-No.

302
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,160
-A few days ago it was very bad.
-Yes.

303
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:58,810
-But it didn’t bother him?
-No, then he was very happy.

304
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:03,860
-What other observations do you have?

305
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:13,400
-He is more sensitive to Cicuta, he is more responsive of stimulation

306
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,490
and he is on the overall happy.

307
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,730
-But would he respond if you talk to him at all?

308
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:25,170
-No but he watches with his eyes.

309
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:27,480
-What about the restlessness?

310
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:34,470
-This time was with the fit because as I observed him…

311
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:41,560
-Now the restlessness, always when I talk, I talk in comparison with the previous and

312
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:48,550
after the remedy. How is this restlessness now? Just give me this impression first.

313
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:54,340
-It’s just as bad, it can be just as bad.

314
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,630
-It is or it is not?

315
00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:03,140
-When he is not having a lot of fits, he sleeps well, he is not restless.

316
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,420
As the fits come back again, he becomes very restless.

317
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:14,640
-So there was a time of 10 days when he was not restless and now

318
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,890
he is becoming restless again.

319
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:20,320
As restless as before?
-Yes.

320
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:35,660
-…he still has those very restless times. I can’t tell you whether is as often.

321
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,940
-I believe it is.

322
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:48,050
-What about his food? Any other changes that you have spotted?

323
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:57,060
-No, the only changes is his awareness of his surrounding, that’s the only big change.

324
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:02,300
He still regurgitates food and we have days without any regurgitation and other days

325
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:14,300
that he is having lots of fits usually. He also stopped urinating for a while after Cicuta,

326
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:22,220
he was only having two or three urinations the day which is an old symptom.

327
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:36,160
-One thing that did come up after we left Alonissos, we took the boat to cross to Italy

328
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:47,630
and he woke in the middle of the night and he vomited and he looked like he was senseless.

329
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:56,630
It was just a.. but he has done this since 2-3 times in the evening…

330
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:07,230
-No, 2 o’clock in the morning. It’s really late. Vomiting.

331
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:24,390
-Does he suck his fingers?
-No…

332
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,040
-Does he try?

333
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:37,220
-He would after a fit, he comes up and goes “mhhhh” …

334
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:46,480
-Before he goes to sleep?
-It’s a little crying or a little something.

335
00:50:48,730 --> 00:51:01,370
-The fits also are quite different than we talked to you about… and he doesn’t have

336
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:15,640
so much violence in the initial pattern and he throws back and it’s a strong…

337
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:33,220
So this is six weeks later as you heard. What do you think is happening?

338
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:19,090
She says that the reaction is good because of the aggravation and the skin eruption,

339
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:23,440
which has come out and also the fact that he is more alert.

340
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:35,270
-He tries to make contact.

341
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:40,770
-Can we believe the mother?
-Yes.

342
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:06,170
-My question is can we believe the mother? The mother says the child is more aware.

343
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:12,170
This is what we like to hear. She does not know, she said something very important.

344
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,510
This is the most important thing she says,

345
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:19,240
can we believe her?
-Yes.

346
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:28,240
-Then I asked again how much aware? I want to find out exactly.

347
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:35,680
Do you remember that point? How much aware? This is very important.

348
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:44,180
Not yet showed much difference that they will overtly say yes.

349
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:54,580
Therefore still we have some reservations, apart from the fact that we see a struggling

350
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:04,280
within the organism to bring out the disturbance. The disturbance is on different levels.

351
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:07,320
It is on the skin, on the nervous system, on the central nervous system,

352
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:14,080
on the cerebellum and there is a fight of the organism to rearrange all that

353
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,660
and to bring them out,

354
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,580
to bring out more to the periphery the disorder.

355
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,590
When we hear he is more alert, it’s great.

356
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:32,580
But what pleased me most you have not said it. In this interview there was something

357
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,180
that pleased me more.

358
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:44,940
He said he is happy, yes I heard that but I said I do not have objective confirmation.

359
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:54,680
The eyes go… still it is doubtful.

360
00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:02,330
He looks to the camera yes but all this you may say you conjecture.

361
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:05,180
Crying after vomiting…

362
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:13,660
-The restlessness and the automatic movements if he has no convulsion.

363
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:20,510
Also he has pimples on the face…

364
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:30,160
-What you may see is, did you see the restlessness as it was?

365
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,770
He was picking up his foot and eating his foot.

366
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,410
Did you see that in this?
-No.

367
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:41,440
-No, not at all. You may say we didn’t see enough.

368
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:46,990
What is important for me here are two things. When the mother says he is more aware,

369
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:52,740
this I like and the other important thing which I like is when the father said

370
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,740
that the contortions are not so frightful anymore.

371
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:04,240
This is very objective because the parents every time they see the child in such a turmoil,

372
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:08,490
they get the feedback immediately. They are sensitive to the child, they perceive.

373
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:13,740
Now suddenly they see all the contortions are not so much, that means there is a relief

374
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:20,340
on the parents looking upon the child. That means the whole picture has ameliorated.

375
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:25,820
Therefore because of all these points, because of the aggravation, because of the

376
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,580
aggravation of the skin, because of the awareness, then I can believe the mother and

377
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:36,080
because also… testing the mother, I have seen before as I mentioned, that she is

378
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:42,080
a person that you can rely. When she says this, most probably it is this.

379
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:51,930
So here we have a case that is improving and we have to wait and see what happens.

380
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:04,420
-…Where did the start the getting the 12X.

381
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:09,660
-I said the 12X they could give in case the convulsions they become strong.

382
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:20,000
I gave an indication of a kind of relapse in the case.

383
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:26,820
The child is not under my care all the time. He is in New Zealand, in India,

384
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:29,150
in Alonissos in Greece, there is difficult communication.

385
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:35,230
I have to give some indications when the child has convulsions, try 12X.

386
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:36,980
I don’t want to go high, why?

387
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:43,230
Because I suppose that they will give the remedy without real relapse, so I go low

388
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:50,570
and I say OK you can use repeated doses of Cicuta 6X in case he has a relapse?

389
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,320
But how these people can understand what is a relapse?

390
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:58,580
Here it is very difficult for us to assess the situation, never mind for them.

391
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,430
Therefore I give them a kind of indication and say in case of a relapse

392
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:04,150
give a low potency.

393
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:09,150
This is the idea. Under the circumstances it is the best that I thought

394
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,750
that I could do for the child.

395
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:46,340
It is not so important in this case, the pathology is so deep that you may say

396
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:55,340
even 3-4 times the day during the convulsion period. What I was always afraid is

397
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,340
that the child may go into convulsions that are quite strong and he can not breathe

398
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,590
and we have an accident. So I have to give some indications of what to do.

399
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:09,590
But I was afraid to say give a high potency because I needed the high potency

400
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:15,930
in case of real relapse. Then I would use the potency. Oh now we have a real relapse,

401
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:22,920
it’s going back again, eating his foot, making the same movements, the distortions are

402
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:28,780
very bad again. Now it’s the time, now give him 1M or 10M.

403
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:33,340
I will hold this high potency to use it appropriately.

404
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:40,420
In the mean time I’d given a solution to the parents to use little stimulation in case

405
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,780
they feel there is a kind of relapse.

406
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:53,470
I’m explaining to you the logic behind my decisions.

407
00:59:55,730 --> 01:00:02,920
It’s not the ideal thing that I would like to do.

408
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:09,040
What I would like to do ideally, the child is in the hospital and we observe him.

409
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:13,040
OK he has a little bit more convulsions, forget it. Then we continue

410
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,340
without giving any remedy.

411
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:20,930
When there is a relapse and I know what it is a relapse, then I would prescribe

412
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:26,430
a high potency because we started with high potencies, very high potencies actually.

413
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:30,280
Actually here in this case in a case of relapse, we have to go very high.

414
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,180
-CM?

415
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:50,680
-CM was given because they did not have any other remedy and they gave CM.

416
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:54,180
-When you say in a relapse just go high, you mean CM?

417
01:00:54,280 --> 01:01:03,180
-CM yes, in case we know that the remedies have been potentized properly.

418
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:10,280
That’s a big question. A 10M or 200 many times is stronger than 50M.

419
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:19,260
That’s an experience. So when we talk about high potencies, unless we are absolutely sure

420
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:26,010
that the remedy has been potentized 10.000 times, 10.000 in 1, 10.000 in 2 yes then

421
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:31,760
we know what we are doing. But in this situation we have now the potencies are from

422
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:37,760
50 years ago that they are sent all over Europe and they circulate CM.

423
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,140
Now what happens with these remedies nobody knows exactly.

424
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:49,610
I see some people are tired, maybe we have a break and then we continue.

425
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:52,360
-No.

426
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:59,790
-You judge according to your own vitality, there is somebody else there

427
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:05,610
who is just falling asleep. He tries hard to keep his eyes open and he cannot.

428
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:15,640
I have to keep my eyes open until I die! And when I die, you will find out.

429
01:02:43,410 --> 01:03:02,160
- All the emphasis is at that point. where before… it was on the initial part…

430
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:21,310
-These few days that he is worse again, the fits are quite strong?

431
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:22,650
-Yes.

432
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:38,500
-The first three had the full grand mal fit very violent, as violent as…

433
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:54,420
-And he hasn’t have any today.
-He has vomiting today.

434
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:06,900
-This cracking of the corners of his lips?

435
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:12,970
During the whole interview, which lasted quite a while, you will not see the child

436
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:18,320
not  even once bending down and doing these movements that he was doing in the beginning.

437
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:26,470
Which shows that the irritation of the cerebellum has almost subsided by the time

438
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:30,820
and maybe there is a regeneration process now starting.

439
01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:40,140
You remember the cerebellum was shrinked and maybe he will be able to walk

440
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,240
at some point, I don’t know.

441
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:54,000
My observation by that time was that the child did not have at all the automatic

442
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,940
movements that he used to have in the first prescription.

443
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:04,840
And that’s why we see a whole round improvement in the child within these six weeks,

444
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:10,440
which is very impressive for my understanding finally.

445
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:20,430
- …so tight, his mouth like it’s wrinkled…

446
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:30,440
-A face crack.
-A crack in the skin.

447
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:44,450
I will tell you something else, another observation.

448
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:55,170
You see the child so less irritated with his nervous system, if we had seen that

449
01:05:55,270 --> 01:06:01,250
but at the same time the child was aware before and now he is not aware anymore,

450
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:03,350
that’s a bad observation.

451
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:11,250
But they say, the child was aware before and now you see like that and no movements.

452
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:19,750
That’s no good, that’s not a good observation. If the child is better mentally

453
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:28,100
and it’s better in his peripheral nervous system as well, then we say OK, he is doing well.

454
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:34,350
The same observation can be bad one time and good the other time.

455
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:41,040
You don’t say the convulsions are not there, he is better. No, what you want to see also

456
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:47,000
is the mental picture, unless it comes back we have done nothing.

457
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:53,950
It’s not that we stopped movements, no. The child might have been worse now.

458
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:56,200
The child must be aware, that’s the first thing.

459
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,800
What the mother has said is very important.

460
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,350
Continue.

461
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:11,290
-When he sleeps, is he restless in his sleep?

462
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:15,280
-We wake me up two, three times during the night.

463
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:28,250
-He sleeps well, that’s something I’ve noticed but as soon as the fits become strong

464
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:36,000
again, you can see because he becomes restless. Last night he was awake for a long time,

465
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,250
maybe three times in the night.

466
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:17,560
-By the time I saw him he was having 4-5 fits the day. Since he took the remedy,

467
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:26,900
I see quite a lot of 1-2 fits sometimes none, so in general we may say there is an improvement

468
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:33,250
but still it’s not all right.

469
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:42,450
It’s no bad the situation, what we have to do is to continue with this.

470
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:59,650
What we have to do is to give Cicuta perhaps 12C, a little bit higher, just one dose,

471
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:05,850
in case there is a relapse. For instance now, as I understand, there is a peak

472
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:10,100
for two days and it’s coming down because today no fit.

473
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:21,000
Most probably it will go down  but the fits maybe apart one from the other, the periods.

474
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:31,650
So we do in the beginning of the relapse, the first or second day, you just wait

475
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:37,400
for one day or two days and then you give a dose only. And then maybe he does

476
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:44,650
an aggravation and he will come back again and then maybe for a few days no fits.

477
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:48,250
In this way we shall proceed and eventually…

478
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:53,890
This is very difficult to predict what exactly will be the pattern and I just give

479
01:09:53,990 --> 01:10:00,640
some indications, how to use the 12C in case there is a relapse, not to give it immediately

480
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:07,490
but wait until you really see a real relapse. Not immediately with the convulsion 12C, no.

481
01:10:08,490 --> 01:10:13,340
The idea that we have to give constantly medicine is wrong.

482
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:20,190
The more we are able to wait on cases, the more impressive results we are going to see.

483
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:26,220
We don’t have to give repeatedly the doses.

484
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:35,720
I’m talking about a repetition now because of the seriousness of the situation.

485
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:41,870
He may go into spasms and he can’t breathe and the parents will say, George said

486
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:47,150
we must not give him anything and then he dies and then they say, George said

487
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:49,760
not to give him anything and he died.

488
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:58,040
I just interject an information about a case that some of you saw, a cancer case,

489
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:09,470
that you saw cancer metastasis on the bones in Alonissos last year.

490
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:20,070
There was a cancer case, it was given Medorrhinum and she had a severe reaction

491
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:28,620
towards Medorrhinum. There was a fusion, the pleura was full of liquid

492
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:32,620
and it had to be taken away because she could not breathe. She was taken

493
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:45,870
to hospital in Athens and the fluid was taken away several times and the patient seemed

494
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:59,450
to be going down, though the bone pains had stopped. But the collection of fluid

495
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:03,700
in the lung was so great that she could not breathe and she had to be relieved

496
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:05,650
by taking out the fluid.

497
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:15,140
So it was taken to Athens in the hospital and then we were in communication.

498
01:12:16,890 --> 01:12:23,790
Eventually there was a point where the patient started feeling better.

499
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:30,790
She started eating, having more energy, she got up, she walked and every day

500
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:33,220
she was feeling better, no pains.

501
01:12:36,470 --> 01:12:42,870
Even the father, the whole family was there, the father who was very hesitant

502
01:12:42,970 --> 01:12:49,620
in the beginning whether the remedy had done anything, he telephoned and he was

503
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:55,150
in a great mood and he said, she is doing fine, thank you very much.

504
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:01,390
A few days later I received a telephone call and said, she died.

505
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:08,540
What happened? She woke up one night with severe pains on the chest.

506
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:16,620
Three o’clock in the night, so they thought these are the cancer pains

507
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:29,550
which are coming back and did not want to wake me up. And that was a heart attack.

508
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:39,310
And it was a case of Lachesis, the way that they described the pains.

509
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:48,040
It was a case of Lachesis and the patient died by 5 o’clock in the morning,

510
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:56,790
it was an extensive heart attack. The doctor was called and eventually he diagnosed

511
01:13:56,890 --> 01:14:02,890
the heart attack and the autopsy showed an extensive heart emphract.

512
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:08,670
And they said George told us not to give any remedy.

513
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:15,570
I don’t think any remedy would have saved her at the moment but perhaps the correct

514
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:20,790
homeopathic remedy, because it was a case of Lachesis what they described to me,

515
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:31,320
when the pains are coming towards the throat and the patient wants this very open

516
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:38,320
and it extends to the left arm, especially when there is a constriction felt

517
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:43,890
in the throat during the pain, that is a pain of Lachesis.

518
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:51,990
I was very sorry for that case, first of all because she was a very nice girl,

519
01:14:52,090 --> 01:14:57,460
for those who saw her and what I was very sorry of course is that we were not able

520
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:01,640
to show this case as cured.

521
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:08,540
It was the last stage where she had been treated from the hospitals in Germany,

522
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:15,300
she was brought from Germany to Greece, she was a Greek working in the University

523
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:21,540
in Germany and she was treated there several times with all the kinds of treatments,

524
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:30,040
with a metastasis, the last stage of cancer and she died with a heart attack

525
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:32,140
and that’s very unfortunate.

526
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:38,290
You will tell me maybe even if they had phoned you, they would not have time to take

527
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:43,290
the remedy and to have time to act but anyhow these are the facts, I’m giving you

528
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:46,270
the feedback and I’m saying that you must be careful.

529
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:57,030
Somebody else from the States he had a patient and the patient took a remedy

530
01:15:57,130 --> 01:16:03,280
and after the remedy he developed a lump in the throat and said, George said not to give

531
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:10,520
a  remedy. The lump was cancer and he was taking from my practice because he did not

532
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:18,370
diagnosed cancer and he said George said it’s OK if this is reaction, this is OK.

533
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:26,050
No, George does not say these things. George says, you better be careful because

534
01:16:26,150 --> 01:16:33,100
I can not imagine all the different possibilities that may exist in your practice

535
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:38,030
and you have to be careful and aware of what you are doing.

536
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:44,520
I can only show you here under a specific case what is the observation,

537
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:46,160
 what is the evaluation.

538
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:57,640
Next follow up.

539
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:02,970
-It doesn’t work the 12 and we may go to 30.

540
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:17,970
We have now a follow up that was taken in England, not by me, by somebody else.

541
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:27,710
The case was taken in the end of September, what you saw is in the end of October,

542
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:32,890
six months later, now you will see a follow up on February.

543
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:17,800
-This is the situation George since we saw you in October 87 and your instructions

544
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:22,380
were to give 12C Cicuta.

545
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:34,810
So when we got here we gave one dose of Cicuta and the convulsions may be stopped

546
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,410
for ad few days.

547
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:44,780
After nine days they came back again and I repeated the 12 a couple of times

548
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:46,380
with no results.

549
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:59,450
At that point I waited for a while and in the 26th of November instead of giving

550
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:08,700
the dose of 12C that acted well, I gave one dose of 30 and there was no change

551
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,800
for about a week after that.

552
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:22,580
On December the convulsions stayed still and they didn’t come back again.

553
01:19:25,270 --> 01:19:36,960
They begin to come back in the middle of February. At this time when he got

554
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:48,470
the 30 of Cicuta, he begun to get a lot of coughs and colds and then virtually

555
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:51,320
went continuously through winter.

556
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:07,470
There was a terrific discharge and cough in the chest but this discharge was smelly

557
01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:18,720
and creamy yellow to green, it was very perfused. On the 24th of December

558
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:33,970
he got the mumps and swelling for two weeks, I think. From the time

559
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:39,820
the convulsions stopped, his progress was quite dramatic and quite quickly.

560
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:52,720
He really stopped pushing his finger into his left eye and this is something..

561
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:56,070
as the convulsions…

562
01:20:56,820 --> 01:21:04,470
So he pushes his finger very hard in the lower left arm and he exerts a terrific amount

563
01:21:04,570 --> 01:21:09,310
of pressure because you can see his finger gets…

564
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:21,400
He stopped vomiting at that time and the rash on his face disappeared almost completely.

565
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:29,230
The genital rash remained, just coming and going.

566
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:39,380
All the period that the convulsions stayed, the strabismus wasn’t so noticeable,

567
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:55,970
it diminished quite a lot and he got an improvement in vision and he was able to reach

568
01:21:56,070 --> 01:22:04,070
and take things and not only to reach things but he was able to grasp straight away.

569
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:18,050
Over that period he begun to crawl and he continued this and he even made a few steps

570
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:29,430
walking. And also he has begun to think outside of physical stimulation.

571
01:22:29,930 --> 01:22:35,830
In other words he’s begun to respond to us, if I clap my hands he laughs

572
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:41,430
and at times you will get respond to a smile and get excited.

573
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:55,550
By the 15th of February, the convulsions returned to a point where I felt

574
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:57,610
I should repeat this Cicuta.

575
01:22:58,630 --> 01:23:07,010
At this point he was doubling over and going into a fetal position

576
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:17,030
but there was no rigidity in the convulsion at all. So I repeated 30 in that February.

577
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:30,530
End of June it was taken.

578
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:42,480
Did you hear the symptom I was talking about?

579
01:23:43,490 --> 01:23:45,980
Pressing the eye during the convulsion?

580
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:55,440
It’s interesting what I wanted to mention but most probably this movement

581
01:23:55,540 --> 01:24:02,030
is a kind of automatic relief on the situation, it’s like acupressure.

582
01:24:04,050 --> 01:24:06,280
He was doing his own acupressure.

583
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:11,690
It’s a kind of relief that most probably he was having and automatically

584
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:24,790
he was pressing there. What I would say, can you tell me?

585
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:49,180
You have the story and there is an improvement with no question about it.

586
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:55,430
The cerebellum is regenerated definitely, he even said he took a few steps perhaps

587
01:24:55,530 --> 01:25:06,680
if I hold him, which is impressive and now he says, the convulsions are coming back

588
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:12,260
and now he thought that is the time to repeat the remedy.

589
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:14,950
This is the point I want to discuss with you.
