1
00:00:20,557 --> 00:00:25,920
This case is a boy, how old is he?<br/>– 10 years old.

2
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,958
– I saw him 2 years ago. 3 years.

3
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:42,006
First consultation, was given Hyoscyamus 200C and 1M

4
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:59,125
and last years was given Causticum 200C, 4 doses, once a week. How is he?

5
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:02,541
Give me an overall impression of how the boy is doing.

6
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:10,045
– He has been fantastic, emotionally better to express himself, mentally improved.

7
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:17,470
So he has been really great in school this year. This year he has improved the most.

8
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:29,709
He is now on the level of his peers in Math, this year he got up with the curriculum

9
00:01:30,686 --> 00:01:35,942
and he is now on the level so he is doing fantastic with the other kids

10
00:01:37,037 --> 00:01:43,141
and then another thing; in the beginning of the year he began a second language,

11
00:01:43,462 --> 00:01:48,518
French and I wanted to pull him out, because it was too much for him,

12
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:53,398
but they told me that all the kids will be learning a little bit of this a little bit of that.

13
00:01:53,918 --> 00:02:01,198
Apparently, in a matter of 2 or 3 weeks... They asked us if we speak French at home

14
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:06,630
and we said no we don’t. He is doing fantastic in French

15
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:12,117
and got even awarded for his excellent achievement in French.

16
00:02:15,085 --> 00:02:24,254
He got the award and he is fantastic in Math, he is able to work more

17
00:02:25,093 --> 00:02:28,846
and we know that because we work together with him at home.

18
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,342
So he is able to concentrate more, he is willing to do the work.

19
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:39,846
Before he was always oppositional, probably because of the struggle he has to do...

20
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:47,910
Cognitively he is able to understand more obviously, he is responding more,

21
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:57,782
he asks question, so communication is more initiated in a conversation.

22
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:02,653
With strangers not so much, he hides behind us a little bit.

23
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:21,806
Asthma didn’t improve much, with Hyoscyamus it was fantastic,

24
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:29,029
now asthma throughout maybe 30% of what it was with Hyoscyamus,

25
00:03:29,645 --> 00:03:32,997
there is always asthma lingering there in the background.

26
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:38,309
And it was going a little bit to the max right now in this weather with the humidity,

27
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:43,815
even in Greece. Before he never had problems in Greece. Now he has also.

28
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:50,296
So asthma remained there. – So the main problem is asthma now.

29
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:54,767
– Asthma and autism definitely.

30
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:10,728
– New symptoms that may have appeared during the last year? Fear of animals is less.

31
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:16,160
– Yes, he handles it a little bit better, so it’s less.

32
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:25,895
– He has nose bleeds from right nostril in the morning.

33
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,737
– Actually it’s alternating sometimes it’s the right, sometimes it’s the left.

34
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:35,840
This is a new thing.<br/>– Last year it was mostly right

35
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:42,767
but in March is actually started more on the left. That is maybe once per month.

36
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:49,472
It’s not very often.<br/>– Teeth yellowing.

37
00:04:52,511 --> 00:05:04,400
– He got the cleaning done of the yellow deposits so it was yellow which is unusual for a child.

38
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:07,463
– Bad breath occasionally?<br/>– Yes.

39
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:16,104
Can I just add with the bad breath that also something fairly new after the report,

40
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:27,600
sometimes he has at the corner of his mouth a white. I guess it’s connected with that.

41
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:34,024
– He understands everything.<br/>– Yes.

42
00:05:36,912 --> 00:05:52,455
– He is feeling a little bit shy. Very good boy.<br/>– In the evening he turns on all the lights.

43
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:58,383
– Yes he goes from room to room and turns on everything.

44
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:04,471
– He likes the light even in the night?<br/>– No, he sleeps in the dark

45
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:11,576
because he still sleeps with us in our bed. So it’s dark.

46
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:13,584
We don’t need light when he sleeps.

47
00:06:14,472 --> 00:06:19,880
– He sleeps with you?<br/>– Yes.Still.Could be because of the asthma.

48
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:25,752
Because his asthma crisis is happening in the evening

49
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:30,935
and then escalates during the evening so during the night he could have a problem.

50
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,440
– Do you have another child<br/> – No.

51
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,096
But when his cousin comes from Toronto he sleeps with her. He is 3 years older.

52
00:06:41,784 --> 00:06:45,808
They are very close together. So his sleeps in another room with her.

53
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:49,072
– He needs some company in the night.<br/>– Yes.

54
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:52,871
He slept maybe 4 or 5 months alone and then he had bad asthma attacks

55
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:55,864
during the night and after that he sleeps with us.

56
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,695
– Did he complained during these months? Did he get out of his bed?

57
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:13,224
– No, he was sleeping. We believe it’s just fear of asthma attack.

58
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:21,584
– Because he can stay in the room in a house and I go around...

59
00:07:22,464 --> 00:07:38,361
- He doesn’t have fear to be alone. But to sleep alone yes. He does not like.

60
00:07:39,488 --> 00:07:44,560
– But he slept for 5 months.<br/>– Yes and then he had really bad asthma attacks

61
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:51,303
during the night. He woke up and started crying...<br/>- What time was he waking up?

62
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:56,664
– It was not this year, it was the last year, sometime in May.

63
00:07:57,664 --> 00:08:09,200
– No he asks what time in the morning.<br/>– Around 5 a.m. in the dawn.

64
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:22,305
– Not 4 to 5 a.m.?<br/>– It could be. I can actually check if have written down.

65
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:33,904
– Did he have an attack at other hours or only that hour in the morning?

66
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:52,320
– Mostly, 95%, it escalates during the night. <br/>- Now it’s mostly in the evening.

67
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:57,449
Between 10p.m. and 12 a.m. is the worst period. We give him a puffer

68
00:08:57,713 --> 00:09:03,593
and after that he calms down.<br/>– Do you give him anything during the asthma attack?

69
00:09:03,873 --> 00:09:12,009
– We have to. Ventalin. That’s the only one that doesn’t have steroids.

70
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:19,898
– Did you try to avoid giving Ventalin to see how he does?

71
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:24,658
– Of course! We give him only because sometimes,

72
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:30,281
when we say bad we mean his stomach rises so diaphragm works,

73
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,898
the lungs don’t have oxygen so we need to give him at that time.

74
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:45,305
So we tried to postpone and then...<br/>- Now as soon as he starts with the crisis,

75
00:09:45,906 --> 00:09:51,186
you give him immediately or you wait half an hour? – We wait.

76
00:09:51,497 --> 00:09:55,666
– For how long?<br/>– We wait until the stomach really pushes inside

77
00:09:56,226 --> 00:10:01,730
and that’s the sign that there is not enough oxygen as far as we know, so we give him.

78
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:06,297
And he is ok to wait. He knows the level, he waits himself.

79
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:28,290
– This asthma was in childhood?<br/>– No. It appeared 2011 in July.

80
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:35,329
One year before we came here first time

81
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:43,410
and our homeopath Helen tried to do something and we couldn’t so

82
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:48,762
that’s why 2012 we came here to see you and you prescribed Hyoscyamus

83
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,929
and it worked amazing with asthma too.

84
00:10:52,378 --> 00:11:00,986
This time Causticum worked magically in the mental level and emotionally,

85
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:06,593
he is able to express himself.<br/>– Ok, let me ask you something else.

86
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:18,842
How much of his asthma is back again from the original state?

87
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:22,834
If you compare how he originally was with his asthma and his asthma now,

88
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:32,409
would you say it is 50% of what it was? 30% or 80%?

89
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:45,746
– You mean before Hyoscyamus? At the very beginning, 30% of the very beginning.

90
00:11:46,202 --> 00:11:51,506
– Now it is 30% of the original state.<br/>– Yes.

91
00:11:58,202 --> 00:12:03,178
– Have you seen him touching his genitalia lately?

92
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:06,066
– That was before with Hyoscyamus very much.

93
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:14,202
Now, maybe I saw him 3 times in a year, so that’s why we didn’t put it in the report.

94
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:36,266
Plus he is 10 years old.<br/>– How is his thirst? Normal?

95
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:44,362
– I would say a little bit below normal, at home he wasn’t drinking much

96
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:52,970
but here, probably because of the bottles, this is a new thing,

97
00:12:53,450 --> 00:13:00,089
he drinks from the bottle in Greece. We are here in Greece from June 7th, 10 days.

98
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,050
So before that I would say it was below normal

99
00:13:03,762 --> 00:13:07,666
but he drinks a lot because of our diet, he drinks broth soup,

100
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:13,353
I make it every day. So with every meal he drinks a cup of soup.

101
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:21,409
- He likes soup.<br/>- He loves it but it’s also a part of our diet so it’s sort of necessary.

102
00:13:31,097 --> 00:13:34,625
- You like soup?<br/>– Hmm yeah.

103
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:44,146
– Good expression.<br/>– Yes, this is another thing.

104
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:46,945
He closes his eyes when he has to answer

105
00:13:47,386 --> 00:13:51,746
or he closes our eyes when he has to answer something that somebody is asking.

106
00:13:54,833 --> 00:14:23,410
– What can I do? That’s life. Very good. If you want to describe his emotional state,

107
00:14:24,002 --> 00:14:36,298
what would you say?<br/>– I think he is very open now to express with us,

108
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:46,923
the biggest difference we saw in Hyoscyamus and now is when he is sad, he is crying.

109
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:53,659
He is expressing. Before he would just cry if I said no, scolding him or something

110
00:14:54,435 --> 00:15:05,291
but if somebody close is not very nice to him, he would suppress

111
00:15:06,251 --> 00:15:13,339
and then you would see the regression. He would not show. Now he is different.

112
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:22,282
– That means you will see a kind of sadness coming after somebody has insulted him?

113
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:28,971
– No. Now we see, before we didn’t see anything.

114
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,587
It was just nothing and then you would see maybe peeing in the bedroom at night,

115
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:41,875
you would see that he is more serious, not laughing,not very playful.

116
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:53,307
But now he comes and I ask him if something has happened particularly in school,

117
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:57,907
in March I asked him if something happened with his best friend

118
00:15:58,251 --> 00:16:03,635
and has was very sad for 2, 3 weeks but he was crying

119
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,067
and then I would ask him what happened

120
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:09,922
and he wouldn’t like to talk about it much but he was crying.

121
00:16:10,515 --> 00:16:16,266
He was showing his emotions and then I would just say it’s ok to be sad,

122
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:24,827
it’s fine until he stops crying and we move on. He was crying for 2,3 weeks.

123
00:16:25,315 --> 00:16:31,723
That was a very traumatic moment.<br/>– What happened? Did you learn?

124
00:16:32,172 --> 00:16:35,451
– Yes, I sort of found out. Somebody told him

125
00:16:36,011 --> 00:16:45,227
that he and his best friend are like little babies who eat snow. Both of them.

126
00:16:45,947 --> 00:16:50,107
– He likes to eat snow. And there is a lot of snow in Canada.

127
00:16:55,203 --> 00:17:01,219
– So somebody told him they are like babies. He didn’t mind that

128
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:06,147
but the other kid is very small in size and he is very sensitive to that,

129
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,955
so I guess after the comment he wasn’t playing with him anymore

130
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,130
and joined the bigger group and he is the best friend,

131
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:16,658
they were together from grade one.

132
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:21,451
Obviously he did not understand that like I wouldn’t understand that,

133
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:30,570
so his reaction was normal. After that peeing in the bed during the night started,

134
00:17:31,219 --> 00:17:37,028
he started having little accidents during the day, not much, just a little bit

135
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:48,339
and that lasted for a month and we gave him Causticum at the end of April

136
00:17:49,787 --> 00:17:59,067
and in May for four weeks once per week and then the peeing disappeared

137
00:17:59,587 --> 00:18:10,130
and around June 10th everything was ok. The last 10 days were just normal.

138
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:15,911
So one month after basically all these during the night and during the day things,

139
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,919
even though he was expressing, but there is also that part there.

140
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:29,311
And before, with Hyoscyamus he would have accident peeing the bed

141
00:18:31,206 --> 00:18:36,542
but he would also regress a little bit mentally,

142
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:39,719
like you would see the difference in his speech.

143
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:43,542
That’s how the deep suppression was at that time.

144
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,247
– Except accidents, everything else was normal.

145
00:18:56,358 --> 00:19:03,534
– When you say he closes the parents eyes when asked to answer a question,

146
00:19:05,975 --> 00:19:10,023
what does he do? He puts his hand?<br/>– Yes.

147
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:14,871
Because when I ask him for example to tell me something in French he wouldn’t

148
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:21,350
and then I try to help him at the very beginning, I was trying again and again

149
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:27,318
because I am bad in languages, he would tell me mama only in English please.

150
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:32,551
You are a hopeless case for French.And then later when they told us how great he is

151
00:19:32,927 --> 00:19:35,007
I asked him to tell me something in French

152
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:37,943
and he would not demonstrate his knowledge.

153
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:46,127
Then finally he agreed to say something, he closed our eyes so that we...

154
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:55,943
- He closes your eyes in order to give you the answer?<br/>– Yes. Sometimes he closes his.

155
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:02,991
For example if you would ask him if he can close your eyes, he closes his...

156
00:20:09,262 --> 00:20:14,910
- The hours of aggravation of asthma, when I gave him Hyoscyamus,

157
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:19,743
were the same as now?<br/>– No.

158
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:31,207
– The hours at that time?<br/>– At that time it was more from 1 a.m..

159
00:20:31,455 --> 00:20:33,198
So he would fall asleep for a little bit

160
00:20:33,678 --> 00:20:39,446
and then around 1 a.m. to 4 a.m. it would escalate more and more.

161
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:47,494
Now it starts in the evening, 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. and then slowly until maybe midnight,

162
00:20:51,334 --> 00:21:00,215
and then throughout the night he is ok. We give him the puffer, Ventalin,

163
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,967
and he sleeps through the night but before with Hyoscyamus, even with the Ventalin

164
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:09,207
he wakes up and aggravates until 4 a.m. maybe...

165
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:23,255
- For how long is he taking Ventalin? These last months.

166
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:31,126
– He is being on and off very frequently. Maybe 2 or 3 days he doesn’t have it

167
00:21:31,494 --> 00:21:34,046
and then the 4th day he needs it.

168
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,447
– Everyday?<br/>– No.

169
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:41,639
But when it’s humid like this he needs it every day. Maybe even more than once.

170
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:52,847
A few days ago there was rain then in the evening it was sunny

171
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:55,502
and the morning it was sunny and that’s the worst.

172
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:03,023
– He had a dental treatment also?

173
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,582
– I know. I didn’t want to do the dental treatmentbut ...

174
00:22:07,014 --> 00:22:14,430
- Ok, did they give him injections for anesthesia? – Yes.

175
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:23,462
– When was this?<br/>– February this year. But we went to the holistic doctor.

176
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:30,990
So they don’t use the fluoride at least.

177
00:22:32,023 --> 00:22:40,142
– The asthma started or became worse after the dental treatment? – No.

178
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:45,502
it happed before when that silly doctor gave him fluoride and I didn’t even see,

179
00:22:46,223 --> 00:22:52,015
that was before Hyoscyamus, at that time his asthma was very bad.

180
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:56,647
But this time there was no change in the asthma, I didn’t notice

181
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:05,110
and we went to that other doctor.<br/>– When did the return of the asthma come?

182
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,878
Not here I am talking about this time.

183
00:23:12,263 --> 00:23:16,087
There was a period after Hyoscyamus that there was no asthma.

184
00:23:23,631 --> 00:23:28,048
– 3 months after Hyoscyamus he was almost without asthma

185
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:34,390
and then September 2012 it started reappearing and after that it never completely left.

186
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:40,551
– So after Hyoscyamus the asthma was better only for 3 months.

187
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:57,935
– Yes. And then slowly it came.<br/>– What does he like to eat?

188
00:23:59,207 --> 00:24:04,191
– Well again because of our diet we don’t know if it really reflects

189
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:14,103
but he loves to eat watermelon.<br/>– What else do you like to eat?

190
00:24:14,726 --> 00:24:20,430
– Peach. He loves peaches.<br/>– Fruits?

191
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:30,038
– Yes. He likes meat.<br/>– You have limited him?

192
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:35,670
What is your profession? Are you a teacher?<br/>– Yes, I am a teacher.

193
00:24:41,886 --> 00:24:49,703
We are trying to do something about teaching. I am teaching interior design.

194
00:24:50,342 --> 00:24:58,327
So nothing medical although I am interested in.<br/>– But you are teaching grown-ups.

195
00:24:59,454 --> 00:25:05,679
– College kids. Older than 20 years.

196
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:22,615
– Does he like fruits in general?<br/>– Yes but not many fruits, he is very picky.

197
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:26,832
He doesn’t like berries, strawberries. He loves cucumber

198
00:25:29,783 --> 00:25:36,183
and not much fresh vegetables.<br/>– Cucumber is the best for him?

199
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:42,543
– Yes.<br/>– Salt? How much salt he eats?

200
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,574
– He likes, not very salty but he likes.

201
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:48,137
– He likes to add some salt?<br/>– Yes.

202
00:25:48,782 --> 00:26:00,142
– Does he like taking salt and putting it in his mouth?<br/>– No. He likes meat. Chicken.

203
00:26:04,527 --> 00:26:09,959
– With fat in it?<br/>– Yes.He loves fat and now the new thing,

204
00:26:15,214 --> 00:26:18,494
because I make this broth and I am taking the bone marrow,

205
00:26:19,822 --> 00:26:29,487
he loves everything around the bone, he peels off the bone. Every meat around.

206
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:34,247
That’s a new thing, before he didn’t like the bones, now he likes ribs

207
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:45,071
and everything with a bone. He loves duck and lamb. This is the newest one.

208
00:26:48,343 --> 00:26:56,351
– Does he like sweets?<br/>– He never liked at all.

209
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:01,999
– That’s the reason why he likes watermelon that has sweeter taste.

210
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:17,679
– The water he drinks must be cold from the refrigerator or not?<br/>– No.

211
00:27:18,056 --> 00:27:21,303
We usually give him regular so he doesn’t ask for cold water.

212
00:27:22,423 --> 00:27:25,406
– Ice creams?<br/>– Not now.

213
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:32,223
He used to be allergic to milk so I was making the juice and freezing it,

214
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:40,335
now we are getting there with our diet.<br/>– But he doesn’t mind cold.

215
00:27:40,871 --> 00:27:46,511
– He likes the cold things but he doesn’t ask for them.

216
00:27:50,695 --> 00:27:56,903
– He eats the snow.<br/>– That’s right yes. Quite a bit.

217
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,967
– Is he good in Math?<br/>– Yes. Like his father.

218
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:20,909
– His mother is also good. She is just shy.

219
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:27,246
– Is the father also a teacher?<br/>– No. I am a mechanical engineer

220
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:33,094
and I am working as an IT, in computers.

221
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:41,301
– Not in the CIA? You said information, I am joking.

222
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:29,374
Did he ever have an otitis in the past?

223
00:29:30,173 --> 00:29:42,669
– He had an ear infection when the whole thing started, when he was 2 years old.

224
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:58,158
But after the Causticum, after the second week, we were in Greece, Chalkidiki,

225
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:03,318
he was there and during the night the right ear was aching

226
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:12,094
and then I put a hot compress and it went away in the morning.

227
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,029
We were hoping to get worse...

228
00:30:15,902 --> 00:30:24,918
- But in the past, he had any severe otitis?<br/>– No. Only that when he was 2 years old.

229
00:30:25,294 --> 00:30:37,646
– When he was 2 years old he had a severe otitis, in which the ear was discharging?

230
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:43,894
– No, there was no discharge. He was just given antibiotics 2 times and that’s it.

231
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:51,622
- Two series.<br/>– Why are you saying “too serious”?

232
00:30:52,206 --> 00:30:59,486
– Well, not too serious. It was November and then February, he had one otitis,

233
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:06,182
one antibiotic and then February they gave him again antibiotics

234
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:23,030
and another course of antibiotics back to back. Two series he said. So 2 times for 5 days in a row.

235
00:31:23,358 --> 00:31:25,437
Once and then again.

236
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:39,078
– The autistic problems started after the otitis?<br/>– Yes.

237
00:31:42,045 --> 00:31:44,733
– About 6 months later you noticed?<br/>– Yes.

238
00:31:56,054 --> 00:32:04,647
– You don’t know the type of antibiotics that were given?<br/>– Amoxicillin.

239
00:32:07,766 --> 00:32:25,502
– And you had given him vaccinations as a baby?<br/>– A few. Not everything.

240
00:32:25,998 --> 00:32:28,846
We were postponing. We didn’t want to vaccinate him

241
00:32:29,302 --> 00:32:33,574
but in Canada you need a paper. I didn’t know because I am from Serbia.

242
00:32:34,246 --> 00:32:39,638
So until I found out how to get the paper and go to the lawyer to understand

243
00:32:40,062 --> 00:32:42,830
he had to go because he had lots of eczema

244
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:47,254
and we were taking him to the doctor very often at that time

245
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:54,918
and the doctor was pushing and maybe I was too weak as a mother.

246
00:32:56,694 --> 00:33:00,337
– Last one he received was when he was 18 months

247
00:33:00,662 --> 00:33:07,430
but in Canada that’s already 10 vaccines in total.<br/>– No he didn’t get 10 vaccines,

248
00:33:07,797 --> 00:33:15,197
he get maybe 4, 5. I can give you the list, I don’t want to know.

249
00:33:15,557 --> 00:33:20,565
I want to forget that but...<br/>- You have to repeat unfortunately

250
00:33:20,878 --> 00:33:22,790
because I did not understand.

251
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:36,141
– He received 4 or 5 groups of vaccinations in Canada at once, that’s how they give it.

252
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:42,926
He received at birth, he received at 6 months, at 9 months, at 12 months,

253
00:33:43,453 --> 00:33:47,470
already delayed and then he received at 18 months and then we stopped.

254
00:33:48,598 --> 00:33:53,110
Then we got the paper and he didn’t receive anything after that.

255
00:33:55,061 --> 00:33:58,349
– But even these vaccines they were postponed.

256
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:01,892
– Actually the vaccines that were supposed to be received at 18 months

257
00:34:02,221 --> 00:34:05,061
were received at 2 years. So we delayed them as much as we could.

258
00:34:06,332 --> 00:34:15,964
– But after all these vaccines he had the otitis crisis.<br/>– Yes.

259
00:34:16,493 --> 00:34:19,629
– And then he had the antibiotics.<br/>– Yes.

260
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:29,261
– And then again antibiotics for how many days? 10 days?<br/>– Yes.

261
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:38,773
– And about several months later you noticed the problems.<br/>– Yes.

262
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:45,716
– The original eczema, where was it?<br/>– Everywhere.

263
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:55,517
– Everywhere or mostly on the bends?<br/>– Everywhere and not a little bit.

264
00:34:56,117 --> 00:35:00,084
It was like 3rd degree burns. Oozing.

265
00:35:03,093 --> 00:35:10,213
- If you remember, the oozing if you touched it, was it sticky?<br/>- Yes.

266
00:35:11,013 --> 00:35:17,949
– Like honey?<br/>– Yes, like maple honey.

267
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:30,021
– So it was a matter of one doze of one remedy to save the child by that time.

268
00:35:30,397 --> 00:35:32,461
- I understand now.

269
00:35:39,629 --> 00:35:43,133
– Does he like music?<br/>– Yes. He likes music and he likes to dance.

270
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:55,549
– Is he happy when he hears music or sometimes he becomes a little bit sad?

271
00:35:56,029 --> 00:36:06,685
– Always happy and moving. Well, sometimes he likes to play with the sticks now,

272
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:17,484
like a wand, like wizards from the movies and sometimes he has choreography,

273
00:36:18,085 --> 00:36:28,964
he does something with his stick, he shuffles and it’s like he is dancing.

274
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:41,028
He has one more thing which is maybe important.

275
00:36:41,381 --> 00:36:47,093
During the night in Canada for the year he is tossing a lot

276
00:36:47,492 --> 00:36:51,668
and turning and tossing his covers off. It wasn’t before with Hyoscyamus.

277
00:36:52,301 --> 00:36:55,316
– Restlessness in bed?<br/>– Very restless during the night.

278
00:36:56,525 --> 00:37:03,308
And then tosses off his cover and then he is sneezing, he is cold.

279
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:13,989
But still tossing covers. Also, a new thing, there is mucus and hard stuff,

280
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:19,061
so he cannot breathe during the night, so we have to put the pillows up

281
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:24,325
because of all this mucus...<br/>- He is sleeping like this.

282
00:37:26,109 --> 00:37:32,877
– Sometimes bends his knees up. That’s very different from before.

283
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:45,245
And he is sneezing in his sleep as well. Also in his sleep, he makes a sound,

284
00:37:45,773 --> 00:37:50,246
not grinding teeth, sometimes he is grinding his teeth, but like slurping,

285
00:37:50,868 --> 00:38:02,772
I can’t even make it. Like sucking your saliva in and also likes his arms uncovered

286
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:09,445
even if it’s cold, very cold he keeps his arms uncovered.

287
00:38:15,941 --> 00:38:21,222
It’s interesting, the restlessness in sleep now we came to Greece, it improved.

288
00:38:22,126 --> 00:38:26,053
He is actually sleeping very nicely in Greece.

289
00:38:29,988 --> 00:38:36,772
And another thing, before he didn’t want to start swimming, he always loves water,

290
00:38:37,205 --> 00:38:44,069
but he was scared.<br/>- He loves the water, what did you say?

291
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:52,101
– The previous years, he loved the water but was never relaxed enough to swim,

292
00:38:52,613 --> 00:39:00,597
he always kept in shallow. This year he just went swimming without any training,

293
00:39:00,933 --> 00:39:12,213
that was it. Yes. He was ready to start swimming last year but he was holding himself.

294
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:18,405
This year, no problem.<br/>– So maybe letting go anxiety, fears...

295
00:39:28,677 --> 00:39:33,868
He knows when he is ready. Very certain.

296
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:39,037
For example I asked him to learn to ride a bike, he doesn’t want to ride a bike.

297
00:39:40,604 --> 00:39:47,748
One day after 2 years, he sits and he rides.

298
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:51,437
So he really knows when he is ready to do something.

299
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:56,429
Very certain , not many people are.

300
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:08,973
– Does he like fish?<br/>– Not really. Mama made fish last night and he didn’t want to eat it.

301
00:40:10,093 --> 00:40:21,316
– He eats it occasionally but he doesn’t like it.<br/>– Maybe a big thing.

302
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:35,125
He was allergic to fish and then we gave him last year, after 3 months of diet,

303
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:42,308
a little bit and we tried again and he was ok. So he ate it a few times

304
00:40:43,045 --> 00:40:45,956
and then after that he did not like it.

305
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:50,901
– The problem is that you have to know

306
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:59,022
in the process of treatment the original eczema may come back.

307
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,029
You now that?<br/>– Yes.

308
00:41:01,453 --> 00:41:05,942
– And that would be a good sign. Also the otitis.

309
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:11,404
– That’s why when it happened a little but last year, I was hoping.

310
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:25,013
– have you read my books?<br/>– Yes, I have read some. Can I ask you one question?

311
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:33,053
When you tell Ms. Mitsakis for a remedy,

312
00:41:34,005 --> 00:41:39,749
can you please also tell us when he has extreme asthma what to do then?

313
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:43,093
Should we repeat the remedy or not?<br/>– No.

314
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:46,629
Don’t repeat the remedy during the asthma attack.

315
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:57,629
Try to avoid if you see the asthma crisis is not very strong, he may suffer a little bit more,

316
00:41:58,165 --> 00:42:09,653
but he may overcome it. But if you see him suffering a lot, you have to help him.

317
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:20,694
But eventually we have to cure the asthma and then the eczema which will be worse.

318
00:42:23,245 --> 00:42:30,076
– So not repeating the remedy when there is a crisis. Ok, that’s all. Thank you so much.

319
00:42:41,389 --> 00:42:49,925
Some of the analysis you hear and some of my thoughts you could follow

320
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:58,533
when I was taking the case. Now it’s very clear what has happened to the child.

321
00:43:00,237 --> 00:43:15,798
The child was born absolutely normal. But the vaccinations originally

322
00:43:17,405 --> 00:43:28,357
and then the antibiotics brought about the state of autism as they diagnosed it

323
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:41,277
but this is the case as I have said before, that the child was not born autistic,

324
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:53,852
was made autistic by vaccinations and drugs. Such cases are much easier to treat

325
00:43:54,765 --> 00:44:01,428
and to help than the originally autistic children.

326
00:44:02,093 --> 00:44:07,957
Children who were born autistic very little advance.

327
00:44:12,796 --> 00:44:18,949
In his case they avoided the repetition of vaccinations

328
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:26,573
and that is why the damage done was not so severe

329
00:44:27,317 --> 00:44:33,796
as to be able to have this kind of improvement that they relate.

330
00:44:35,253 --> 00:44:40,061
If they had given full repetitions of all the vaccinations

331
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:44,325
then we would have to battle much more

332
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:49,437
before we can bring the child to that state in which he is now.

333
00:44:54,117 --> 00:45:06,109
Always remember that when you give a remedy and the remedy has acted, wait.

334
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:16,317
Do not jump and give another remedy because what you will have...

335
00:45:18,085 --> 00:45:25,941
In the beginning you give the remedy which is not needed. You notice nothing.

336
00:45:26,509 --> 00:45:28,988
Then you give another one and you notice a little change

337
00:45:29,765 --> 00:45:33,597
and then you give another one and there is a little bit more change

338
00:45:34,653 --> 00:45:42,022
and eventually you find out that you have managed to bring back the whole situation

339
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:50,668
by giving wrong remedies but now the original remedy will not do the work.

340
00:45:52,933 --> 00:45:59,117
So it’s very important to understand when to say

341
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:08,405
wait, let the organism fix the rest, the little things that are there”

342
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:33,213
In this boy it is interesting that he has this habit of closing his eyes or the eyes of others

343
00:46:33,812 --> 00:46:41,477
which can be translated as timidity, shyness.

344
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:50,237
And which is the remedy that has shyness? Baryta carbonica.

345
00:46:50,989 --> 00:46:53,997
How many of you thought of Baryta carbonica?

346
00:47:03,941 --> 00:47:10,581
I will tell you something in continuation to what I said yesterday

347
00:47:12,005 --> 00:47:19,405
concerning what we treat and what is the personality of the person.

348
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,644
We don’t treat the personality, we treat the pathology upon the personality.

349
00:47:34,053 --> 00:47:43,685
Concerning this the boy was doing, did you notice anything which impressed you?

350
00:47:51,445 --> 00:48:01,493
In the interview we had, I was talking and said ok the boy is doing like that etc.

351
00:48:02,693 --> 00:48:13,437
Did you notice something which impressed you? I will tell you what impressed me.

352
00:48:16,588 --> 00:48:21,124
When I said something, I can’t remember now what to the mother,

353
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:32,285
when I said something the mother was holding a paper. Did you see that?

354
00:48:32,908 --> 00:48:37,148
She took the paper and went like that. Did you notice?

355
00:48:38,045 --> 00:48:47,621
– No.<br/>– Nobody noticed? Who noticed that the woman felt timid, shy and...?

356
00:48:51,301 --> 00:49:06,604
You did? Oh, yes I said you are a teacher. What is the boy doing is this.

357
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:20,012
So that means there is some genetic predisposition that passes

358
00:49:20,645 --> 00:49:29,757
from our parents to the children. This genetic predisposition is something

359
00:49:31,693 --> 00:49:41,149
that forms the characteristics of our character, our personality.

360
00:49:44,597 --> 00:49:56,477
For instance, taking myself as an example, since I remember,

361
00:49:57,029 --> 00:50:01,245
since I was a very small boy I always wanted to understand

362
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:07,917
why this person reacted this way, I had to analyze, to understand

363
00:50:08,645 --> 00:50:15,173
and inside me I would find the reason why he said that, why he did that etc.

364
00:50:15,653 --> 00:50:27,740
It’s my character. If you say now this character is being very critical

365
00:50:29,141 --> 00:50:39,301
because in our repertory we have rubric which says “censorious, critical”

366
00:50:41,981 --> 00:50:55,660
If my tendency to analyze and to understand becomes annoying to others,

367
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:59,789
that means I always analyze them and I tell them,

368
00:51:00,773 --> 00:51:10,140
then this natural tendency characteristic of my personality becomes pathology.

369
00:51:11,941 --> 00:51:27,468
That I have to tell, to annoy others. If I don’t do that, this characteristic is normal,

370
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:38,789
if I overdo it and I annoy others by my critical mind,

371
00:51:40,085 --> 00:51:45,788
then the remedy Arsenicum, Sulphur or Veratrum album

372
00:51:46,196 --> 00:51:51,141
and all the remedies that are very critical will reduce that

373
00:51:51,669 --> 00:51:57,709
but will bring me back to the normal characteristic of my personality.

374
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:09,373
I am talking to you about the last day with the child. I said this child now is normal.

375
00:52:09,892 --> 00:52:14,973
He says 70% is better swearing. Yes, sure.

376
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:22,885
That is normal for him because he has the tendency in his character to tease,

377
00:52:24,029 --> 00:52:35,660
has the tendency to draw attention to himself.

378
00:52:38,253 --> 00:52:53,981
If this is overdone by throwing tantrums, making a lot of fuss then you give the remedy

379
00:52:54,533 --> 00:53:00,421
because this is too much. Then this tendency will be reduced

380
00:53:01,597 --> 00:53:07,006
and will come to normal, to what is normal in his character.

381
00:53:07,844 --> 00:53:19,221
So if you want to understand for yourself what is my normal character,

382
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:31,796
you have to go back to a period when you feel good in general.

383
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:39,980
Maybe that was 10 years ago, or 20, it doesn’t matter. Maybe it was yesterday.

384
00:53:40,613 --> 00:53:45,797
When you feel good. How you behave when you feel good?

385
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:56,669
My wife says one more word and I say ok, forget it.

386
00:53:59,229 --> 00:54:09,549
This is my normal character because I tolerate. But now this characteristic changes

387
00:54:10,637 --> 00:54:22,181
and my wife says something that aggravates me and i am flying, i am responding, i am answering.

388
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:29,605
That is the pathology that has started.

389
00:54:32,717 --> 00:54:44,029
The natural characteristics, if they are exaggerated and are manifesting in such a way

390
00:54:45,013 --> 00:55:03,117
as to disturb others, then can be treated but you cannot treat a personality as such.

391
00:55:04,948 --> 00:55:14,628
Personality is the total amount of thinking, feeling etc.

392
00:55:16,556 --> 00:55:21,645
that a person has in his normal state.

393
00:55:23,181 --> 00:55:33,149
Once he is not aggravated by somebody trying to irritate you,

394
00:55:33,629 --> 00:55:37,765
is not aggravated by pollution atmosphere,

395
00:55:38,228 --> 00:55:42,292
is aggravated by an injection you have given...

396
00:55:43,156 --> 00:55:52,309
You go to the doctor, you go to the dentist and he gives you 2 injections of anesthesia

397
00:55:53,428 --> 00:55:57,796
and you go home and after that you feel lousy

398
00:55:58,268 --> 00:56:01,740
and you are not anymore your normal self.

399
00:56:02,724 --> 00:56:10,284
A weak constitution will remain in that state after the dental treatment

400
00:56:13,588 --> 00:56:17,772
and a strong constitution will get it out.

401
00:56:19,348 --> 00:56:29,540
This boy was not able to throw out the effect of the total vaccinations

402
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:41,181
and antibiotics and where he was affected? Right in his mind.

403
00:56:45,245 --> 00:56:47,605
It is so important to understand these things.

404
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:54,308
Because he had an eczema originally,

405
00:56:56,724 --> 00:57:04,908
the eczema was suppressed and it went into the lungs.

406
00:57:07,061 --> 00:57:16,684
Eventually the interference with different drugs and vaccinations

407
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:38,156
suppressed the asthma and affected the brain. You see how the disease is manifesting.

408
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:46,748
This is the way. That boy shows you exactly the way diseases manifesting

409
00:57:48,188 --> 00:57:57,324
and how dangerous it is to interfere on an organism with chemical drugs

410
00:57:58,636 --> 00:58:01,828
and all these kinds of vaccinations,

411
00:58:04,364 --> 00:58:08,700
because vaccinations are targeting the immune system,

412
00:58:10,388 --> 00:58:12,812
to change your immune system.

413
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:25,229
Your immune system is not able to counteract an epidemic

414
00:58:26,644 --> 00:58:37,420
and you interfere by saying you will be able to counteract in epidemic and take this. And the immune system changes

415
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:43,469
but in changing the immune system it changes the whole structure of the human being

416
00:58:45,908 --> 00:58:51,380
and whatever changes you brought about in the immune system

417
00:58:51,741 --> 00:58:56,269
in order to prevent an epidemic from taking place,

418
00:58:57,028 --> 00:59:03,812
all these changes are diffused in the rest of the human organism

419
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:11,798
and then you have results of that type.

420
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:21,109
You know how many children have attention deficit disorder?

421
00:59:25,716 --> 00:59:33,037
Millions today. Attention deficit disorder.

422
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:53,244
Next are children with Asperger syndrome, much heavier but not yet too much.

423
00:59:53,925 --> 01:00:04,213
Then you have the autistic children and then you have the born autistic children.

424
01:00:05,229 --> 01:00:12,820
You will see all these, put it together and see how many millions there are today

425
01:00:13,413 --> 01:00:20,821
of all these categories and you will see what we have produced in the human race

426
01:00:22,045 --> 01:00:27,909
by wrong interference. Nobody will do a research

427
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:33,533
and if he does a research of that type, will never be published.

428
01:00:38,837 --> 01:00:47,340
They find 1.000 reasons why this has happened to the human race,

429
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:55,364
especially of the Western Europe and America. They will never find out,

430
01:00:55,933 --> 01:01:02,285
they will never say that this is because of the medicine and the vaccination.

431
01:01:02,685 --> 01:01:05,669
They will find pollution in the atmosphere, competitive society...

432
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:17,636
They create confusion so people do not know the truth, they cannot find the truth,

433
01:01:17,964 --> 01:01:20,788
they cannot come to the core of the matter.

434
01:01:34,621 --> 01:01:46,685
I think if I had enough voice I would show you a case with a nice man.

435
01:01:52,077 --> 01:01:59,853
I was battling with him, I knew he had got gonorrhea but he refused it.

436
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:07,205
I tried this way, I tried that way, the other way,

437
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:15,869
no it was not gonorrhea, no I don’t remember, no...

438
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:28,028
I wanted to give Medorrhinum but I wanted the confirmation.

439
01:02:29,309 --> 01:02:41,725
His symptoms were not clear. I said ok, take a dose of 30C, just to check out.

440
01:02:46,205 --> 01:02:52,045
He comes after some time and says I had such a bad aggravation,

441
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:55,684
he wrote me a very bad email, I had such a bad aggravation,

442
01:02:56,053 --> 01:02:58,661
you gave me this and spoiled my health...

443
01:03:01,796 --> 01:03:11,308
That showed most probably that you had gonorrhea, that’s why you have the reaction.

444
01:03:12,828 --> 01:03:28,572
Then he writes a very impolite email to me and says forget it.

445
01:03:30,228 --> 01:03:38,444
Yesterday or the day before yesterday, after 2 years of Medorrhinum 30C

446
01:03:39,501 --> 01:03:46,132
I wanted to show you the case, he wrote and he said I must apologize.

447
01:03:46,924 --> 01:04:05,284
I feel better all over. 2 years, one dose of Medorrhinum 30C and he made me crazy,

448
01:04:06,164 --> 01:04:17,028
I knew he had gonorrhea because of some other things and he would not accept.

449
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,325
So one dose and now what he writes.

450
01:04:22,148 --> 01:04:24,965
Most probably the symptoms are coming back after 2 years,

451
01:04:26,189 --> 01:04:37,940
so he writes to me I am thinking of using now Medorrhinum 1M.

452
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:48,868
I pretend that I didn’t read exactly the email,

453
01:04:49,492 --> 01:04:52,156
I read only the mail where he says

454
01:04:52,701 --> 01:04:58,164
I have been only for 2 years in a very good condition etc.

455
01:04:58,533 --> 01:05:02,445
and I said thank you for your good words and stopped.

456
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:09,212
Today in the morning I received another email,

457
01:05:10,444 --> 01:05:20,028
he says if in the beginning I had told you that I had gonorrhea,

458
01:05:20,469 --> 01:05:39,741
what potency would you have given me? You see how the human mind works.

459
01:05:41,045 --> 01:05:51,438
He puts the question but he does not say, shall I take a dose of 1M now?

460
01:05:52,196 --> 01:06:05,628
No, he says if I had accepted... Now I made him feel a little bit bad because his son,

461
01:06:06,644 --> 01:06:14,589
who was an autistic child with very bad behavior

462
01:06:15,661 --> 01:06:28,917
- his mother came and by biting her she was blue all over...

463
01:06:43,013 --> 01:06:52,021
the child was so because of his problems also and he thought he could get out

464
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:57,004
and not say what has really happened.

465
01:06:57,948 --> 01:07:10,741
If people do not give you the information, you are lost but also you have to search

466
01:07:16,556 --> 01:07:42,156
Going back now to the case. How many symptoms you have used? 21 symptoms.

467
01:07:48,500 --> 01:08:06,812
Show me. Fear of being alone in the night, timidity, epistaxis, sneezing during sleep,

468
01:08:07,285 --> 01:08:14,492
offensive odor, discolored, asthmatic respiration difficult at night,

469
01:08:15,614 --> 01:08:27,645
respiration wheezing, restless sleep, skin eruptions suppressed, chicken desire...

470
01:08:28,485 --> 01:08:37,636
I asked put chicken desire instead of duck, he says duck! I looked at him

471
01:08:38,653 --> 01:08:47,165
and he really felt if I had a piece of duck now I would eat it! This was the idea.

472
01:08:48,061 --> 01:09:00,421
He was so expressive. So I said put desire for chicken. He said also chicken.

473
01:09:08,397 --> 01:09:43,622
So what is the remedy? Look a very strange phenomenon.

474
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,532
The remedy that comes first...

475
01:09:49,965 --> 01:09:59,365
I have found this myself. I think it was not originally in Kent.

476
01:10:04,101 --> 01:10:28,565
But anyhow, show. Graphites. He has used 21 symptoms and Graphites has only 11.

477
01:10:33,484 --> 01:10:38,268
But Graphites covers some very interesting symptoms.

478
01:10:38,773 --> 01:10:41,837
Aversion to sweets is all along strong.

479
01:10:42,429 --> 01:10:48,301
We gave Causticum because of aversion to sweets

480
01:10:48,772 --> 01:10:54,668
and yet this symptom was not taken away by it.

481
01:10:55,493 --> 01:11:01,820
Because this symptom also belonged to an underlying remedy

482
01:11:02,517 --> 01:11:06,156
which again had aversion to sweets.

483
01:11:06,684 --> 01:11:11,804
That’s why aversion to sweets continues staying there.

484
01:11:14,301 --> 01:11:23,581
So aversion to sweets and suppressed eruptions and restless sleep...

485
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:32,844
Graphites has restlessness in sleep quite strongly on third degree

486
01:11:33,381 --> 01:11:45,334
which the boy really has started the moment he entered the idea of Graphites

487
01:11:46,556 --> 01:11:54,646
he has restlessness in sleep. Strong restlessness in sleep as she described.

488
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:03,997
Perspiration in the night, fish aversion also,

489
01:12:07,229 --> 01:12:16,554
is known that Graphites does not like fish, sweets and salt.

490
01:12:17,599 --> 01:12:29,301
If you have these 3 symptoms you can cure a boy with whatever he may have.

491
01:12:30,044 --> 01:12:45,012
It’s very simple because what we do...

492
01:12:45,676 --> 01:12:58,309
In this case of the boy the brain is retarded and we take some signals of the organism

493
01:12:59,116 --> 01:13:05,437
and through these signals we stimulate the organization in his brain.

494
01:13:09,563 --> 01:13:18,851
We stimulate it through a remedy which we discover through little symptoms

495
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:28,668
like aversion to sweets which is so important.

496
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:42,212
Because the sugar level how much an important part of digestion and combustion is.

497
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:48,332
This is very important part. And the organism says don’t give me sweet

498
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:51,620
because you will poison me.

499
01:13:56,756 --> 01:14:07,123
You give me sweet by force, they forced the child to take fish, ok I take it

500
01:14:08,299 --> 01:14:16,571
but I don’t like it because it is like poison for the organism of that child.

501
01:14:33,579 --> 01:14:42,771
I draw your attention to these things because you are medical doctors

502
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:47,979
having been trained to think of pathology. What is the pathology?

503
01:14:48,955 --> 01:14:57,299
It’s bronchitis, what is indicated for bronchitis? These antibiotics, take them, finish.

504
01:14:58,443 --> 01:15:02,627
And here it doesn’t matter whether it is bronchitis, pneumonia,

505
01:15:03,148 --> 01:15:15,724
cystitis or psychotic episode. Aversion sweets becomes important in all these cases.

506
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:30,116
The organism knows quite well what needs in order to function

507
01:15:32,044 --> 01:15:35,597
so you have to pay attention to this.

508
01:15:38,444 --> 01:15:44,491
In Nitric acid they take the fat from the others

509
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:49,244
and they eat it because they cannot digest it.

510
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:58,348
If you see the stool of Nitric acid is full of fat that’s why it is floating.

511
01:16:00,691 --> 01:16:05,508
Because the fat is not absorbed. So the organism says give me fat!

512
01:16:06,171 --> 01:16:08,539
In Natrum muriaticum; give me salt!

513
01:16:09,188 --> 01:16:13,307
I can’t take enough salt from the food, give me salt!

514
01:16:14,852 --> 01:16:18,404
Some people make their food white

515
01:16:19,171 --> 01:16:22,203
and other people say for God sake how can you eat this food.

516
01:16:22,835 --> 01:16:47,427
And yet their organism cannot absorb. In this boy there is another desire for cucumber.

517
01:16:49,948 --> 01:16:56,965
Show me desire for cucumber. You will see Graphites is not there.

518
01:17:01,349 --> 01:17:05,476
Antimonium crudum, Phosphorus, Sulphur, Veratrum album.

519
01:17:10,804 --> 01:17:18,980
My question was, as you may have understood from my questions,

520
01:17:20,027 --> 01:17:32,116
was it a case of Phosphorus after Causticum? This is not a good idea.

521
01:17:34,628 --> 01:17:39,724
Because Causticum and Phosphorus are supposed to be inimical.

522
01:17:40,348 --> 01:17:49,011
So if Phosphorus or Causticum had acted do not give its inimical

523
01:17:49,507 --> 01:18:01,019
because it will upset the system. But Phosphorus was having the desire for cucumber.

524
01:18:03,044 --> 01:18:17,788
So there are 2 possibilities here; either after Graphites the desire for cucumber

525
01:18:18,788 --> 01:18:25,331
will be gone in which case Graphites has that symptom,

526
01:18:26,315 --> 01:18:36,579
desire cucumber but is not recorded yet, or the desire for cucumber will remain

527
01:18:37,084 --> 01:18:51,677
as the next remedy will be Veratrum album or Phosphorus. Possibly Veratrum album.

528
01:18:53,852 --> 01:19:02,644
This is how we conceive the progress and what is going to happen in this boy.

529
01:19:05,587 --> 01:19:20,603
I had another autistic child that went they brought it to me in the first place I said,

530
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:31,836
most probably Homeopathy will be able to help this boy so he can go to the university,

531
01:19:35,267 --> 01:19:42,962
it did not go to the university school he is in a technical school now learning decoration

532
01:19:45,268 --> 01:19:54,811
but the difference between this brain to an organized brain...

533
01:19:56,803 --> 01:20:01,427
he plays chess much better than me, I am not a good chess player

534
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:07,995
but he will beat me very fast, he beats the computer,

535
01:20:09,508 --> 01:20:15,564
playing computer chess is very difficult to beat it even the first level.

536
01:20:16,084 --> 01:20:23,436
He beats the computer even in level 10. Like the child.

537
01:20:24,699 --> 01:20:26,715
Like the child likes Mathematics.

538
01:20:27,452 --> 01:20:37,868
The brain comes organized more and more and you observe this

539
01:20:38,971 --> 01:20:47,563
and you feel really that Homeopathy is worth being established

540
01:20:48,308 --> 01:20:57,919
as a complimentary health medicine. Just don’t forget this. Thank you.
