1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:31,150
I would like to ask you if anybody can tell me what it means when it says in the Repertory

2
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:39,980
hypochondriacal anxiety?

3
00:00:40,080 --> 00:01:02,310
-There is a couple of references in the Repertory where it says I think hypochondriacal

4
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:10,460
anxiety is a kind of morose worry.

5
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,660
-Can anybody has an idea what is hypochondriacal anxiety, in practice what we see?

6
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:30,240
-A person who has a headache to say I'm having a heart attack...

7
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:43,740
-It's more the concern about the patient's health...

8
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:54,240
-It's over concern ...

9
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:03,820
-Everything you said it's correct and described it but I have here the manuscript of a

10
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:16,070
patient who gave it to the doctor, this is what I have and described beautifully what do we

11
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,080
mean by hypochondriacal anxiety.

12
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:29,660
I'm going to read you that paper which the patient gave and you are going to decide which

13
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:37,990
is the remedy. You look hypochondriacal anxiety, which are the remedies and then I leave

14
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:45,980
you that paper and then you tell me which is the remedy.

15
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:57,150
He starts saying in writing I have a tumor in my genitalia. He keeps on writing, later on

16
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:04,520
it proved to be a hernia.

17
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,740
He had an idea that this is a tumor, it was diagnosed as a hernia but still doesn't believe it.

18
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:27,740
He says I have a tumor. Where? Still the doctor may tell him "yes, this is a tumor".

19
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,070
He says I went to the doctor to some neurologist and he gave me Valium, Valium is a

20
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:41,580
tranquilizer. I went to another neurologist and he gave me Tryptizol 10 mg,

21
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,660
[drug name] and [drug name] for one and a half year. These are all neurological medicines.

22
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:56,910
Then I stopped these medicines gradually by myself and by the advice of the doctor.

23
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:10,180
I was very thin and I put on some weight. Advice of the doctor 72 kilos.

24
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:20,160
He means the advice of the doctor was that he should be 72 kilos. Now I'm 72.

25
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:28,110
I stopped taking the pills and from time to time I was taking [drug name] until now.

26
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:37,180
I do not have a sexual relationship with a woman and I said to myself that if I had a woman

27
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:45,270
I would stop taking the drugs. It happened that I had a relationship with a woman who was

28
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:53,530
married and I cut down the pills.

29
00:04:53,630 --> 00:05:02,150
Stupid if I take them again. From 76 to 79 I was not taking any medicine.

30
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,660
During that period I met a woman who became my fiancé. No thought about marrying

31
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:29,140
her. Eventually start to have problems, difficulties. What are the difficulties?

32
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:41,390
I could not discover her character because she would speak very little and this...

33
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:53,660
I tried to let her go many times, underlined this and then I felt I regretted it and I could not

34
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,660
stay away because I felt sympathy for her and I came back to her because she looked

35
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:10,910
attracting to me.

36
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:17,660
Thoughts about marriage. Should I marry her or should I not?

37
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:26,910
Because of her character, because of her lack of a house, she didn't have a house,

38
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:32,660
because of her appearance, because of her class...

39
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:42,740
All these things are going inside, what about this, I have a tumor, shall I marry...

40
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:48,930
You understand what is going on eventually in the mind of that person, how much

41
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:56,430
confusion and how that is expressed through this anxiety about everything.

42
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:04,260
So it is not a hypochondriacal anxiety, it is not only centering around the health of the

43
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:15,260
person but it can center around everything.

44
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:27,410
All these thoughts together with some problems in the house, in my family lead me to take

45
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,170
again tranquilizers.

46
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:40,010
For quite some time afterwards I went to a neurologist, the symptoms were worry,

47
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:47,000
irritability, tendency to nausea, I could not eat, fixed ideas etc.

48
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:55,260
He gave me Tavor and afterwards by telephone he gave me Seroten 10 mg.

49
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,500
In the beginning I was doing well and then for one year, 1979-1980 I had problems with

50
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,750
the family. My parents do not want my fiancé, also thoughts that I may not satisfy her

51
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:16,540
sexually. He writes "quick seminal discharge" underlines it three times and

52
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,500
 "not good erection"

53
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,000
This is what he writes himself, all this is exactly what he writes and how he writes it.

54
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:36,260
Small genitalia, at least I thought I had small genitalia, to divorce or not to divorce?

55
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,040
-He is not married yet.

56
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:50,730
-No, he is not married yet. To divorce means with his fiancé and the doctor who examined

57
00:08:50,830 --> 00:09:00,210
him said his genitalia is quite normal, no problem.

58
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:09,750
Actually after one year of treatment this man got married, after we treated him.

59
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:19,290
One year afterwards he married finally.

60
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:25,550
Constriction of the throat, as a result tendency to vomit with the least emotion.

61
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:31,050
Because of too many thoughts and a fixed idea, should I divorce or should I not divorce

62
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:36,000
her. One person was telling me one thing and

63
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,800
another person was telling me another thing.

64
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:48,330
There came a kind of buzzing with my head, a constricted feeling and I had the impression

65
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,580
at that moment that my blood pressure was coming up.

66
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:02,650
Then there was a hit of the tongue and then I lose my memory.

67
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:13,660
I don't know anymore what I'm doing, life is becoming idiotic. It was very difficult to

68
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,820
overcome this crisis and many times I would call my sister to keep me company and then I

69
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,320
would relate to her my problems. She would understand me and the fears would go

70
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:35,150
away. The fear of being mad would go away, so slowly she calms me down and then I take

71
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,820
the Tavor and I go to sleep.

72
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,830
In the morning when I wake up I have spasms in the stomach since 1970 and the

73
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:59,580
intestines even in the fast as if I can...

74
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,160
Also if I see somebody else while I'm eating, I can not eat because I have a timidity, I can

75
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,940
not have somebody watching me while I'm eating.

76
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,690
As soon as I have an emotional shock my stomach becomes cramped I have nausea and

77
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:24,220
vertigo. I have to throw up everything and after throwing up I have problems with my

78
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,220
stomach which is painful because it is empty.

79
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,440
I start feeling that I'm not well because I'm not going to eat and I'm going to lose weight

80
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:41,190
and if I lose weight, then my nervous condition shall be very seriously sick and then I

81
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:57,440
become worse. I go to the doctor who gives me ... and finally by the time he is in the

82
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:04,190
allopathic, he takes 6 drugs says the doctor.

83
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:13,270
He has tremendous and unexpected reactions. I have vertigos as a kind of explosion,

84
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:19,850
tremendous worriness, I eat very little, almost nothing and I have great anxiety about my

85
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:25,110
future, I'm not going to stand it anymore and I'm going crazy, I'm going to have a brain

86
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:36,810
stroke. Tahycardias, arrhythmias, sleeplessness, the advice of the doctor: have patience.

87
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:42,320
That's the advice of the doctor.

88
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:51,330
By telephone the doctor gives him Stedon, I sleep and I become better, I become like a

89
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,420
chicken.

90
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:04,070
I didn't want to drink at all, I don't want anything, tremendous sleeplessness.

91
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:10,100
My father died and I had a whole change of situation, I had palpitation and trembling,

92
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:16,080
when I'm lying down and if I don't sleep I think I'm going to become sick and because of

93
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,320
that palpitation I feel that my heart is in my stomach.

94
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:27,080
Numbness of the head and a kind of tremor going through my head, some numbness on

95
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:35,330
the tongue. If I lie down and I don't sleep at night, I feel trembling of all my body and the

96
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:44,320
extremities and I had to stretch my body and I can not sleep. Perhaps I sleep a little.

97
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:51,490
Other symptom, as if I have spasm in hands and in the feet, some difficulty in

98
00:13:51,590 --> 00:14:03,220
concentration with a certain book. I can not stand up or sit but I feel as if I want to move all

99
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:10,300
the time and would satisfy me if I move all the time, I go up and down, I don't want to stay

100
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:16,550
in the house but neither to go somewhere else. Nothing pleases me. I go there and

101
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:22,050
immediately I want to leave and go to another place. I don't know what I want.

102
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:30,390
When I see my fiancé I calm down for a while and if we go for a walk, it would be better.

103
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:37,890
I have a fear for new places, for instance they told me you go to England. I don't go. I'm

104
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:43,750
afraid of what shall I face there, how shall I eat since I can't eat in front of others and finally

105
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:50,000
if I go I shall die because I shall not be able to eat.

106
00:14:50,100 --> 00:15:01,840
I have a kind of pessimism for everything that nothing exists but sickness, desperation,

107
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:12,330
that something is going to happen to me etc. Shall I never be well? Shall I go to a doctor or

108
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:18,520
shall I not? Is he going to give me a medicine or is he going to send me to hospital? Or

109
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:29,920
perhaps to the insane asylum? Or shall I have a brain stroke and 'finito'?

110
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:46,920
Finally he asks, does in my case perhaps there is a pathological background in my case?

111
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:54,750
Sexual pathology because my sperm is very little? If I take a medicine shall I be able to

112
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,090
have children?

113
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:15,090
I brought you that because you tend when you take a case like that, to say that's a

114
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:21,920
symptom you go and look it up, the next symptom you go and look it up, finally the whole

115
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:31,170
Materia Medica is jumping in front of your. You can forget it.

116
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:37,250
There are symptoms indicating remedies if you take them word by word.

117
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:44,170
The symptom which you take out of all this what in the Repertory is called hypochondriacal

118
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:51,170
anxiety. The hypochondriacal anxiety about everything.

119
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:58,420
If he can exist in London, can I go there, how can I eat, I'm going to have a heart attack,

120
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:03,290
I'm going to have a brain stroke, anything you can think of.

121
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:16,830
Now that case describes one remedy only and it is beautiful and the whole picture cleared

122
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:37,080
up and after a year he married. Can anybody tell me what is the remedy?

123
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,080
-Nitric acid.

124
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:46,830
-Nitric acid. Who agrees with Nitric acid?

125
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,590
-Another?

126
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,920
-Arsenicum.

127
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:54,670
-Who agrees with Arsenicum?

128
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,250
-Phosphorus.

129
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:03,500
Who agrees Phosphorus?

130
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,250
-Gratiola.

131
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:15,600
-Who agrees with Gratiola?

132
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,000
-Kali Arsenicum.

133
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:24,750
-Who agrees with Kali Arsenicum?

134
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,750
-Lycopodium.

135
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:33,500
-Who agrees with Lycopodium? Another?

136
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,290
-Lobelia.

137
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:44,760
-Who agrees with Lobelia? Nobody.

138
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:59,180
It is a difficult decision between perhaps Arsenicum and Phosphorus.

139
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:17,250
You are always concerned that I may be analyse two remedies and then I say take Thuja.

140
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:25,500
No, this is not the case. This is a choice between Arsenicum and Phosphorus.

141
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:36,000
There is something which can differentiate that this is not this and it is that between the

142
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,850
two remedies.

143
00:19:53,020 --> 00:20:13,410
You are in favor of Phosphorus.

144
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:57,770
-...He never can focus, he seems to be everywhere.

145
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:12,420
-The hand writing is of Arsenicum.

146
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:34,740
-No, this is the hand writing of the person, he just said it to tape, I have translated in

147
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:42,390
English because it was not written in English, it was written in Greek. Actually it's a pity I

148
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,040
did not take the original, I could read on the spot here but she had missed some points

149
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,540
which were very interested.

150
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,540
-Did you say he is thirstless?

151
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,870
-I don't remember. Did I say that?

152
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:24,230
Arsenicum is thirsty also, basically it is a thirsty remedy like Phosphorus. They like to drink

153
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,730
a lot of water, cold water.

154
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:38,560
Sometimes of course Arsenicum wants warm water and warm food.

155
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:55,050
Great timidity.

156
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:06,310
In order to really understand him, what we want to understand is the real depth of his

157
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:15,060
character because we have some points in favor of Arsenicum and certain points in favor

158
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,640
of Phosphorus.

159
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:25,970
We want to go deeper as much as possible to differentiate between Arsenicum and

160
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:31,010
Phosphorus.

161
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:58,220
From the remedy pictures who has read Arsenicum from me? Phosphorus also? OK.

162
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:13,010
From what I said and from the impression which will come out as a person, who is more

163
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:16,310
composed?

164
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,300
-Arsenicum.

165
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,810
-Who is more diffused?

166
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,140
-Phosphorus.

167
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:30,390
-Who is more sympathetic and who is more hard?

168
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:44,230
You see real deep down there is an element of naivety, of sympathetic, of concerned for all

169
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:53,980
kinds of things but it is not this calculated. It comes out exactly the opposite, it is not

170
00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:07,310
calculated, it is somebody who just lost himself, should I marry her, a grown up man asked

171
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:20,890
the first doctor, should I marry that girl? Imagine because I didn't see the person.

172
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:34,850
Arsenicum would never do that. And then I must telephone the sister...

173
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:47,600
How do you feel? I feel very badly. It's the sister, it's anybody.

174
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:54,840
Phosphorus can be pleased by anybody.

175
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:01,060
Arsenicum wants specific and he wants to know that this person knows what he is talking

176
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:16,920
about and he is not so much easily persuaded that there is nothing the matter.

177
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:26,840
I must be near my husband.

178
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:35,340
If you have really worked with these cases, with these characters, you will not make the

179
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,580
mistake but of course I have seen perhaps 10.000 cases of Phosphorus and another

180
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:50,630
10.000 of Arsenicum and that's why I can pick up elements easier.

181
00:26:50,730 --> 00:27:02,170
I immediately prescribed Phosphorus, it's a matter of experience but do you see this?

182
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:06,370
Do you see the difference? Arsenicum is much harder, he will have that tremendous

183
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:15,960
anxiety, fear of death, fear about his disease, not so much concerned about the others,

184
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:27,840
should I marry, should I not marry? This does not arise so much for Arsenicum while for

185
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:41,170
Phosphorus, something is going to happen very strongly and another thing is, they say

186
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:45,120
fear of insanity in the Book.

187
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:55,120
Phosphorus and Arsenicum are both there and you know that the capital is Pulsatilla and

188
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,900
Calcarea and Mancinella and Cannabis indica.

189
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:12,030
Not everyone of these remedies will tell you I have a fear of insanity.

190
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:19,790
The remedy that will tell you most easily, that will express that is Pulsatilla and

191
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:24,880
Phosphorus.

192
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:31,200
Cannabis indica will never pronounce that word, you don't expect to get that expression,

193
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:36,200
fear of losing my brains. No.

194
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:43,820
They will go this way and that way to tell you that finally I want to have control.

195
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:51,040
Control of what? Of others and of myself.

196
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:58,790
I want to have control is the positive of I have a tremendous fear I may lose control.

197
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:05,320
What I don't want to say that I may lose control and they say I want control but to such a

198
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:11,820
tremendous extend that you translate it into fear of insanity.

199
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,070
Pulsatilla may say and Phosphorus.

200
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:28,790
Calcarea you try to get what is there. Tremendous anxiety and I just don't feel well.

201
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:39,030
Tell me. You have to tell her, do you have fear of insanity perhaps? She says yes.

202
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:45,380
It's a relief that you told her, you understood what was going on.

203
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:56,370
Mancinella will describe it as a stormy condition in the brain overtaken by situation where

204
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:05,870
the devils are concerned and the hell is concerned and what have I do, my life is this and

205
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:17,210
that and I'm going crazy. This is the idea because of the hell and of this and that.

206
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:24,290
It's not the first one will tell you. He will tell you all kinds of other descriptions and

207
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:29,620
psychological states which lead towards that portion and then you will have to take it down

208
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:40,690
and say yes. Do you have fear that you may lose your mind?

209
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:07,350
But almost except of Phosphorus, perhaps more the Pulsatilla, they will tell you straight

210
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:18,360
because they don't mind, they have contact, they can say anything, they will tell you

211
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:25,610
straight, it doesn't' matter for them. It is the kind of sympathy which they have for others,

212
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:48,050
they feel that others have for them. It's a state of mind where it is not protected from the

213
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:55,800
skepticism of others.

214
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:15,450
When somebody does not understand that the other person is thinking badly about him.

215
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,530
-Paranoia.

216
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:26,110
-No. He does not understand. You have the impression that if you say something bad, it

217
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:33,200
may be taken badly from the other person and he may interpret what you say and you

218
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:38,200
think that instead of this and you have all this in your mind and you don't say it.

219
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,950
This process does not exist in most of the Phosphorus cases.

220
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:51,990
They say it, no matter how you take it, he thinks you will take it rightly. He has no this

221
00:32:52,090 --> 00:33:11,030
suspicion that you may misunderstand him.

222
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:27,530
'Ypopsia' is suspicion. He does not get suspicious about you, that you may be thinking

223
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:36,530
badly about him, that's why he is open, he will tell you I think I'm mad, I'm losing my mind,

224
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:44,030
he will not care whether you will go around and say he is losing his mind.

225
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:50,030
-Genuine.

226
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:59,040
-He is genuine, trusting where Arsenicum is not.

227
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:09,570
That element is very strong in him, he goes and says, tell me what to do, I must take this

228
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:17,570
and take that, do you think I have some pathology? OK I don't have.

229
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:26,360
This type of person is Phosphorus.

230
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:33,620
Some time ago somebody has asked me what is hypochondriacal anxiety and I tried to

231
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:40,620
describe it but when you try to describe it, it comes out ...

232
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:50,370
So you understand now what is hypochondriacal anxiety, what is meant when we go and

233
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:56,720
look in the Repertory for that symptom.
