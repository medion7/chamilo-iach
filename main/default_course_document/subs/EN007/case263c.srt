1
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:46,210
-So since May you got no medicine and tell us what happened.

2
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,950
-Generally if I summarize all this year, since the first remedy which was in September

3
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,530
last year, the main problem remained the same, no change.

4
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:00,050
Actually I see some kind of aggravation. It's slightly worse I think.

5
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,120
-What you consider the main problem?

6
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:10,280
-The main problem is an inflammation in the prostate, in the area of the scar.

7
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,610
There was an operation 10 years ago of hernia. Since then there is a pain in the scar

8
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:26,030
of the operation and since then I think there is inflammation at the area of the scar

9
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,470
and I think it's in the prostate but I can't be sure about it.

10
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,360
-When was the operation?
-10 years ago.

11
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,140
-Where?
-On the left side on the inguinal area.

12
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:56,370
-You had a hernia left side on inguinal hernia and there you have a pain.

13
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:06,120
-Since then there is a lot of pain in the scar itself. Many times there is a sharp pain

14
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,450
and I need to press the scar and to bend like this and then the pain is relieved.

15
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:20,040
Otherwise I can't, it's really very painful and I feel that around the scar there is

16
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,530
some inflammation which I can't be sure where it is exactly.

17
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,390
I feel it's somehow related to the scar.

18
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:41,700
-But how you say prostate? Is the same pain that you attribute to the prostate gland?

19
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:47,360
-Whenever there is an effort to give stool, then there is some discharge coming out

20
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:53,300
and they examined the discharge and it represents inflammation in some place.

21
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03,120
They took sample of the discharge, they examined it and they found out inflammation

22
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,230
signs in the discharge.

23
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,320
-But when did they take this?
-2 years ago.

24
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:16,140
-Not again.
-1 year ago as well, I don't remember exactly when.

25
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,570
-But not now.
-Not lately.

26
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,720
-What other problems?

27
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,730
-Generally there was constipation which has gradually improved.

28
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:49,810
Right now there is tendency to constipation but it's much compared to what it used to be.

29
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,970
There used to be very severe weakness last year, right now is slightly better.

30
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,730
I don't feel as I used to be but it's slightly better compared to last year.

31
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:08,650
-When you say slightly, can you put it in percent?
-40% better.

32
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,050
-Then what else?

33
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:21,720
-I went to India this summer, over there I got sick a few times and the process of

34
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,470
getting sick is always the same for me. First day I'm very weak, second day there is

35
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,740
pain throughout the joints and then there is a severe diarrhea.

36
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,140
This kind of cycle happened for 4 times in India and the 4th time I had no time to let it go

37
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:47,240
by itself, so I took one dose of Mercury 200C and then within one hour everything had gone away.

38
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,410
All the pain, all the weakness, within one hour everything was finished.

39
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,010
-Did you have fever as well?
-Yes.

40
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,460
-How much fever?

41
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:04,460
-Slight, not too much, maybe 38, 37.5, not too much.

42
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,790
-Did you have any excessive salivation?
-It comes and goes.

43
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,950
There is period where I see more signs of it and there is period which I don't see

44
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,720
any sign whatsoever.

45
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,450
-How is your psychological condition?

46
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:35,370
-Since last year when you gave me the remedy, I feel generally everything is less extreme

47
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:40,800
and the tendency to be extreme somehow became very mild.

48
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:49,360
When you gave me the remedy last year I felt that my personality wants to do

49
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,380
something in extreme fashion but the body, the organism stopped me.

50
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:01,370
I felt to go to study, let's say 24 hrs the day, but after 5 hrs I collapse, I sleep.

51
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:08,360
I felt as if the body does not allow me anymore to be in extreme and this kind of thing is still now,

52
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,780
I feel that all the extremes things in my life become more and more mild.

53
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,610
-All this tendency you had to do extreme things because you did a lot of extreme things

54
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:26,870
this has vanished totally or still there is some memory of that?

55
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,380
Sometimes you will say why don't I do that thing?

56
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,560
-My tendency generally is to put all myself in what I'm doing, like right now if I'm in

57
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,280
Homeopathy I will put all my energy into it, day and night, this is the tendency.

58
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,940
But I feel that after the remedy the organism does not allow me to do it.

59
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,770
After a few hours of doing something, something will happen. I will fall asleep

60
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,030
spontaneously, I will feel very hungry, I must go to eat, something will change.

61
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:04,880
I can't be in the same pattern of being so excessive about something.

62
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:18,370
As well something which changed, I used to be very protective, as if everybody is an enemy

63
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,750
in the Repertory...

64
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,300
-I remember that.

65
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:31,450
-Right now is less, I feel this tendency is less but generally I feel this tendency of feeling

66
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,960
as if people...

67
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,930
-They can't hurt you.

68
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:43,780
-This is less but I feel right now there is tendency of sadness and some tendency of depression,

69
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,510
which is more than as it used to be.

70
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:56,110
-This sadness has a reason? You are sad because you can not go there or you cannot

71
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:02,030
do this or that or it is, you would say, without any reason?

72
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:12,840
-There are two things in it. When I feel very tired or exhausted, it is followed by sadness.

73
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,010
I have tendency to be sad or depressed when I feel very tired physically.

74
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,690
Let's say I worked or learned for many hours.

75
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,520
-After physical exertion you feel sad?

76
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:34,260
-Whenever I feel weak, physically or mentally after hard work, generally comes with certain kind

77
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,600
of depression or sadness or want to be alone, leave me alone, don't touch me or engage with me

78
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:52,850
and then I have tendency to speak very fast, very hasty speech and to want to be by myself.

79
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,500
Then there is another thing.

80
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,080
I feel that this sadness relates to certain kind of feeling in myself, where I feel that I want

81
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:11,170
to express something and it's very difficult for me to express it emotionally or socially.

82
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:19,430
I feel as if in me there is a wall that I can't break through and that thing makes me more sad.

83
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,850
Do you understand what I'm saying?
-Yes.

84
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,340
What else was there and there are other changes?

85
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:48,420
-In me I used to be very aggressive, with more anger, with tendency of negativity and

86
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:56,850
right now I feel that all this is much less. I don't so much tend to explode in myself.

87
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:12,670
As well I feel as if there is in me two parts. One part is very mature, very old, almost too

88
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:20,930
old, as if I'm going to old too soon and one part is very childish, very young, needs protection,

89
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:26,860
needs somebody to protect me, there are two sides.

90
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:35,920
The one is as if I'm getting old too quick, as if I'm not in my age, 45 whatever...

91
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,470
-You are 45 now?
-No, 30.

92
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,510
-You feel as if you are 45.

93
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,000
-And from the other hand I feel as if I'm very young, like 5 years old, need protection

94
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,260
and need to be hugged.

95
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:09,770
-Did you have any change in temperature wise? You became more warm, more cold?

96
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:19,180
-I think generally more cold. In my basic constitution I think I'm very hot.

97
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,990
When I was younger, I used to perspire a lot and to be very hot in the body, I used even

98
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:31,750
to take the bathing suit, in the winter and take a shower in the rain, I was so hot.

99
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,850
Right now it's more cold.

100
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,490
-Would you say that now you cry more or you cry more easily?

101
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:52,020
-Generally it's very difficult for me to cry, I can't really say.

102
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:03,410
I can say that until the age of 12 or 13 I used to cry a lot, I used to be a very crying boy

103
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:08,930
and something around 12,13 completely stopped cying.

104
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:17,830
-It was out of an indication by your mother or your father, he did something to stop you

105
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,350
or by yourself?

106
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:31,250
-People around, the social situation was such that people were laughing at me when I was crying,

107
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:41,570
so there was a few situations where I was very offended, I was very insulted by children in my age

108
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,840
that were laughing at me and then I got completely closed since then.

109
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,990
-How is your sleep? You sleep how many hours?

110
00:12:52,090 --> 00:13:02,010
-Sometimes when I 'm after many hours of work, I can sleep 10-11 hours, even 12 hours.

111
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,770
-And you wake up refreshed from that sleep?

112
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:19,750
-I feel good but it takes me a few hours to be totally awake. It takes 3-4 hours until I will

113
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,100
be totally awake.

114
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,430
-Do you take a nap in the afternoon?
-Never.

115
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:42,600
-So most of your energy what time comes?
-More in the afternoon and night. More at night.

116
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,510
-When you say night, after 8 o'clock or after 11 o'clock?

117
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,100
-After 9,10, then I feel that my concentration is much stronger.

118
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,600
For me learning is the best early in the morning or late at night.

119
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:18,180
-After 10,11,12 you feel awake or early in the morning, as soon as you wake up.

120
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:24,160
But this is opposite to what you said because you wake up and you are not awake and

121
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,920
you need 4 hours.

122
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,600
-But still I can be very drowsy but I can be very concentrated.

123
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,170
-In the evening you feel also better psychologically, emotionally?

124
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:46,010
-Always for me in the evening and night I feel better, even my confidence is better.

125
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:53,770
-How is your confidence in comparison with before?
-Improved, better.

126
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,940
-Do you feel more calm in general inside, more in peace with yourself?

127
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:15,350
-Generally yes. I feel more as you said. I used to be very agitated in myself.

128
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,260
Very irritable.

129
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,910
-Is any change in your desires-aversions for food?

130
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:42,060
-Lately I feel less need to eat, I don't feel so much to eat and I feel more need for meat

131
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:52,490
and for yogurt and for sweets. Sweets are always there for me.

132
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,070
There is always a desire for sweets.

133
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,410
-What about salt?

134
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:12,680
-Much less than it used to be, as well thirst much less than it used to be and as well with thirst,

135
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:21,340
there is more need for hot drinks. Because the temperature of the body is tends to be cold,

136
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,270
I feel like warming the body with hot drinks.

137
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:47,010
-You remember that you had an eruption coming out.

138
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:53,690
-Yes, there was two waves this summer, on the forehead, around the nose, behind the ears.

139
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,170
-Waves you said?

140
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:05,100
-Yes, twice this summer, as a wave, it came twice. One month ago and three months ago

141
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,110
coming and going, for 1-2 weeks and then it went away by itself.

142
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,430
-When you were in India, what time?

143
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:22,110
-May after we finished the course in May and then in July and August.

144
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,850
-You were in India, so the shin eruption came while you were in India.

145
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:36,530
-Yes and later on in Israel.

146
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:50,360
-Did you have this eruption after Mercury or before taking Mercury?

147
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,560
-Before and after.

148
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,520
As well there was a funny symptom which came a few times.

149
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:12,110
There was one symptom where I felt spontaneous tears coming and it feels like oil.

150
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:26,680
Lacrimation from the eyes and feels like oil, like cream and another thing which I noticed,

151
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:37,280
which is very strange, I sit or walk and I feel as if somebody is pouring cold water.

152
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,960
-Where? In the back?

153
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,680
-Through the body, shoulders, hands, feet and then I'm looking and the area is dry

154
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,920
and always it's surprising me, just sitting and feel somebody is pouring water and

155
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,870
then I look and the area is dry.

156
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,100
-You have the sensation of cold water.

157
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,100
-As if somebody is coming and pouring cold water, like this.

158
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,920
-In the whole body or in your feet, sometimes in the back?

159
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:10,590
-More in the extremities or legs but it can be anywhere. This has happened many times

160
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:13,370
and I remember it seemed to happen when I was child.

161
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:24,060
-This time is as strong as that time when you were a child?

162
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,980
-Now it's much more actually and it's very surprising me. I'm sitting very relaxed

163
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,070
or I'm walking and I feel actual sensation, as if someone is taking a glass of cold water

164
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,080
and pouring on me...

165
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:45,920
I'm looking and touching this, feel cold water but ... I'm amazed by it.

166
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:01,820
As well sometimes during the summer there was a few situations where I felt that I'm becoming

167
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:11,250
very sensitive, very delicate and as if the vibration of noise comes through my body,

168
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,660
as if I'm transparent.

169
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:45,090
It's feeling more the sensation of drops, not the whole water.

170
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,670
-Do you get any cramps in your legs?
-No.

171
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:51,730
-You feel that you have become more sensitive, you mean in your health, your strength

172
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,080
or emotional sense?

173
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:00,490
-My feeling is more a matter of spiritual and emotional sensitivity.

174
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:08,400
I can feel things which are very delicate, like I feel your vibration, if there is a noise,

175
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,320
I feel the vibration of the noise entering the body and leaving the body,

176
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,410
as if the body is more transparent.

177
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:23,550
As if I'm not in the body and I can feel things which are outside, entering and leaving.

178
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:32,780
-But would you say that this is a feeling like clairvoyance? That means you feel the

179
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,970
vibrations of the other person and you feel that this is happening or that is happening?

180
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:49,200
-Not so much, it's like let's say I feel the wind, sometimes coming through the body and

181
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:55,550
leave the body or the noise, I actually feel the vibration.

182
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:13,190
-But in your education, studies you have been taught, because you were doing healing

183
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,700
you have been taught to perceive this?

184
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:22,450
-Yes, for many years. Still I'm doing this.

185
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:32,120
-But this feeling has become more? You are more sensitized you would say?

186
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:42,620
-Yes, more easy to perceive vibration of different things and people also.

187
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,120
-You are in a hurry feeling inside?
-Generally yes.

188
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:16,450
The tendency is to feel as if I'm late always, as if I need to accomplish things

189
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,050
before whatever will happen.

190
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:51,280
As well this summer was much more back pain. I have a back pain for many years and

191
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:56,610
the lumbar region is very easy for me to pick the stress.

192
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:11,370
Whenever I'm in any kind of tiredness or stress the lower back will be painful, will feel unease,

193
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,560
will feel something is wrong over there.

194
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:26,050
-How is the perspiration? You perspire more?
-Not more than usual, actually less.

195
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:33,740
-And does the perspiration bothers you? It makes you feel uneasy, irritated?

196
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,550
-Generally yes, it feels very humid and hot area, I will feel very unpleasant with perspiration.

197
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:50,210
If I'm in a climate where I perspire a lot, I don't feel good.

198
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:59,380
-Do you have problems with your gums, teeth?

199
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,460
-The gums sometimes tend to bleed and sometimes tend to swell.

200
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:10,700
-When you say sometimes? Once the week or once the month?

201
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,380
-Once the month and when they swell, it becomes very painful.

202
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,120
-When did you have last time the swelling?

203
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,970
-A few days ago.

204
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:31,050
-It comes and goes like this?
-Maybe once the month or once every two months.

205
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:38,120
-Do you have salivation during sleep?

206
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:44,090
-Yes but that thing as well for the last two months I didn't have and for the last few

207
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:49,140
days I have, so I can't really say.

208
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,370
-Your breath is offensive?

209
00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:00,030
-If I don't eat nothing in the morning, then after a few hours it will be heavy breath.

210
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,890
If I eat in the morning, then no problem.

211
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,880
-What about the taste in your mouth, do you have any particular taste?

212
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,300
-Not particularly.

213
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,130
-Metallic taste?
-No.

214
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:31,870
-The skin eruption the last time how long it lasted?
-About 5 days, 1 week.

215
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,330
The pattern of the skin eruptions is always very much the same

216
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:50,890
it's red, the skin becomes very rough ,very scratchy, I have to scratch it a lot.

217
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:00,140
When you touch it very gently, you feel good but if you scratch a little bit, it's very painful.

218
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:18,140
And it feels like you take a cube of ice to put on it, it's burning, you want to cool it down.

219
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:26,040
-How do you feel in here? Do you go to the sea? Do you swim?

220
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,960
When you arrived here in Alonissos, did you go to swim?

221
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,130
-No.

222
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,140
-The previous years you have swam in the sea?
-Yes but I'm not so much in favor.

223
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,620
-You do not care about swimming?

224
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:50,470
-Not much, I'm afraid of the cold lately more than usual, I know it will be cold.

225
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:07,810
-When did you notice this oily lacrimation?
-When I was in India.

226
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,810
-Your perspiration is not so oily now?

227
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:27,720
-If I'm heavily perspiring, then it's normal but if I'm perspiring slightly, then it's more

228
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:33,230
like cream, it's a creamy perspiration.

229
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:59,040
-Extremities are cold, hot, especially or they follow the body?

230
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,090
-They follow the body.

231
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,480
-Do you ever stick your feet out of cover?
-Never.

232
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:15,390
-Any problem looking down from high places?
-Never.

233
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:32,510
-Would you say that you are suppressed? I mean from you mother, father, your girlfriend

234
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:38,290
and you are easily suppressed, you don't express your anger?

235
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,310
You get angry and you don't express it?

236
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:48,730
-Generally I feel more suppressed than not suppressed.

237
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:58,790
Not easy for me to express anger or any emotion and the anger in me will be aggregated,

238
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:06,990
aggregated and then it will explode. It won't come, I feel angry I will shout immediately.

239
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,800
It will aggregate.

240
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:14,070
-You keep it inside.
-And then after some time it will...

241
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,130
-And then what you can do? You can throw things?

242
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:36,400
-No, I will shout, criticize, I won't come to a violent state but I will be shout a lot.

243
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,810
-Are you especially afraid of physical pain?
-No.

244
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,180
-Very good.

245
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,400
-You have conclusion?

246
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:26,920
-It is very interesting in his case and something which is quite clear in his case is that

247
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:35,340
you know Mercury cannot stand extremes of temperature.

248
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:52,580
Mercury cases feel bad in extremes of temperatures, either cold or hot.

249
00:35:55,910 --> 00:36:06,980
And he says, my character is to go to the extremes, that means the organism has

250
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:13,730
the tendency to go to extremes. You apply cold, it goes to the extremes it becomes very cold.

251
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,000
You apply heat, it goes to the extremes it becomes very hot.

252
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:25,310
The same thing is happened psychologically. It's very interesting for me also because the

253
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:40,820
first time I hear it, the way he described it, extreme sensitivity of Mercury.

254
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:47,650
Applying cold, becoming very cold, I cannot stand it, applying heat, I can not stand it.

255
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:58,660
And he has it in his character and he says, now I'm more balanced, not so extreme.

256
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:08,480
So it's the first time I had this expression and I wanted to make you aware of that

257
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:19,070
possibility. Yet you should not try to find this element in every Mercury case because

258
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:30,090
I don't believe that you see it again, unless you push the patient to say these things.

259
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:50,750
The question with this case is this. Mercury has done everything it could do for him?

260
00:37:51,250 --> 00:38:01,330
Still Mercury is indicated or another remedy is indicated or placebo is indicated?

261
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:05,990
So this the question that we have to solve with his case.

262
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:17,750
Is he going to another remedy does he need to go higher on Mercury or we need to wait?

263
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:42,650
You see the dilemmas because he is doing quite well on mental, emotional and physical.

264
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:54,990
The whole organism is coming back to balance, yet the pathology remains, is it worse or

265
00:38:55,090 --> 00:39:01,250
is it the same or it is a bit better?

266
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:09,420
5-10% better or worse or 20% worse, what is it?

267
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:24,570
-The last 10 years, every year there is gradual aggravation and as well this year I see

268
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:28,670
that it continues, there is more aggravation generally.

269
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:33,420
It's not too much but still I can see a line of aggravation.

270
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:43,250
-So actually it's becoming worse but little worse.

271
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:56,490
-10-20%. As well something which I forgot to mention, the last 2 months there is a sensation of water

272
00:39:56,590 --> 00:40:05,330
in the right ear. When I walk or when I move my hand, I feel as if the right ear is full of water.

273
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:09,170
I can feel the movement, I don't know if it means anything.

274
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:22,420
-Sensation of water in the right ear, has anybody found it?

275
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:42,510
Antimonium crudum, Graphites, Menyanthes, Spigelia and Sulphur.

276
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:58,250
In the left ear? Only the right ear, Chromic acid, it comes and disappears suddenly.

277
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:24,590
-We have found it in chapter chill water.

278
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,920
-Where, in the back?
-Over the body.

279
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,840
-Chills as if water? What is the rubric?
-In chill.

280
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:13,610
-There is another rubric poured over him.
-It's like small drops of rain.

281
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,860
-Can we take it?

282
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:39,280
-It's not a matter of taking or not taking. When you study the case, you have to battle

283
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:48,930
and search all the Materia Medica to see if you can find exactly the symptom which the person has.

284
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:56,920
Search the whole Materia Medica because that may give you the clue of the issue.

285
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:18,590
Why do we search for this symptom? Why do we spend so much time?

286
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,990
-Because it's peculiar and new.

287
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:39,070
-Why do we search and spend so much time on that stupid symptom?

288
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:48,810
-Because it's 153 symptom.

289
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:15,220
-Because it's a new symptom and we are interested, is he going to another remedy?

290
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:21,950
What kind of remedy? How do we find if he is going towards a new remedy?

291
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:28,060
It is the new symptoms which will point out whether he is going towards a new remedy.

292
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:47,230
It seems that a lot of remedies have this symptom. Aconitum, Glonoinum...

293
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:57,800
and Thuja.

294
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,380
-Trinkling in many parts, this is what he said, he said sometimes is here, it's in

295
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,590
different parts.

296
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:27,790
-If this symptom belongs to Mercury, it is a different thing than belonging to another

297
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:39,210
remedy. If it belongs to another remedy, is it enough for us to prescribe on the strength

298
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:41,470
of that little symptom?

299
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:53,210
No. It's not correct that we jump into the picture and we just give him a dose of Thuja because

300
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,560
he has that peculiar symptom.

301
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:10,040
So his picture, in order to give Thuja, his picture of Mercury has to slowly disappear

302
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:15,810
go out and the picture of the other remedy has to come in.

303
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,310
What do you do?

304
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:50,120
-I would like to ask if this sensation of being transparent does bother him or not and how

305
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:56,960
would you explain George? Would you take this as a hint or as a symptom or not?

306
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,140
How do you see this?

307
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:12,050
-The sensation of Thuja is that of brittle, they can describe it in different ways.

308
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:24,820
Mostly they describe it concerning the spine, the vertebrae that are fragile.

309
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:39,890
If I move, suddenly my vertebrae might break or I'm fragile, made out of glass.

310
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:48,130
So we have to investigate whether this is the sensation what he said transparent or

311
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:54,900
he means a totally different concept.

312
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:17,300
-I feel as if I'm stepping outside of myself and I feel that the body is just empty and

313
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:24,380
things coming in, going out and I'm just standing aside and observe it without any

314
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:32,980
feeling to it and the body is very transparent, very hollow.

315
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:42,060
-It's not the Thuja feeling.

316
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:49,650
-This is a feeling of Cannabis indica.

317
00:48:50,720 --> 00:49:03,620
-Yes, this is a feeling of Cannabis indica or Cannabis sativa and if Cannabis sativa

318
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:21,550
has the feeling of drops as well but the sensation is single drops and it's very clear

319
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:27,900
sensation. He looks, am I wet many times.

320
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:41,720
-It happened once when I was sitting in a bar and suddenly I feel as if there is drop of

321
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,720
cold water on my shoulder and I was jumping from the chair to catch the man who

322
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:50,900
is throwing cold water on my shoulder. And then I see it's nobody, I check it's dry.

323
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:11,800
-It's quite clear, quite strong symptom. Still you say the prostatic fluid is running out

324
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:16,060
when you press for stool? It's still running out?

325
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:20,060
-That thing still happens, still there.

326
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,400
-As much as before, less or more?

327
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,150
-I think it's either the same or more, definitely not less.

328
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:36,730
And the quality of the discharge is very sticky, like what you described as Kali bichromicum,

329
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:38,810
very stringy.

330
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,650
-It's not so easy.

331
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:39,990
Except of the pain, which is the other symptom that bothers you?

332
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,240
You will say that symptom bothers me also.

333
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:52,730
-The symptom which bothers me the most is the pain of the scar. Once more, if it's very painful

334
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:58,240
I have to bend down and to press it and then the pain is relieved, only like that.

335
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:04,490
If I do like this, the pain will be aggravated. If I bend forward it's better.

336
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,390
-And lasts how long?

337
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:10,820
-Maybe 1 min, maybe 5 min and then it will go away.

338
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:17,910
-Pain on the scar you have it? Cicatrices?

339
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:28,480
-As well there is another symptom, every time when I'm growing my hair there will be

340
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:34,220
a lot of dandruff and then it will develop into skin rashes. This is why I always cut the hair

341
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:38,740
because if it goes a little bit then full of dandruff, like snow.

342
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:42,640
-Dry?

343
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:48,490
-Very dry and then it develops immediately into...  or eczema.

344
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:53,810
-And then it will be oily the eczema?

345
00:52:55,830 --> 00:53:08,080
-Burning sensation, red and dry sometimes, more oily but sometimes I see an area which is very dry.

346
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:48,570
-There is a rubric with this bending forward ameliorates in the generalities.

347
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:52,070
That's what he said, right? He bends forward and he feels better.

348
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:59,500
-It's the pressure, the pain is relieved by the pressure, pain in abdomen relieved by pressing.

349
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:09,580
So if you want to find pain bending double, ameliorates pressing you can be looking.

350
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:33,900
You see Staphysagria is one of the remedies which has pain in the incision and that is one of the

351
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:46,840
remedies we can be thinking and we would have liked that he has these drops that symptom Staphysagria.

352
00:54:53,080 --> 00:55:04,320
Find this, find the type of cutting pain in abdomen, better pressure, pressure ameliorates

353
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:11,330
you don' have. Find in pain, pressure abdomen ameliorates.

354
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:24,580
It is pain cutting after operation 10 years ago, that's it no more.

355
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:53,240
-If Mercury works so well when he was acute ill in India, would it have done that if

356
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,620
it had been the right remedy?

357
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:04,820
-No, sure. The question we have now is Mercury has done all it could and now has

358
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,670
gone to the second remedy.

359
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:15,250
This is the problem and if he has gone to the second remedy what is this remedy?

360
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:21,590
And we are going to be guided by the new symptoms he has developed.

361
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:30,820
And the new symptoms he has developed are old symptoms that he had 15 years

362
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:40,010
ago, even more, 20 years ago he had that symptom.

363
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:51,910
That means 20 years ago he was on another remedy and then eventually Mercury

364
00:56:52,010 --> 00:57:00,000
came. You give Mercury and the next layer is coming up and what is the next layer?

365
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:10,090
And what you have to deal here is a scar operation.

366
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,340
What we do? Who can tell me?

367
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:55,570
These are the remedies we may be thinking, either repeating Mercury, giving Staphysagria in

368
00:57:55,670 --> 00:58:08,740
the pathology, giving Thuja because the prostate gland is affected and because he is having a strange,

369
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:17,420
rare and peculiar symptom or Thuja and Sulphur because it covers the totality of the symptoms.

370
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:35,500
And the most easy is placebo, why we bother?

371
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:49,020
We bother because we are. You are always concerned.

372
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:55,340
For me there is a problem.

373
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:09,260
He had an operation 10 years ago and he has this symptom since that time

374
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:18,000
and you give a remedy and he goes back 20 years ago when he had that symptom.

375
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:31,660
What has happened? Unless you understand really what has happened, you have a

376
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:38,670
layer, 20 years ago he had certain symptoms. Did you have warts?

377
00:59:56,350 --> 01:00:02,930
-There was one wart for long time on this finger. Maybe for 5 years.

378
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:07,340
It disappeared the last year and didn't come again.

379
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:17,570
-There was only one wart since childhood?

380
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:26,320
-I can't really recall it, maybe there was one small wart on the hand, maybe 10 years

381
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,510
ago but I can't really recall that.

382
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:38,640
There was one which I definitely remember on the finger in the right hand.

383
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:44,950
It was maybe 5-10 years in this time, I can't remember and last year

384
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:49,050
it vanished after the remedy.

385
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:19,200
-Very confusing. My thinking would be like this. He was having a layer here and then

386
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:33,130
Mercury and on this layer he had the operation. Let us say this was a Thuja layer.

387
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:42,620
On this layer he had the operation and started with the pain and then eventually this

388
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:50,720
layer changed to another layer due to certain factors in his life.

389
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:58,130
We give now Mercury and this layer seems to go away.

390
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:09,700
What is left here is the supposed Thuja layer or it is another layer upon Thuja because

391
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:12,220
of the operation, which is Staphysagria.

392
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:21,550
Do you have to give Staphysagria and then Thuja or do you have to give Thuja?

393
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:33,370
-A few months before we start to learn here and before I receive the remedy, some

394
01:02:33,470 --> 01:02:38,640
homeopath in Israel gave me Staphysagria and there was no effect whatsoever.

395
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:45,390
Otherwise I felt more tired and generally bend and I felt no good at all.

396
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:56,780
-This does not mean that this time he may not need Staphysagria.

397
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:03,040
This does not exclude the possibility of Staphysagria now after Mercury but it's good

398
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:04,970
that you give this information.

399
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:26,630
Your prostate gland has been examined?

400
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:35,210
-Yes, it was, he said it's perfectly normal, the size and everything. It's only the fluid

401
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:42,290
which comes out and in the fluid there is signs of streptococcus and staphylococcus

402
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:43,630
which represent inflammation.

403
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:51,380
-And that examination was 2 years ago or 1 year ago?

404
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,300
-Before the remedy anyhow.

405
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:04,290
-Do you have any affect on your urination?

406
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:11,630
-Sometimes if for any reason there isn't any possibility to urinate, it's accumulates

407
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:18,730
then it's very painful in the bladder and as well there is pinching pain in the urethra.

408
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:25,790
-When you go for stool, during stool do you have a running nose ever?

409
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:28,390
-No, I can't recall that.

410
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:37,120
-George, are you sure that the Mercury level is through are we looking for new remedy the picture

411
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:43,040
is not clear, only two new symptoms have been added, one for Sulphur and the other one,

412
01:04:43,140 --> 01:04:48,040
I'm not sure which remedy Thuja maybe. But he is psychologically, emotionally,

413
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:50,640
mentally so much better after Mercury.

414
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:56,790
All his physical symptoms are only slightly better or maybe not better at all, is it not worth to try

415
01:04:56,890 --> 01:05:02,040
to give one Mercury higher than the last time to see if the physical would respond to that,

416
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:04,140
before we move to another one?

417
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:11,230
-I'm afraid that if we give now Mercury, we will have no effect.

418
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:21,120
If there is a relapse, let us he goes and drinks coffee or he has an acute and the acute

419
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:32,120
brings a relapse, then Mercury will act. Now I'm afraid because of this symptom

420
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:38,460
we have the next layer, which most probably is not Mercury.

421
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:48,290
There is a possibility still is Mercury if this trickling was a symptom found in Mercury

422
01:05:48,390 --> 01:06:01,220
yes I may repeat Mercury or repeat it many times but I'm afraid that this is the underline layer.

423
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:08,370
-I'm trying to remember while you're speaking and I remembered there was a few warts

424
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:11,810
when I was very young in age, on the hands.

425
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:17,550
-How they went away?
-Spontaneously, without any treatment.

426
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:27,710
-Definitely he has some symptoms of Thuja and if you repertorize everything that we're searching,

427
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:30,810
Thuja is coming many times.

428
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:34,790
-How frequently you have this pain? Every day?

429
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:40,220
-No, it generally can come once or twice the week or sometimes once the month.

430
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:45,880
There isn't any clear pattern. Definitely it's related to stress.

431
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:55,980
Whenever I'm stressed the pain comes.
-Give him Thuja 200.

432
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:11,230
-So this is the third follow up, you had another two follow-ups.

433
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:21,320
The last one was in October 97, so two years ago you had the last follow-up

434
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:28,700
where you took, the last remedy was Thuja and the first remedy was Mercury.

435
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:34,500
Tell me this period.

436
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:40,150
-Let me evaluate. I took also other remedies apart from Mercury and Thuja.

437
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:43,960
Let me tell you what I took and what was the effect of each one of them.

438
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:53,730
Let me begin from the first. First of all Mercury, you gave me a 10M, which I told you that time,

439
01:07:53,830 --> 01:08:00,160
you didn't believe me so much, I say it again Mercury had an effect for 24 days exactly.

440
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:05,010
On the 25th day the action was absolutely finished.

441
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:10,820
What was the effect of the Mercury? Constipation was gone, I felt energy better, I felt

442
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:18,910
generally better, exactly for 24 days, I took a few doses of Mercury so I noticed that

443
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:23,070
each dose, even if it was 200 or 10M or 50M...

444
01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:26,740
-Lasted only for 24 days?
-Exactly, absolutely.

445
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,450
-That's the first time I hear that.

446
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:40,740
-With the Mercury some people said, give me a reflection if you changed, I can't really

447
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:45,080
say I felt any difference emotionally from the Mercury.

448
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:55,150
I noticed that the main problem, the scar tissue which is inflamed and the prostate gland

449
01:08:55,250 --> 01:09:02,420
also is somehow inflamed because of that, got aggravated once I was under the Mercury influence.

450
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:12,840
Then after a year you gave me Thuja 200C. The effect of the Thuja for me was very bad.

451
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:20,070
I felt very bad at any level. One day after the Thuja I got a few things which happened

452
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:26,070
immediately after Thuja, first of all constipation was gone in physical level, then I felt

453
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:32,820
for a few weeks sweet taste in the mouth, in such an extreme where everything which

454
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:38,750
I would eat would be also sweet, even if it was salty or bitter, everything which I ate

455
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:44,830
-Left a sweet taste.
-Which was gone after 3 weeks.

456
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,350
On the emotional level from the Thuja I felt really horrible. I felt as if there is a kind of a

457
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:59,510
war between me and the world, as if I'm covered with something and there is isolation

458
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:08,590
feeling and I felt really not so good and also the energy was depleting as the time went by,

459
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:12,800
then I sent you a fax, you told me to take Mercury 50M, I took it and it went back to

460
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:14,690
the original condition.

461
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:20,440
Then I had this incident, which I told you before, in Israel with people saw me in the street

462
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:23,680
and told me how are you doing and all this and I decided I'm not going to be here

463
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:25,520
anymore as a live case.

464
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:33,200
Then I think it was last two seminars where you described Staphysagria.

465
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:42,340
And after you described Staphysagria, I felt so much fit into it, so I took it by myself a few times.

466
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:46,680
-What potencies did you take?

467
01:10:46,780 --> 01:10:56,100
-I took 200 and 1M and so I felt no difference at all. Then by advice of other homeopath

468
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:04,440
last year, one year ago exactly, I took Alumina 30C, daily dose for 10 days.

469
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:14,130
The reaction which happened from Alumina was a reaction that the constipation quite

470
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:22,140
immediately was gone and I got after a few days, a skin disease which later on I found out the name

471
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:25,830
of the disease was pityriasis rosea.

472
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:33,470
The whole body from the neck up to the elbow, up to the ankles, the whole body was

473
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:39,170
covered with skin rashes, which begun in the previous area and begun to go to the extremities.

474
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:47,140
So the whole body actually was covered with very severe skin rashes, which were not

475
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:51,490
itching, not oozing, just the skin was peeling off very dramatically.

476
01:11:52,980 --> 01:12:00,530
This disease continued for 6 weeks, then for 2 weeks gradually went down and then it went away.

477
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:14,060
Then after about half a year, the homeopath which gave me Alumina, advised me to take

478
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:21,230
Nat. mur. which is the first remedy, which I really felt change emotionally, from the

479
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:33,140
remedy. He gave me Nat. mur. 50M and really this is the first time that I can really tell you

480
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:37,310
that I feel difference from the action of the remedy emotionally.

481
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:43,830
I felt much movement inside and I felt that things have opened up and something good is happening.

482
01:12:48,080 --> 01:13:01,730
That time I was in India already, and I took Ignatia because I had an older condition

483
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:06,660
where the sighing was so severe and the pressure on the chest...

484
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:15,000
-Because of some grief or just out of the blue?
-No, because of some incident which happened.

485
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:20,150
And the breathing was so difficult, I actually had to stop and to concentrate on the chest

486
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:26,740
and to breathe slowly, so I can actually breath. I took Ignatia 200C, very good results.

487
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:34,500
Then after a week again I felt a grief, salt and thirst, I took Nat. mur. 1M.

488
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:38,660
Then after a week, after that again, sighing, can't breathe, Ignatia.

489
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:42,230
After a week again, thirsty, salty, grief, Nat. mur.

490
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:48,580
That went on for about 3 times to each remedy, Nat. mur, Ignatia, alternate.

491
01:13:49,330 --> 01:13:55,580
Then in the middle of July it finished. I felt that I'm stabilizing and I'm feeling well.

492
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:06,900
Then the last remedy which I've taken it happened about a month ago, I was still in India

493
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:12,060
that time and I got very severe stomach poisoning. I drunk some milk, some yogurt and

494
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:20,980
one hour after that I got 40 degrees. And I was burned in fire, with delusions

495
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,290
and delusional condition.

496
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:27,390
There was one delusion come, take Belladonna.

497
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:31,030
I take Belladonna, I had an aggravation where I actually almost died.

498
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:38,810
Then the day after, I thought to myself every movement is aggravating, take Bryonia

499
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:45,810
I take Bryonia, no effect. Third day I thought Mercury last time was helping, I took Mercury,

500
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:51,730
also I had very severe aggravation where all the lymphatic nodes on the body were swelling and

501
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:54,910
were very painful, without an amelioration.

502
01:14:56,110 --> 01:15:01,080
Then I took antibiotics because I was really in a bad shape, really in bad condition.

503
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:08,560
With 40 degrees and losing water, extreme diarrhea, extreme headache, the headache

504
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:12,080
was in such a degree where I could actually feel that the head would explode.

505
01:15:14,830 --> 01:15:21,820
I took antibiotics for a few days which of course helped and as the disease begun to reduce,

506
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:27,830
I begun to develop a kind of very severe flu, sneezing and running nose and coughing.

507
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:34,570
And I didn't want to take any other more of allopathic medication, so I took Nux vomica.

508
01:15:34,670 --> 01:15:36,480
That was the last one which I have taken.

509
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:37,730
-How long ago?

510
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:45,400
-About a month and a half ago, which helped for the symptoms of that flu which appeared

511
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:52,140
immediately after that condition but it did not help in the recovery of that acute condition

512
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:53,830
which I had before.

513
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:59,070
I mean the weakness, which I had, continued until a few days ago actually.

514
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:06,580
I still felt very sluggish, unbalanced and I felt not so good.

515
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:12,910
Only the last week I feel that I recovered fully.

516
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:25,190
After Nux vomica I felt that there is some disturbance of thinking, I feel heaviness in the head

517
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:34,600
and I can't think, I can't concentrate and right now it's still there.

518
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:41,050
I think it's coming from the Nux vomica, there is a kind of disturbance in concentration

519
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:42,780
and some heaviness in the head.

520
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:50,690
These are the remedies which I've taken so far; out of them I can tell you the only one

521
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:57,450
which I really feel it did something for me is the Nat. mur and Ignatia, as complementary.

522
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:00,790
All the rest I don't feel really did something.

523
01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:12,100
-But you have taken before Nat. mur. in the past, 5 years ago?

524
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:17,280
-No, I didn't take. In the past I took only 2 remedies, I took for some years Staphysagria

525
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:18,950
first and then Stramonium.

526
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:25,450
-Before coming here?
-Before coming here I took only two remedies.

527
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:36,350
-You don't remember well. I will tell you, it's very simple. When you came here, you came

528
01:17:36,450 --> 01:17:46,190
with 40 fever, a pneumonia, you were exhausted, you were in a terrible state and I gave

529
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:54,930
you Belladonna and after you go out of the acute, I gave you Calc. carb.

530
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:55,800
-That's right.

531
01:17:55,900 --> 01:17:58,450
-You forgot already to mention two major remedies.

532
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:10,040
-I hope you remember how you were when you came here after antibiotics.

533
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:18,450
At that time you had again antibiotics but your condition was really very severe.

534
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,180
-Very similar condition happened to India this time, very similar condition.

535
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:29,510
-And that's why also if you were a little bit patient and you kept on taking the Belladonna

536
01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:33,590
you would see with Belladonna you would finish.

537
01:18:33,690 --> 01:18:37,520
But you were too fast, changing the remedies.

538
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:44,590
Because the explosion, what you described, even little things you described, seems Belladonna was

539
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:54,190
again indicated. If you had waited a little bit more, you wouldn't have to take antibiotics but anyhow.

540
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:03,940
If I understood you well you say the last week, you are back in good condition.

541
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:07,140
-The last week I feel that I am normal.

542
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:17,920
Let me tell you right now the symptoms which are rising the last half a year, more

543
01:19:18,020 --> 01:19:26,170
prominently, more severe. First of all of course the same disease, which I' m here for

544
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:29,190
is the scar tissue, which is inflamed inside.

545
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:30,600
-The scar tissue where?

546
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:35,980
-In the inguinal left sides. I had a hernia operation.

547
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:41,100
-And still there is a pain? Cutting pain there?

548
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:50,350
-Tearing pain, cutting pain, knife like pain. Also there is discharge, once there is constipation

549
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:53,600
and there is the effort to pass stool, there is discharge.

550
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:55,970
-Discharge from the prostate?
-Yes.

551
01:19:56,070 --> 01:20:02,600
Now they examined twice the fluid of the prostate and they found out that in the prostate fluid there

552
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:06,200
is a bacteria which can be found only in the large intestine.

553
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:10,690
A bacteria which exists only in the large intestine.

554
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:16,710
Because of this they sent me to colonoscopy and they found nothing. The examination was fine.

555
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:24,370
-How do they call the bacteria?
-Staphylococcus type D.

556
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:39,930
Whenever there is indication of the scar over there, whenever there is bloatness of the abdomen

557
01:20:40,030 --> 01:20:45,770
or constipation or there is lots of urine which aggregates, when ever there is

558
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:51,450
stress in this local area, the scar tissue is extremely painful.

559
01:20:54,200 --> 01:21:03,770
I can actually feel that inside is like this. If you take two pieces of meat and you begin

560
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:09,120
to stretch, this is how it feels.

561
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:14,870
-That is called tearing pain and it is very painful.

562
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:23,520
-If there is bloated stomach from flatulence or there is constipation or aggregation of too

563
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:32,930
much urine, because of let's say I'm sitting in movies and I can't go for two hours...

564
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:35,620
-The pain starts?
-Yes.

565
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:44,360
-This is for always but symptoms which arise and become lately strongly more

566
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:48,850
this symptom begun many years ago and there is extreme pain on the left side of the

567
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:59,770
hip, the hip is extremely painful, very painful up to the level that most of the time

568
01:21:59,870 --> 01:22:02,060
I'm limping, I cant' go straight.

569
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:08,810
Another symptom which is happening the last two months, I have small warts over here

570
01:22:08,910 --> 01:22:17,470
in the thumb, over here in the left leg, some in the abdomen and even though I speak to

571
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:20,080
them, they still resist.

572
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:29,970
Other symptom which is very old symptom and lately the frequency of that symptom

573
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:34,810
begins to come more and more, is that I have once for a while a pain in the liver

574
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:39,610
where I feel as if there is a hard ball below the ribs.

575
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:45,560
And the pain in the liver, definitely in that disease, in that acute it was very painful in the

576
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,100
liver area and also was swollen.

577
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:58,310
The liver is more painful when I become generally exhausted.

578
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:04,140
If I'm pushing myself too hard, if I'm learning too much, if I'm pushing myself too much

579
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:12,990
to the extreme, the liver becomes somehow sensitive, I feel some discomfort.

580
01:23:14,910 --> 01:23:20,410
-Any headache?
-Not specifically.

581
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:29,910
Constipation tendency generally is still there, with a lot of flatusness.

582
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:36,330
-The flatusness comes with certain food?
-No.

583
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:29,980
-The dry eruptions that you had in your head originally, what happened with that?

584
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,920
-It didn't come back anymore.

585
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:42,390
-The constricting in your throat when speaking, you remember you mentioned?

586
01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:47,000
-Yes, I think that Nat. mur. changed a lot also in this respect.

587
01:24:50,250 --> 01:24:52,060
-What about salivation during night?

588
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:56,400
-This one is a symptom which is still there but much less and it comes and goes.

589
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:02,400
There is a period where it doesn't at all appear, especially when I'm becoming very weak

590
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:07,910
this is the time where you see saliva more, but if I'm generally OK, you won't see it.

591
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:10,910
-The aphthae?

592
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:19,400
-Again when the general condition is deteriorating, there will be some aphthae on the

593
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:26,990
gums, only on the gums and also the gums tend to inflame in general.

594
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:41,310
-Did you have this after this incident in India where your body went down very much?

595
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:43,000
-Yes.

596
01:25:43,490 --> 01:25:45,980
-How is your self-confidence?

597
01:25:51,500 --> 01:26:00,810
-Increasing gradually but still I feel that this is an area in myself which requires much

598
01:26:00,910 --> 01:26:04,910
more improvement.

599
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:08,730
-What about the offensive breath from the mouth?

600
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:17,420
-After the acute was very strong, extremely strong but now it's not so strong, it's OK.

601
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:22,980
-And the constipation is better you say, than it was originally.

602
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:28,150
-From the original condition is much better but the tendency is there and I need

603
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:31,650
somehow to be aware of diet.

604
01:26:31,750 --> 01:26:36,230
-The perspiration that was oily, is still oily?
-No.

605
01:26:37,670 --> 01:26:47,750
-The tears were oily you have said.
-Not anymore.

606
01:26:52,930 --> 01:27:00,510
-Also you have said a water sensation in the head, as if cold water was pouring...

607
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:04,190
-It also disappeared, I think that Thuja somehow took it away.

608
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:10,170
-And general amelioration in the evening, in the night?

609
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:17,520
-Yes, this still I feel it, when the evening comes, I feel more ease emotionally.

610
01:27:18,050 --> 01:27:22,590
-How you feel after the stool?

611
01:27:22,690 --> 01:27:34,010
-After stool I feel great, I feel that the sky is open, such a relief, the best time for me

612
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:37,610
to have new ideas, after stool.

613
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,780
The remedy is clear, what is the potency?

614
01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:18,520
I did not look.

615
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:43,930
The remedy is there. What is the remedy?

616
01:28:52,860 --> 01:29:03,190
Who says Nat. sulp.? Let me see the hands? 85% of the class, very good.

617
01:29:03,730 --> 01:29:11,190
The remedy is Nat. sulph. I made it a little bit easier for you with the last question.

618
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:12,630
-Yes.

619
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:36,600
-There is a kind of very deep inflammation, which is going on there for so many years.

620
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:38,350
-12 years.

621
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:46,490
-12 years he has this inflammation and stays there, that's why the different remedies that

622
01:29:46,590 --> 01:30:00,330
he has taken did not touch the case. But now is the time where most probably he will

623
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:06,090
have an effect on his prostate gland, which is there.

624
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:18,620
Show me why Nat. sulp. Show me the remedies.

625
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:34,370
You did not put the last.

626
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:52,720
Hip joint pain, liver, constipation, cheerful after stool.

627
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:13,970
So instead of Nat. mur. it's better Nat. sulp. What potency?

628
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:30,780
We start with 200 and repeat it accordingly, you wait, see what happens, if it's better

629
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:47,100
then you may have to repeat it several times to fight this kind of very persistent inflammation.

630
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,420
-Day by day?

631
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:53,690
-No, if you need it after 3 days, there is an amelioration after 3 days and you feel back the

632
01:31:53,790 --> 01:32:05,680
pain, repeat it. But I would suggest also like the other case that you take 6X the salt, take

633
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:07,770
it 3 times the day, every day.

634
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:11,690
-OK.
-3-4 times the day you can take tissue salt.
