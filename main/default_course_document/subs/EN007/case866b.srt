1
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:28,464
This is a case we saw last year. It’s a case of a boy with autism and asthma.

2
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:34,864
He got as a prescription Hyoscyamus 200C

3
00:00:35,905 --> 00:00:44,099
and the symptoms that have been ameliorated where asthma 30%,

4
00:00:45,104 --> 00:00:55,340
eye contact and verbal communication improved, social interaction improved,

5
00:00:55,586 --> 00:01:07,565
hyperactivity lessened, bowel motion in pants, disappeared, facial expression lessened.

6
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:14,693
What do you mean “facial expression lessened”?
- Grimaces.

7
00:01:15,183 --> 00:01:27,226
– He was making a lot of grimaces. Anxiety lessened, handles crowds better,

8
00:01:27,983 --> 00:01:33,893
movies scripting lessened. What is “movies scripting lessened”?

9
00:01:34,144 --> 00:01:39,185
– He was repeating from the movies, movie talk.

10
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:48,186
Now it’s less but sometimes now he uses a portion of it and uses it appropriately,

11
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:52,301
he uses expression from the movie because he learns the language like that I guess.

12
00:01:53,822 --> 00:02:03,418
– You remark here that 2 months after going back his eye contact

13
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:12,888
and communication improved so much that everyone at school, September 2012,

14
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:20,058
commented this change. So at school they also realized that. The boy was better.

15
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:25,424
Symptoms that have been remaining or got worse after the remedies;

16
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:31,824
sensitivity to reprimand improved just a bit,

17
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:36,944
however he is still very sensitive to any request

18
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:44,624
that are not presented to him in a very gentle manner or with a sense of humor.

19
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:52,058
If you say “do this”...?
– No, you have to be cuddly, how about doing this.

20
00:02:52,568 --> 00:02:58,704
– During the affection you say why don’t you do that.

21
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:02,298
– And then actually he wants to do it by himself. You don’t have to order.

22
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:06,138
– He does not want to take orders?
– No.

23
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:12,266
– You explain that as not wanting authorities. Is that correct?

24
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:29,178
–Yes this is something at school, they have an educational assistant who helps with him

25
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:36,586
and sometimes when the woman doesn’t come to school, it’s always one woman,

26
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:48,783
the same one, if somebody else is ordering, everyone knows he refuses to cooperate.

27
00:03:49,024 --> 00:04:01,824
If you are nice and firm but gentle then he corresponds and they know that.

28
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:09,504
– “Request that are not presented to him in a very gentle manner”...

29
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:17,184
Comprehension improved but still poor. You mean in the school

30
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:25,903
or when he is reading or looking at...?
– General. When he is looking, he knows,

31
00:04:26,144 --> 00:04:34,863
but verbal comprehension. But in school and at home it is still the connection

32
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:39,703
between what you are telling him is not there.

33
00:04:39,983 --> 00:04:48,943
Visually, pictures and if you explain him his is amazing, he gets it, he is a very smart boy.

34
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:59,693
– “Facial expression lessened but still present in the form of game with parents.

35
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:13,263
Anxiety lessened but still present.” How do you realize his anxiety? What are the signs?

36
00:05:13,504 --> 00:05:21,410
– When we go to a friend’s house we prepare him, we use to show a picture

37
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:28,062
and then he would come to the house right away, he needs a preparation himself,

38
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:31,982
he needs to be outside, to get ready to meet people.

39
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:40,422
Now, in Serbia we were going to 3 houses every day minimum, family and friends

40
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:46,582
and meeting lots of people and he was ok with that. So much better.

41
00:05:46,822 --> 00:05:50,422
So that’s one of the things.
– He remembered me?

42
00:05:50,662 --> 00:06:00,386
– I think so. Do you remember mr. Vithoulkas? Well he told me before that he did.

43
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:06,022
We showed him a picture so he said he did. I think so.

44
00:06:06,295 --> 00:06:10,382
He definitely remembers the camera.

45
00:06:10,626 --> 00:06:17,222
– Asthma improved but asthmatic attacks still happened with humid weather.

46
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:25,942
Can you tell me if there are certain hours in the night that he gets dyspnea?

47
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:32,855
– Usually before the bed he gets worse, always like that.

48
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:44,055
Around 10 p.m. it starts worsening and then the peak would be at 5 in the morning.

49
00:06:44,302 --> 00:06:50,182
– Between 4 and 5 a.m. or at 5 a.m.?

50
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:57,102
– I can’t tell you that because when it gets extreme then it is more often

51
00:06:57,346 --> 00:07:06,582
and there is no time.
– But this 5 a.m. you said it, you know it,

52
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:12,898
you didn’t say it just like that.
– Yes between 4 and 5 a.m.

53
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:16,982
– There is an aggravation.
– Yes.

54
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:22,862
– Does he have breakfast?
– Yes.

55
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:33,890
– After breakfast have you noticed having diarrhea?
– No, not after breakfast.

56
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:38,622
– But you have definitely noticed humid weather?

57
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:49,102
– That’s definitely the trigger. It always was. Even two years ago when we came to see you.

58
00:07:49,378 --> 00:07:53,730
– “Symptoms that may have been ameliorated and got worse again;

59
00:07:53,982 --> 00:07:58,062
asthma better for 6 months after the first remedy,

60
00:07:59,618 --> 00:08:10,370
after these initial 6 months it was fluctuating for the following 15 months.

61
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:21,378
With new diet introduced in February asthma suddenly disappeared”. What diet?

62
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:28,022
– There is a special that we introduced because of him.

63
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:39,810
– Without gluten?
– No, no carbohydrates, no sugar, no milk.

64
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:44,610
He didn’t drink milk so this was not affecting him cause he was allergic,

65
00:08:45,102 --> 00:08:54,582
sugar he never wanted to eat.
– How does he know there is sugar?

66
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,382
– I don’t know. There was one time when he was touching and a little bit licking it

67
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:08,098
but that was it, I asked him to try a cookie and he tried it and he didn’t like it.

68
00:09:08,342 --> 00:09:15,010
– He does not like sweets.
– No. I was very similar when I was young.

69
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:21,144
– I wasn’t obviously. (09:01)

70
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:33,902
- Is he in his play doing dangerous things? Walking on something dangerous,

71
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:44,142
on a high place where he can fall...?
– No. He always was a cautious boy.

72
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:54,382
– Is he afraid in the night staying alone? Afraid of the dark?
– No. Never was.

73
00:09:55,415 --> 00:10:02,142
– Is there any urination during sleep?
– Yes, sometimes. Not all the time.

74
00:10:13,302 --> 00:10:25,858
– You say that he had some asthmatic attacks on June 15, 29.

75
00:10:26,128 --> 00:10:36,542
– Just when we went to Serbia before we came here.
– Was the weather humid?

76
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:47,298
– Extremely. And it’s not only asthma. First, he had wheezing and rattling, so that’s there.

77
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:53,942
When it is very humid then his stomach starts going inside

78
00:10:54,210 --> 00:11:00,610
because he is struggling to push the oxygen and it was very scary

79
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:07,778
so we gave him the puffer, Ventolin, and at one point it wasn’t even working.

80
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:16,738
– The weather was according to your understanding humid

81
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:22,370
or did the weather forecast say that the weather is humid?

82
00:11:22,622 --> 00:11:32,866
– No, it was raining every day and it was very humid, even visible, it was foggy.

83
00:11:35,182 --> 00:11:45,422
– Generally you say he is much calmer, expresses more initiative in verbal communication.

84
00:11:45,942 --> 00:11:51,302
Now can he verbalize everything?
– No.

85
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:57,462
– He can verbalize a few words.
– Not words. He can talk but...

86
00:11:58,222 --> 00:12:06,535
- He can make a phrase?
– Yes. He asks for things, now he is very shy

87
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:10,602
because there are many new people obviously but if he spends some time with you

88
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:16,386
he will be different. So he can say what he wants, where he wants to go, what he likes...

89
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:23,542
abstract ideas.
– The fact he sits quietly here is because he is afraid

90
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,662
or because he understands he has to sit?

91
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:35,582
– Maybe he is a little bit anxious, I don’t think he is afraid. He knows that he has to sit.

92
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:42,498
I think he understands what we are talking about.

93
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:49,175
That’s why we are going to say that he is amazing. He is doing great now.

94
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:57,622
Talking so well and in school doing so well. We are very proud of him.

95
00:12:57,622 --> 00:12:59,906
– Is he angry sometimes?

96
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:10,530
– Actually, when we came from Serbia he became a little bit more at me

97
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:21,022
but I have to say something about Serbia. When we went to Serbia first time with him

98
00:13:21,262 --> 00:13:28,702
he was almost 2 years old and after that thing started we was developing ok

99
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:32,022
and then he regressed from 2 to 3.

100
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:40,462
So, at that time, at 18 months he stopped breastfeeding, he got MMR vaccine,

101
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:46,862
he got first ear infection treated with antibiotics then we came to Serbia,

102
00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:52,770
grandmother passed away and he was there. She passed away in the hospital

103
00:13:52,862 --> 00:13:59,782
but he was there until that day. So he was playing with her in the bed

104
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,140
and then that day when she went to the hospital he was crying

105
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:07,262
so he knew she was going to pass away.

106
00:14:07,622 --> 00:14:14,295
Now it was the first time we went back over there, 8 years later,

107
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:22,262
I just wanted to mention that. And then the weather was very humid.

108
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:32,342
– His adaptability improved?
– Yes.

109
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:36,942
– He has more friends now?
– Yes.

110
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:48,982
– More independent and adjusted at school as seen by more teachers at school,

111
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:56,770
he is gentle, compassionate, smart boy with great sense of humor.

112
00:14:57,262 --> 00:15:03,382
If you are not feeling well or his father he will be affected?

113
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:10,022
– Oh, yes, he would come and try to console or anybody else, ok, not the first time

114
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:17,186
but he would come and try to console. Especially if somebody is crying.

115
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:31,542
– There is any particular desire that he wants to eat, eggs, salami, meat, fish...

116
00:15:32,055 --> 00:15:37,422
- That’s hard now to say because of his diet. He is restricted to certain things.

117
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,782
– Does he ask? Says why don’t you give me this?

118
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:50,018
– He was only asking for bananas, but I don’t think that’s a correct thing

119
00:15:50,262 --> 00:15:54,102
because the other things he knows he cannot touch he doesn’t.

120
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,742
He loves the frozen juice, before we make the ice cream.

121
00:15:59,982 --> 00:16:10,782
Frozen ice cream, frozen juice. That’s something he asked me the other day

122
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:14,380
and I made it with banana and he didn’t like it.

123
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:23,582
– Do you know if he grinds his teeth in sleep?

124
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:30,502
– Right now not, in Canada he used to, it was off and on,

125
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:34,860
I could hear him grind the teeth and tossing...

126
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:39,980
- Not anymore?
– Not now. Not lately. And in Greece now,

127
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:45,182
his breathing is much better, he is sleeping well.

128
00:16:52,012 --> 00:17:02,146
- Is he thirsty?
– Not much. He used to drink juice a lot,

129
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:10,103
like orange juice, 2 liters a day, but we took it out because of the diet, he drinks water,

130
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,892
he used not to drink water at all, but now he drinks, but not too much.

131
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:22,962
– The water has to be cold? Very cold?
– No, normal.

132
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:39,735
I want to mention something about the sleep. He has a new bedroom as from last May.

133
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:47,662
– He has brother or sister?
– No. So he started sleeping in this new bedroom

134
00:17:47,906 --> 00:17:52,782
and then he had at one point attack, in December and then he came back

135
00:17:53,026 --> 00:17:56,622
and he is sleeping with us. So maybe that’s important.

136
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:01,495
He still doesn’t want to go back to his bedroom.

137
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:12,866
– He did not have a room for himself before?
– He had, but he never wanted to sleep.

138
00:18:13,142 --> 00:18:19,022
So we made a new room.
– But still he does not want to go to the new room.

139
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:25,982
– He was sleeping by himself for 6 months and then he had attack during the night.

140
00:18:26,084 --> 00:18:31,895
– He was not able to breathe, he got scared and came back.

141
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:40,342
– About the sleep, the new thing, that’s something he didn’t do before,

142
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:48,263
he sleeps on his back and sometimes with his hands up. Not all the time, but on his back.

143
00:18:48,535 --> 00:18:52,102
He used to be different before.

144
00:18:56,982 --> 00:19:07,462
When he is in a big distress with breathing recently with the asthma in Serbia,

145
00:19:08,102 --> 00:19:18,342
he is all sweaty, a lot. Drenched in water.

146
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:23,735
But only when he has these extreme problems with breathing.

147
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:31,415
Usually he doesn’t sweat at night.

148
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:40,226
– You have to add something?
– Yes. He likes to be made laugh,

149
00:19:40,502 --> 00:19:44,342
all the time when we are together we have to make faces and he laughs.

150
00:19:44,855 --> 00:19:55,942
He loves to do that, to play with laughing. He likes funny things.

151
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,303
– Is he serious now?
– He is very serious.

152
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:16,663
– This is not time for playing. He is bored also.
– No. We also noticed that in Serbia

153
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:25,132
and here he seemed to be better when he is outside. That’s just recent. Breathingwise.

154
00:20:25,623 --> 00:20:31,020
When he is outside and everything open, even though it was humid.

155
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:39,980
That wasn’t in Canada before. The last 3 weeks maybe, that’s the new thing.

156
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:49,182
– Is he crying easily?
– Yes, well it depends.

157
00:20:49,702 --> 00:20:57,382
If he hurts himself physically, he is not crying, he doesn’t show physical pain.

158
00:20:59,422 --> 00:21:04,382
Recently he had this pain in his leg, in the muscle...

159
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:16,182
- During sleep was this pain?</br>– No, he woke up and started telling me.

160
00:21:16,422 --> 00:21:21,026
But that was the first time he was crying for such a thing, usually he hits something.

161
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:28,982
But if you reprimand, if you tell him something, or I, or my husband raises a little bit

162
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:38,946
his voice, or just say “stop it! I am serious”, he cries. So he is very easily hurt this way.

163
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:42,078
– Perspiration during asthma.

164
00:21:43,662 --> 00:21:48,422
– I have to confess something, I didn’t do anything wrong but it seems like...

165
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:56,102
We went to the dentist, one tooth was coming out and the old tooth is still there.

166
00:21:56,622 --> 00:21:59,942
– You took it out?
– No. It’s still there.

167
00:22:00,215 --> 00:22:05,335
So we went to the dentist, November 20th to see that,

168
00:22:05,582 --> 00:22:11,222
just to monitor what we are going to do and I was entertaining him,

169
00:22:11,462 --> 00:22:17,622
because he was so scared, the dentist put something

170
00:22:17,862 --> 00:22:23,255
and he said what is that and said it was fluoride. I didn’t want to do that...

171
00:22:23,502 --> 00:22:30,146
- Why he did that? To disinfect or what?
– God only knows.

172
00:22:30,422 --> 00:22:41,175
– He told me for the gingivitis. But this is something he didn’t even tell me,

173
00:22:41,422 --> 00:22:44,742
he didn’t ask me, he just did it. And I was furious

174
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:48,582
because his toothpaste doesn’t have fluoride.

175
00:22:48,855 --> 00:23:08,418
– But otherwise he didn’t have any dental treatment. He is allergic to milk.

176
00:23:09,698 --> 00:23:14,818
– But not only to milk.
– No. He had lots of allergies.

177
00:23:15,822 --> 00:23:24,542
– The asthmatic attacks are usually in the night time or also on daytime?

178
00:23:24,782 --> 00:23:31,970
– Also on daytime. But usually during the night he gets worse.

179
00:23:32,222 --> 00:23:38,862
Whatever it was during the day, it gets much worse during the night.

180
00:23:42,982 --> 00:23:47,782
He is also scared of animals but less now.

181
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:57,782
Dogs and cats terrify him but now it’s better but still there.

182
00:24:02,135 --> 00:24:09,902
– If the animal is big like a cow, would he be afraid of that or you do not know?

183
00:24:10,178 --> 00:24:15,298
– I think in Serbia he tried a little bit with the sheep,

184
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:19,650
so when he noticed that they were scared of him he liked that.

185
00:24:19,902 --> 00:24:25,782
So he was chasing them a little bit. But keeping always distance.

186
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:37,058
He was playing with the sheep quite a bit. And as a baby he wasn’t afraid until 2.

187
00:24:37,302 --> 00:24:39,895
He was feeding, we had a dog, a big black Labrador,

188
00:24:40,142 --> 00:24:43,735
he was feeding him and everything was ok.

189
00:24:47,575 --> 00:25:00,102
– What was the reason, was it the vaccination that preceded this situation?

190
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:12,022
– At that time also it was antibiotics. And that’s the only time in his life he had.

191
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:17,902
He had in November antibiotics and he was turning 2 in January next year.

192
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:23,782
And then on February he had 2 courses of antibiotics and that’s it for the whole time.

193
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:29,666
That was the timing also, 18 months I stopped breastfeeding

194
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:37,495
and then he also had MMR vaccine and then these antibiotics in between.

195
00:25:37,986 --> 00:25:47,702
– The vaccine he had it how many months before you realized something is wrong?

196
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:56,862
– He had maybe 6 months or more, because it started after 2

197
00:25:57,378 --> 00:26:01,342
and maybe 2 and a half we were sure something was wrong.

198
00:26:01,582 --> 00:26:06,462
– MMR was in the vaccination?
– Yes.

199
00:26:06,702 --> 00:26:13,378
– When was the vaccination?
– I think around 18 months.

200
00:26:13,622 --> 00:26:17,730
We delayed it actually for 6 months to get it when he was 12 months

201
00:26:17,982 --> 00:26:21,102
and he received it when he was 18.
– Why they delayed it?

202
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:25,942
– No, we did. We delayed all the vaccines. We didn’t want to vaccinate him.

203
00:26:26,182 --> 00:26:32,582
– After that we actually stopped.
– You tried to delay and then you finally...

204
00:26:32,682 --> 00:26:37,562
– I asked the doctor to give us 3 separate ones, not a combination.

205
00:26:37,702 --> 00:26:41,542
We would pay, he said it doesn’t exist. I said without Immersol,

206
00:26:42,062 --> 00:26:48,215
which is the mercury catalyst and he said we don’t produce it

207
00:26:48,462 --> 00:26:52,982
and I said you don’t produce it now but you produced it a year ago.

208
00:26:54,862 --> 00:27:01,655
But at the bottom line I could have said “change the doctor” but I didn’t change.

209
00:27:02,146 --> 00:27:20,342
– You had information or an intuition?
– Both. We never believed in vaccines.

210
00:27:21,102 --> 00:27:29,542
We also knew it was not the law but we couldn’t find out from the paper which form...

211
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:33,142
- It’s very hard to find a way to get exempted from the vaccines.

212
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:39,266
When he was around 3 we found Helen and he was officially exempted,

213
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:42,102
he didn’t receive any vaccine after that.

214
00:27:42,342 --> 00:27:47,235
- But before that people would say there is a paper or form but nobody knew what.

215
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:50,086
– Nobody wanted to tell us essentially.

216
00:27:50,162 --> 00:27:51,842
– I don’t know about that.

217
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:58,942
But we were raised in Serbia so we didn’t know that.
– Ok.

218
00:28:04,823 --> 00:28:17,900
I think it is a lucky boy after his bad luck of being affected by the vaccination.

219
00:28:18,903 --> 00:28:27,342
As I have said, as a general rule, which I have observed over the years,

220
00:28:29,662 --> 00:28:37,742
autistic children who have started their problems after vaccination,

221
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:50,050
are much easier to cure than if they were born straight away with this syndrome.

222
00:28:51,062 --> 00:29:01,302
So, in this boy for me it’s obvious because they say the boy was already speaking,

223
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:07,458
already behaving properly and suddenly he lost everything.

224
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:14,370
It was obvious that was the triple vaccination that had an effect.

225
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:20,258
Many times the effect does not immediately come,

226
00:29:20,502 --> 00:29:28,942
it may come after a few months but the effect was terrible.

227
00:29:30,742 --> 00:29:34,850
Fortunately we could see the first remedy

228
00:29:35,102 --> 00:29:42,530
and now I believe his second remedy is also clear

229
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:52,898
for those that they know some Materia Medica of Homeopathy.

230
00:29:53,662 --> 00:30:05,182
Who thinks he knows the remedy? That should be given now to the child?

231
00:30:05,698 --> 00:30:20,782
One, two, three, four, five, six? Only six, seven, eight, nine.

232
00:30:22,062 --> 00:30:29,502
I thought it would be more but it’s a new class.

233
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:44,182
Unfortunately the cases which come here, are, as you understand, the worst.

234
00:30:44,695 --> 00:30:49,026
The most difficult. Because they have tried everything

235
00:30:50,498 --> 00:30:52,375
and when they come here they are very difficult.

236
00:30:52,622 --> 00:31:09,292
Otherwise a homeopath would have recognized quite easily. So it is difficult but...

237
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:30,022
What is the most impressive in the character of this child?

238
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:52,300
– Affection.
– But he wants affection or he gives affection? Both.

239
00:31:53,822 --> 00:32:06,018
But what is also impressive is that when I asked whether the child is affected

240
00:32:06,262 --> 00:32:15,962
if somebody is not feeling well and the child goes there and tries to console,

241
00:32:16,622 --> 00:32:23,642
this shows a very affectionate child and sympathetic.

242
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:29,862
That means the person is suffering, that is what we call sympathetic.

243
00:32:29,962 --> 00:32:36,362
Is not a simple sympathy, it is passionate sympathy,

244
00:32:36,503 --> 00:32:52,098
that means I am suffering seeing others suffer. This is established there is no question.

245
00:32:52,342 --> 00:33:08,982
What other characteristic comes from his character? He rejects authority.

246
00:33:09,502 --> 00:33:15,382
If somebody is authoritative, tells him what to do he will not do it.

247
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:28,258
He just closes up and will not do it. He is a person against authority.

248
00:33:29,538 --> 00:33:41,058
It’s a person who suffers a lot in humidity. In humid weather.

249
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:48,738
So until now you have been thinking of a remedy

250
00:33:48,982 --> 00:33:56,662
which is very much sympathetic towards others, who is affectionate,

251
00:33:57,182 --> 00:34:13,302
who is not accepting authority but at the same time he is affected physically by humidity.

252
00:34:13,822 --> 00:34:27,902
And here we have the problem. Why do we have a problem? Michael?

253
00:34:31,222 --> 00:34:35,822
– Because many times Causticum is better when it’s raining.

254
00:34:36,098 --> 00:34:40,702
– Better in humid weather. We have been talking about

255
00:34:40,942 --> 00:34:50,942
the characteristic of his character lead us to the idea of Causticum.

256
00:34:51,182 --> 00:34:58,982
The remedy is Causticum. But Causticum is usually better in humid weather.

257
00:34:59,082 --> 00:35:01,506
This child is worse in humid weather.

258
00:35:01,782 --> 00:35:17,902
Not only that but the child is having the peak of the crisis in asthma around 5 a.m.

259
00:35:18,422 --> 00:35:20,902
Now which is the remedy that has it?

260
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:36,262
Show me the remedy that has peak of asthma at 5 a.m. 4 to 5 a.m.

261
00:35:47,266 --> 00:35:52,902
Natrum sulphuricum has this time of aggravation.

262
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:57,186
If you have a case of asthma where the person says

263
00:35:57,462 --> 00:36:03,342
I wake up every night between 4 and 5 a.m. and I have my crisis that time

264
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:09,622
then Natrum sulphuricum is almost specific remedy for that.

265
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:14,742
You need one more point to confirm Natrum sulphuricum.

266
00:36:14,982 --> 00:36:24,215
And this is that Natrum sulphuricum is worse in humid weather.

267
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:30,862
They are extremely sensitive to humid weather.

268
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:35,462
So that is why I was continuing to inquire,

269
00:36:35,982 --> 00:36:41,862
because we have 2 remedies contradicting each other

270
00:36:42,382 --> 00:36:50,860
and which one will be the uppermost at this moment to give

271
00:36:51,102 --> 00:37:05,702
and follow with the other one etc.? So the decision is going to be difficult.

272
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:15,692
I was wondering whether anybody could tell me... Show me Causticum.

273
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:23,292
Is very sympathetic, you see repertory, it is in the third degree.

274
00:37:24,652 --> 00:37:35,747
Mind anarchist, they don’t like authorities, sweets aversion.

275
00:37:36,022 --> 00:37:42,935
It is a characteristic of Causticum. And this is impressive.

276
00:37:43,182 --> 00:37:47,782
When a child has aversion to sweets then it is certainly aversion to sweets.

277
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:58,022
Usually children like sweets. He doesn’t like sweets. The fear of animals also.

278
00:37:58,786 --> 00:38:03,415
Show me fear of animals.

279
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:15,182
Belladonna, Calcarea, China, Causticum is on the second degree. Show me fear of dogs!

280
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:25,175
You see Causticum is one of the 5 remedies. You see why you have the problem,

281
00:38:25,422 --> 00:38:31,426
because you have 2 strong keynotes of a remedy for his asthma

282
00:38:31,702 --> 00:38:42,455
and you have five keynotes for his mental emotional picture.

283
00:38:43,462 --> 00:39:04,730
What should the decision be and for what reason you should decide this or that?

284
00:39:11,623 --> 00:39:18,023
Maybe I am asking a difficult question but I will explain to you.

285
00:39:22,135 --> 00:39:33,383
The cure of anybody should start from the mental emotional

286
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:38,264
and go towards the physical body,

287
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:44,582
so at this case we have symptoms from mental emotional sphere,

288
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:52,262
which are quite strong and symptoms from the physical body

289
00:39:52,505 --> 00:39:58,905
which contradict the remedy that is needed for the mental emotional symptoms.

290
00:39:59,172 --> 00:40:03,063
But if you give a remedy on the mental emotional

291
00:40:03,582 --> 00:40:06,342
and the mental emotional becomes better

292
00:40:06,585 --> 00:40:12,025
then the physical symptoms most probably will become worse.

293
00:40:12,292 --> 00:40:20,462
If we decide to give Causticum, mentally and emotionally the child will be thinking better.

294
00:40:20,742 --> 00:40:29,183
What we are interested here in, is not the asthma, it’s to build up again his brain.

295
00:40:29,702 --> 00:40:37,892
This is the main target. The brain has been destroyed. Asthma is secondary.

296
00:40:38,143 --> 00:40:48,383
Therefore if we have such a decision to make, the decision should be to give the remedy

297
00:40:48,622 --> 00:40:55,545
that could affect the mental emotional picture and make the physical body worse maybe.

298
00:40:55,812 --> 00:41:03,982
We have to go according to this rule and not the opposite.

299
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:11,534
Because if at this moment, you have to be very careful to what I say now,

300
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:19,214
we prefer to give the Natrum sulphuricum, the asthma will be better

301
00:41:19,463 --> 00:41:24,625
but the mental emotional state will be worse. And it will come back

302
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:30,502
and they say the child is regressing, he cannot think again

303
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:37,425
and his starts having these symptoms... The asthma would disappear.

304
00:41:37,689 --> 00:41:44,382
This is a rule that you have to think and it’s very clear in this case,

305
00:41:44,482 --> 00:41:53,346
which means that if we give Causticum at this moment then the asthma will get worse

306
00:41:53,585 --> 00:42:02,820
and most probably, at a certain point where his asthma will be much worse

307
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:11,266
and the asthma will manifest with great force between 4 and 5 a.m.

308
00:42:11,505 --> 00:42:23,025
then Natrum sulphuricum will do the work. But the asthma will be worse at first

309
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:35,906
and that is when we say we have to choose the remedy according to a certain series.

310
00:42:36,145 --> 00:42:41,026
You cannot give the third remedy underneath,

311
00:42:41,265 --> 00:42:45,658
give it first because it will be pushing underneath symptoms

312
00:42:45,904 --> 00:43:01,782
and confusing the uppermost layer. The problem with Homeopathy so far is exactly this,

313
00:43:02,298 --> 00:43:08,426
because it’s so easy for one who hears and knows a little bit of Materia Medica,

314
00:43:08,698 --> 00:43:13,546
who hears that the child has an aggravation between 4 and 5 a.m. asthma,

315
00:43:13,818 --> 00:43:20,464
Natrum sulphuricum, and humid weather worse, Natrum sulphuricum immediately.

316
00:43:20,982 --> 00:43:28,408
And that is wrong. That you will pay. Because they will come back

317
00:43:28,662 --> 00:43:38,302
and they will say the child is not so good. When the child on a wrong prescription,

318
00:43:38,402 --> 00:43:45,094
do you think it will go back to Causticum or to have Hyoscyamus?

319
00:43:45,584 --> 00:43:49,942
Let’s say you gave the wrong prescription, Natrum sulphuricum,

320
00:43:50,214 --> 00:44:00,182
the child starts regressing. Which remedy you are going to give?

321
00:44:00,454 --> 00:44:08,899
You don’t know anymore because it may go right back to beginning,

322
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:14,785
to Hyoscyamus and instead of Hyoscyamus, because you thought of Causticum,

323
00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:29,022
you give Causticum, another mistake. The series is Hyoscyamus, Causticum

324
00:44:29,094 --> 00:44:33,742
and most probably the third remedy Natrum sulphuricum

325
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:44,229
where the boy will be in a quite good state,

326
00:44:44,505 --> 00:44:50,629
maybe this boy can follow eventually a technical school,

327
00:44:51,144 --> 00:45:03,705
can learn some simple technical things, he can be self – supporting,

328
00:45:03,944 --> 00:45:22,629
but if you leave him like that, God knows how he will end up. Is it clear?

329
00:45:27,065 --> 00:45:31,943
It’s a good teaching case by chance.

330
00:45:32,184 --> 00:45:36,024
Because some of you who know quite good Homeopathy,

331
00:45:36,304 --> 00:45:41,665
you will be thinking is it Natrum sulphuricum or is it Causticum.

332
00:45:41,665 --> 00:45:48,290
You have been thinking of that strongly.

333
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:14,584
– If he will be having an asthmatic crisis, if he makes some aggravation, what shall we do?

334
00:46:15,102 --> 00:46:19,971
– Give Natrum sulphuricum?
– No.

335
00:46:20,222 --> 00:46:28,146
– No, I will tell you something about this because it’s a good thing she said that.

336
00:46:28,421 --> 00:46:37,891
We were thinking of Natrum sulphuricum for the crisis but there is another remedy

337
00:46:38,386 --> 00:46:56,062
that is most probably indicated or will be indicated when the asthma is full blown

338
00:46:56,306 --> 00:47:13,704
and the other remedy is Sambucus nigra.

339
00:47:13,945 --> 00:47:23,180
This is a remedy that has excessive perspiration during asthmatic crisis.

340
00:47:27,665 --> 00:47:32,265
That is a keynote but with this keynote alone you may not do the job,

341
00:47:32,506 --> 00:47:39,823
while Natrum sulphuricum has 2 keynotes; worse humidity and worse 4 to 5 a.m.

342
00:47:40,827 --> 00:47:51,862
But if the asthmatic crisis changes from 4 to 5 a.m. to a constant crisis

343
00:47:52,134 --> 00:47:57,798
in the night of asthma and perspiration you may give Sambucus nigra.
