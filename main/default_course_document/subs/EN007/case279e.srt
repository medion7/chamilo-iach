1
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,420
-How are you feeling now?

2
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:38,060
-I think emotionally I'm more strong and centered, I feel better and mentally also a little bit,

3
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,220
still I have long way to go.

4
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,400
-Yes? I don't think so.

5
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,480
-With the memory but I think the confusion is better.

6
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,600
-Much better I would say, you are afraid to say much better.

7
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:02,350
-I think it's better but I still have from time to time, especially after eating

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:19,040
and under stress I don't remember what to say, like now. And energy I also think it's better.

9
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,520
-But can you give me an idea? It's better it doesn't say anything. How much better?

10
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:35,880
-Last time I told you I had a new job and I had not been working for many years,

11
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:42,560
I did not had the energy and also the sleep made it very difficult for me to work.

12
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:53,660
I'd been able to keep up this work and also work a little bit more but the sleep problem

13
00:01:53,760 --> 00:02:03,410
is still there but after the Causticum I have been able to tolerate a little bit better

14
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:10,830
the lack of sleep. I don't go to pieces as before and start crying when I'm too tired.

15
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,760
Now I'm able to go on still with less sleep.

16
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,170
-What potency did you take?
-200 Causticum.

17
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,020
-When?
-In the end of February I think.

18
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,080
-And it was during an acute that you took it?
-Yes.

19
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:50,530
-You said, Eupatorium perfoliatum, Causticum and Arsenicum, all the 3 remedies?

20
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:57,680
-No, Arsenicum you gave me before while I was here.

21
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:06,420
-Then you had an acute, when?
-In the beginning of February.

22
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,420
-And then you took Causticum and then you had another one, you took Eupatorium?

23
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:20,500
-No, I told you last time when I was supposed to start this work I got this acute

24
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:29,580
and I wanted to work and I could not be there the first day, so I tried the Eupatorium first,

25
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,830
it was the same acute.

26
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,810
-Yes, you said the same thing in the previous interview.

27
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:49,140
-Yes but still I'm much better in the evening and if I'm not working and if I have the opportunity

28
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:58,580
I like to sleep late and go to bed late and sleep along in the morning.

29
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:08,480
-How late you would like to go?
-It can be 5-6 o'clock in the morning.

30
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,420
-That's a good time.
-Almost all my life I've done this.

31
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:28,640
-But now actually what time are you going to bed? 12 o'clock? In Norway.

32
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:34,480
-In Norway when I have to go to work I try to go to bed not later than 2-3 but

33
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:41,660
sometimes I go a little bit earlier but I have to be really exhausted to go to bed.

34
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:52,070
And I have this kind of fear of bed still, so when I'm tired I can not sleep, it's not enough.

35
00:04:52,170 --> 00:05:00,080
I have to wait until I'm completely exhausted and if I sleep good one night,

36
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,000
the other night I can not sleep.

37
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,650
-And you sleep in your abdomen mostly?

38
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:16,420
-Not really, I like to sleep in my abdomen but my neck is so stiff, I can not tolerate this position.

39
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:26,080
-It's the position that you like.
-Yes, I lie on the side so much that is almost.

40
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,760
-I'd like to have some questions when you finish with your report.

41
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:47,810
-The sleep is also very restless because I feel I can not completely relax and restless

42
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:58,420
in my body, I have to get up and urinate and wake of the least noise, sound.

43
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,310
-How many times you need to go to urinate?

44
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:10,250
-I think that's improved, it's better but I still have to go 3-4 times and sometimes more.

45
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:24,840
It used to be 10 times every night, so it's better. This acute hearing makes me wake up a lot.

46
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:43,820
And it's also other things that make me no sleep, it's difficult to find the right temperature.

47
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,870
I take the window open and then I close it, it's too cold and more blankets

48
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:55,980
and the electricity on and then I don't tolerate the electricity and take it off again

49
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,930
and so I go back and forth.

50
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,820
-Do you feel cold?

51
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,330
-Yes, even now I wear socks.

52
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,840
So no remedy has really touched the coldness.

53
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,080
I'm still very cold and now with the change of temperature I was so cold, my whole spine

54
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,100
and back get stiff.

55
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,840
-In the past have you received Silica?
-No.

56
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:37,580
-You still have diarrhea or this is gone?

57
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,920
-I was better for a while but now I change my diet again.

58
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:50,250
I told you last time I had desire for bread and butter and it is and I've been eating that

59
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,270
and I have more diarrhea and I lose stool.

60
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:01,010
-Real diarrhea or soft?
-Both, it can change.

61
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:13,510
-How many times is diarrhea out of the week? An average.

62
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:20,210
-It depends on what I eat or if I'm excited but it's better, I used to have much more.

63
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,540
-The butter desire is still there strong?

64
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:35,450
-Yes, but the fat I don't tolerate very much, I get like a stone in the stomach

65
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:41,030
and get very heavy and get really drowsy after eating.

66
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,050
-There is any salivation during sleep?
-I don't think.

67
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,950
And the worse time has always been the morning of course, in the waking up sometimes

68
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:05,540
I feel trembling and get perspiring, it's like a shock to hear the bell

69
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,470
and I always want to sleep more.

70
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,870
I'm never refreshed. I remember recently I have felt once in my life the wake up at 9 o'clock

71
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,200
a normal time almost and felt refreshed once.

72
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,780
-Only one time? You are improving.

73
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,390
-Not this time, it was earlier, just to know how it feels like.

74
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:41,470
Still it's not refreshed the sleep but I'm able to cope with it, after Causticum.

75
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,370
-All the good happened after Causticum?

76
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,970
-With the sleep yes.

77
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:05,490
With the memory I think is a big problem, even though it is better because I want to study

78
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,090
but I can not.

79
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,740
-Can you give me an example? You forget names?

80
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,570
-I forget names and places and things, what to say, what to do, what to write,

81
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:32,070
what I've just been reading, what I did last day, the name of things.

82
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,580
-All this?

83
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:42,010
-Yes but I think not so often, I don't feel so confused but it can be all these.

84
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:50,910
I think it's a kind of blockage also, when I sit down to read and write I feel restless,

85
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:58,510
I feel bad, I think it has to do with something from school.

86
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,750
-From examinations?

87
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:12,250
-Yes also but I think I can't concentrate but it can also be rather bad,

88
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,930
I can not concentrate at all.

89
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:24,500
When I sit down to study, I read the same page over and over again and I don't seem able to ...

90
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,600
-Have you ever received Baryta carbonica?
-No.

91
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:38,240
But I was pushing myself to study but it made such a negative stress on my whole system,

92
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:49,250
so now recently I just decided I give up, I can not do this. It feels bad because I love Homeopathy

93
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:56,000
and I love to help people and I love to work with this. It makes me frustrating

94
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:04,770
but I like to go faster of course, it's not so long time till the exam.

95
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:12,520
-Tell me more.
-A lot of mess.

96
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:29,000
I think the bad memory makes me feel very insecure, feel lack of self confidence,

97
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:38,930
it's a big problem, so I don't dare to start practicing, open my practice.

98
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:45,080
I feel I don't trust my memory and I'm so scared that I can hurt somebody

99
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,940
to give the wrong treatment, it stops me.

100
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:08,840
I noticed now when it was getting colder it is very much underneath,

101
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:22,700
the coldness I feel in the knees and in the spine and the bones and the neck and the feet.

102
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:30,590
-You feel also the draft or general you feel cold?

103
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:43,260
-Both, the draft I feel very strong, it troubles me, it makes me very restless and uncomfortable.

104
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,690
I can get headache or stiff neck from the draft.

105
00:13:53,690 --> 00:14:01,110
Something that came back more now and aggravated again is a chronic distention and

106
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:10,090
bloatedness which was better for a while but I don't know if it has to do with having strict diet for

107
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:15,190
a while and now again I eat bread and cheese.

108
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,190
-And all these things that upset you.
-Yes.

109
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,890
-So that means you don't actually make any diet now, you eat freely.

110
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:48,220
-I do have a lot of problems with the digestion, I have a lot of pain in the stomach from this

111
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,930
and a lot of gas and bloatedness and often when I eat something I can start hiccup

112
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,350
and belching immediately.

113
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,430
-In the past you have taken Lycopodium?
-I never took Lycopodium.

114
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,010
-Medorrhinum?

115
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:15,190
-Yes I took Medorrhinum, you gave me. Good reactions.

116
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:23,270
-I don't remember you had gonorrhea?
-I had condylomata, not gonorrhea.

117
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,600
-How is your desire for sweets now?

118
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,670
-When I start eating a little bit again it comes back.

119
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,100
-You try to avoid actually?

120
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:48,450
-Yes, it's not so easy for me but I don't eat as much as before, I think.

121
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:14,510
-I wanted to make clear, in the evening you feel better emotionally and mentally and physically?

122
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,190
-Everything.

123
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,020
-You become more alive?
-Yes.

124
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,420
-And in the sea, you still like the sea very much?
-Yes, very much.

125
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:31,180
-You swim every day while you are here?
-Yes.

126
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,260
-What time?
-In the lunch break.

127
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,850
-For how long?

128
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:48,850
-It depends but when it's as warm as this, I like to stay for a long time.

129
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,690
-For one hour?
-Not so much.

130
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,850
-You have anything else?

131
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:17,510
-I remembered that this bloatedness and the troubles with my digestion started

132
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:24,450
when I was 17 years old, then I got some kind of hormonal treatment.

133
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:34,360
My menses had stopped for a year and a doctor gave me some injections.

134
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,510
-And the bloatedness started after the injections.

135
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:42,700
-Yes and the difficulty to tolerate several food started after this.

136
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:50,590
Also the same time I had a lot of these fillings in my teeth, I certainly got a lot of troubles

137
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:56,100
with my teeth and I got the amalgam. So a lot of problems started after this.

138
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:03,350
-How are your menses now, the last 2-3 months.

139
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:09,600
-Two times came 5-6 days earlier and this never happened before.

140
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:26,020
-Do you still have menses stop when lying down?
-Yes. It's very scanty.

141
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,690
-Like it used to be.
-Yes.

142
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,830
-How is your sexual desire?

143
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:46,340
-I got a new boyfriend, so it starts changing.

144
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,840
-Drastically?

145
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:55,330
-Yes because it was almost like an aversion, almost like I had this fear of going into

146
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:07,350
a relationship, trusting anybody again and to be intimate again, give me the creeps

147
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,960
but now it has changed.

148
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:34,040
-Your hair is still falling?
-Yes but maybe a little bit better.

149
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,940
-The desire for oranges is still very strong?

150
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:54,060
-Yes, juicy things but the ice cream I desire also still very much.

151
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:00,530
-Here?
-No, all the time, I eat a lot of ice cream.

152
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:06,700
-Your thirst?
-My thirst is a little down after Arsenicum I think.

153
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:15,550
-Is it for more quantities, frequently?
-No, I can drink more, not only small.

154
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:22,190
-How is the hurriedness?

155
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:29,960
-After deciding not to take the exam, it is better, I can relax more but it's till there,

156
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,950
it's a kind of restlessness because I have a lot of pain in my body physically,

157
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:48,880
I'm not at ease I have a lot of tension, so it's a kind of restlessness but I'm working with it.

158
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,390
But I can have a certain weakness after eating.

159
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,960
-After eating sweets?

160
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:08,630
-General after eating I can feel very weak.

161
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,460
-That means sometimes you feel, sometimes you don't.

162
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:21,950
-Yes and it comes out of the blue. Recently I just had some spaghetti and cooked

163
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:29,280
vegetable on it, I had some cheese on it and my boyfriend was sitting there and eating

164
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:33,890
but I almost collapsed for several hours, I could hardly even talk to him.

165
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:44,040
Maybe I ate too much but I don't think it was that much. I think fat more and more disturbs me.

166
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:48,700
-What about bread?
-Yes also.

167
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:55,190
-The bread definitely. The bread it was something you discovered that it was aggravating you since...

168
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:02,360
-Since I was 17 and nobody told me, people told me everybody tolerates bread, so just

169
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,440
continue and I could not understand.

170
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,180
-And it could create diarrhea for you?

171
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:16,440
-Yes and I gained 10 kilos and eating has to do with my memory also.

172
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:23,020
When I fast I feel very clear in my mind and also if I keep a strict diet,

173
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:29,460
it really makes me easier to think.

174
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,440
It's like an intoxication almost from food.

175
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,040
-Yes exactly.

176
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,580
How is the washing of your hands?

177
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:55,000
-It's still there but I try to force myself not to be so obsessive with this but it's still there.

178
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:02,820
-How is your postponing?

179
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:10,810
-I had to go home now to prepare this because I postponed it and I have to go out

180
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,250
and I have to do it in the last minute.

181
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:24,310
-The rheumatic pain in the extremities, the joints, you were complaining last time

182
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:29,390
for pains in the joints. You don't remember?

183
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,580
-Not specifically.

184
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,330
-There is any perspiration now?

185
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:53,410
-When it's warm of course I perspire easily when I walk.

186
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,420
-Is it odor offensive?

187
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:06,240
-Not really I think but after a lot of the remedies I can have more strong odor from the axilla.

188
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,730
-This desire for open air is still there?
-Very much.

189
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,190
-Though you feel the cold, the desire for open air is still very much.

190
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:35,480
-Yes. Generally I feel also better in the open air, walking slowly in the open air makes also

191
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,470
the mentally part better.

192
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:46,230
I can think more clearly, sitting is really bad for me, to sit still I feel restless.

193
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,560
-Anything else?

194
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,500
-I also feel the circulation in my whole body is no good, the legs and the neck.

195
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,900
-You feel the draft in the neck?

196
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,230
-The circulation, I feel there is no enough oxygen to my brain, it's like it gets stuck

197
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:24,500
in a cramp, in a block in the neck and I'm always much worse after sleeping.

198
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,150
-You had several examinations in your life, I believe.

199
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:41,750
It was any time any problem with your liver?
-Not in the blood examinations.

200
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,950
-Never found anything or you did not examine it.

201
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:59,200
-The blood examples never showed I think but I had believing that it all came from my liver,

202
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:09,500
it had to do with my liver but it didn't show in the blood but all therapists told me this also.

203
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:20,000
I was drinking too much alcohol before and I was having medication for years.

204
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:34,490
I noticed now that I react very strongly to noises, I need a lot of peace and quietness.

205
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:42,070
I need to be very much alone, to feel the inner state, to meditate.

206
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,570
-In touch with yourself?

207
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:53,750
-Yes and also to talk with god, I need this very much, to feel happy and complete.

208
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,920
So every time I can go alone, I feel joy and relief.

209
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,170
-You feel good.

210
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:12,230
-And small noises really annoy me, people scratching and talking,

211
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:15,830
especially talking and the voice.

212
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:41,000
I also noticed that this sudden weakness can come after grief or mortification, disappointment,

213
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:52,500
I suddenly lose all strength but still I have a big problem with electricity.

214
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,010
I noticed this with all the computers.

215
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:58,500
-You feel the effect?

216
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:04,570
-Very much and always I have a very bad time during the whole winter

217
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:11,490
when I have to put electricity on. Sometimes I even think of buying a cottage, living without electricity

218
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:17,160
it's really bothering me and it also has to do with the studying.

219
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:25,910
I have to study in the night and I have to put some light on and the light disturbs me so much,

220
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:36,420
to have it near by my head gets like a bursting feeling in my head, I'm very restless.

221
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:47,150
-You must avoid transformers. The lights which transform ,

222
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,090
these make a big electromagnetic fields.

223
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:13,990
Still I'm over sensitive to all extra impressions, noises, cruelties and if people are angry

224
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,910
the suffering of others.

225
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:23,990
-Did you show any anger during this time?
-No.

226
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,490
-With your parents you communicated?
-Not much.

227
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:32,090
I showed a little bit anger to my mother.

228
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:53,000
I was able to stand up more and not feel only weak but I still like to have some more protection

229
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:59,350
because I always go alone to protect myself.

230
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:12,000
-When you say protection, you mean some physical protection or emotional?

231
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,590
-I want to be more strong.

232
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,420
-Somebody to protect you, to have somebody who look after you.

233
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:30,920
-No, just to be able to be with a lot of people, I get weak from talking and it takes a lot of energy

234
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:41,160
for me and I can feel the feelings of others in it, it drains me from energy

235
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,100
but it's a little bit better after Causticum.

236
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:54,330
I'm not so open and with the fears I think the fear of dogs is a little bit better

237
00:30:54,430 --> 00:31:04,080
but still there and the fear of heights is also better but a new one has occurred.

238
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:14,510
I had 2 times the dream with this huge wave coming towards me 100 m and I started having

239
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,260
some fear about this.

240
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,670
-A wave in the sea?
-Yes, a wave rising up 100 m.

241
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,440
-A flood coming over you?
-Yes.

242
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,420
-When did you dream that?
-2 months ago.

243
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:42,500
-When did you have this boyfriend?
-It was similar time.

244
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,520
-Do you understand what it is?
-Yes.

245
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:01,770
-I don't have to explain.
-Fear of earthquakes sometimes.

246
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:14,170
-You ask the Greeks, they say the amount of sedatives, they have gone sky high,

247
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:19,520
the whole population is using these sedatives to be able to face this fear.

248
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:35,260
-And all these videos make me feel nauseous. I also desire to hear very much music and

249
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:42,930
when I'm here I don't here so much and I feel abstinence, it really makes me feel very good

250
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,940
and also to be out in nature, I need this a lot.

251
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,700
-Your boyfriend is here with you?
-No.

252
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:15,090
I don't think I've told you before, I 'm very sensitive I don't tolerate any tight clothing anywhere.

253
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,830
Maybe because of the bloatedness, it gives pain.

254
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:26,480
-How is your desire for salty things?
-A little bit more.

255
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,680
-For pepper?

256
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:39,410
-I like spicy food but I don't tolerate so much, it gives me diarrhea from spicy food.

257
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:55,560
I'm very sensitive to odors, I usually get nauseated and even though I'm very cold

258
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,000
I don't tolerate too much heat on my head.

259
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:05,200
I noticed on the beach yesterday, I got very much heat on my head and I had to put it under the water

260
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:11,010
and I got throbbing, this heartbeat in the air, it feels like bursting.

261
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:19,150
And it's the same feeling as if when I walk if I walk a little bit and have exertion,

262
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:28,650
if I walk fast I get the same feeling all this congestion to my head and it can also be

263
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:35,750
with blurred vision. So it makes not do any exercise, I cannot do anything.

264
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,340
-It's OK.

265
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:02,510
-You want to say to the class what you told me? You can, say it.

266
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:20,740
-I just told that with this boyfriend I had a very good feeling of being very childish again

267
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:31,410
and play around and he is helping me like cure my inner child and he sings for me

268
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:35,260
and I really can relax and sleep, I feel like this little child.

269
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:44,680
-He lullabies you to sleep, he sings for you to sleep.

270
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,330
This was an important information.

271
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:42,970
What shall we do?
-Homework.

272
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:48,320
-No homework again.

273
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,000
-I just tell you the remedy and then we go.

274
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,300
No, I have to explain why should I give the remedy, again?

275
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:09,790
Can once give a remedy without explanation?
-No.

276
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:30,110
-When I was in India, in the Calcutta College, there was Dr. Bose who has studied with Kent

277
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:41,490
in America and he was considered as very good prescriber, very fast and very good.

278
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,140
He was 84 years old by the time I was there, in 1964.

279
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:59,570
He was 84, you can imagine being in America in the end years of Kent.

280
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,070
He used to describe Kent as a very irritable man.

281
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:14,250
He says, if you did not know the Theory, you could forget that you pass the class.

282
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:30,980
Anything else you could forget except of Theory and he used to prescribe,

283
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:36,750
see a case what do you have, OK.

284
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,390
Before the patient was speaking he had written a remedy

285
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:48,250
and always the students we asked him why?

286
00:38:50,330 --> 00:39:06,590
He never gave an answer, go and study, he had a strong voice, go and study, he never said anything.

287
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,810
He never explained why he gave.

288
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:22,000
Most probably because he did not know of course. He could not justify.

289
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:33,730
In India you could see a scene like this, we were about 30 students around

290
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:40,790
and he was sitting there and there was a big queue of patients that he had to finish within 1 hour,

291
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,790
about 100 patients.

292
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:53,380
The patient was coming and he was putting his hand here or here, wherever he put his hand,

293
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:59,980
he gave the remedy because we could not hear the symptoms.

294
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:06,040
And then I had somebody who would explain to me Hindi, what did he say? Nothing.

295
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:19,900
What did he say? Nothing. Go and study. You are more spoiled, I would say.

296
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:35,160
The remedy at this moment or the choice should be between Lycopodium and Baryta carbonica.

297
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:45,980
For both of these remedies we have quite good indications.

298
00:40:46,980 --> 00:41:00,230
Which one of the two shall we choose? When I was coming to the class I choose Lycopodium,

299
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:08,570
before entering the class she told me this story with her boyfriend.

300
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,150
You understand now what I'm going to chose.

301
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:22,630
The idea is of course the memory, the self-confidence which is lacking,

302
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:28,960
the lack of concentration, can not read, can not study, can not remember what she studies

303
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:37,560
and the idea of like to be cuddled.

304
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,240
She described it very well. She said, he sings and I sleep and I feel like a child.

305
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:59,220
This is a good description for Baryta carbonica. So Baryta carbonica.

306
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:02,320
What potency? 200.

307
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:12,470
She also suffers with a syndrome which we have been discussing for Norway

308
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:20,320
which is mal absorption syndrome. She is suffering with that and we actually treat that syndrome.

309
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:32,050
She is improving already, she has improved but it's very interesting what she says,

310
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:39,310
I don't believe it exactly as she said it, after the hormones but she had degraded her organism

311
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:46,050
through taking different drugs etc. and then hormones came and the whole system went down

312
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:53,070
and she developed the pathology in which she lived for 20 years?

313
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:02,980
How many?
-I'm 43.

314
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:13,980
-More than 20, I thought it was less than 20.

315
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:27,240
Anyhow I think with Baryta carbonica now which we have a better picture,

316
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:43,140
she will have quite a good jump. Did you understand what it means the waves that she saw?

317
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,880
You understood?
-No.

318
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,720
-The big waves that came over her?

319
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,810
-Phase one?

320
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:16,780
-It is the overwhelming feelings that raised because of this meeting with this man.

321
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:26,370
They are strong feelings coming inside and she felt in her sleep that she will be drowned

322
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:33,970
in these feeling, there are so many that she can be drowned or there was a danger of being drowned.

323
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:40,550
Is this correct? Say yes more strongly.

324
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:56,550
So it's not actually reading her thoughts, it is knowing and understanding human nature.

325
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:07,560
This dream is characteristic when the emotions are over flowing.

326
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,730
And usually occurs at the beginning of a love affair.

327
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:32,470
When you see such a dream, you know what state you are, phase one.

328
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:48,380
-Tell me what happened, on October 99 prescribed Baryta carbonica 200

329
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,640
and you will tell what happened.

330
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:59,460
-In the beginning of December I took the remedy because of some very strong symptoms

331
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:11,790
I wanted to wait first. I had no initial aggravation but

332
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:19,150
because I went to dental root treatment, I think I antidoted the remedy.

333
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:26,810
-When was the dental?
-Middle of February, 2, 5 months.

334
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:31,210
-Did you repeat after dental treatment?

335
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:38,340
-I repeated, this thing to the root I had terrible pain and suddenly came to the weekend

336
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,120
and I had no pain killers, so the first thing I did, I repeated once.

337
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:48,630
And it took away the pain for 1 hour and then I had a really good reaction

338
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,460
because at the same time I was having  these tooth problems.

339
00:46:52,560 --> 00:47:01,130
One week before I had a very strong flu, so I was lying in bed I was really exhausted and very weak

340
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:11,790
and immediately after the remedy, I felt muscle power that I never feel, I feel so no power

341
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:19,760
and I was doing ballet for 1 hour, from lying in bed for a week, I was dancing around

342
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:28,710
but then that pain came back and then I got weak again. And then I tried Hypericum because...

343
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,300
-You did not repeat again?
-No.

344
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,940
-Why you did not repeat again?
-Because I was not thinking.

345
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,780
-Because you did not like the remedy and you wanted another.

346
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,180
-You did Hypericum and what it did?

347
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:50,020
-Nothing, then I tried to get some pain killers, not to take anything more.

348
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:53,770
Hypericum helped me because these problems have been for a long time.

349
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:55,530
-Yes but not this time.

350
00:47:55,630 --> 00:48:01,870
-But it had saved other teeth, so I don't have to do the root treatment.

351
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,370
-So what did you do finally?

352
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:09,790
You went to the dentist?
-Yes I had to, I was maybe 10 days.

353
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:16,050
-And then he had to kill the nerve?
-Yes because it was dead already.

354
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,120
-It was dead maybe from the pain.

355
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:25,310
-I don't know, for a long time, it was a big infection and I had pain all over.

356
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,050
-What other remedy except of Hypericum, did you take another remedy?

357
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,390
-No.

358
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:36,800
-You took pain killers and then you went to the dentist, how long it lasted the whole thing?

359
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:42,650
-I had to go several times because it was so much inflammation.

360
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:46,850
-He gave you antibiotics which you did not take.
-I did not take.

361
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:53,650
-So I know your character by now.
-Taking nothing more.

362
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:12,050
And I had a milder acute in April with coryza and bronchitis, it lasted several weeks

363
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:23,290
but it was not so aggressive. So generally I feel better, more centered and together,

364
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:31,040
I think that's slowly from several remedies, I feel more inside in me.

365
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:36,390
-In contact.
-Yes and a little more peace.

366
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:56,140
-It's about time.
-Emotionally, I feel very good.

367
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:08,400
I have this wonderful relationship and I'm still in love and this is very good

368
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:14,820
but physically I still have a lot of the symptoms remaining and also mentally.

369
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:20,170
-Can you tell?
-Mentally is the memory.

370
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:27,320
-You are not happy still with the memory, the memory is not as it should be.

371
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:36,910
-No and I have difficulty in following, it's difficult to evaluate, is it better, is it worse,

372
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:39,020
so much happening in my life now.

373
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,660
-With the patients you mean or here?

374
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:50,410
-Everything, with you is OK because you talk slow but I really have to make notes

375
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:54,760
and I don't follow; so it's annoying.

376
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:06,180
-Next?
-The chronic fatigue I think still is not so much better.

377
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,200
-Still is a problem?

378
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:20,030
-The self-confidence also has not changed so much.

379
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:24,920
-You are not having enough self-confidence.

380
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:43,750
-No, it's really disturbing my life very much. I feel mal absorption you mentioned last time.

381
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:52,840
I have lots of problems with the food and with the digestion.

382
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:57,530
-Still you have reaction to food. Which food and what reaction?

383
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:01,760
-It's a lot of food.

384
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,030
-Like?

385
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:16,370
-Like bread, vinegar, everything mixed with several things, it's mostly...

386
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:26,280
-You said vinegar?
-Yes, a lot of things contain vinegar.

387
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,370
-In food.
-Yes.

388
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:43,350
So I often choose not to eat, I feel so much better going on a fast, then I also feel hurriedness.

389
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:48,180
-What about others like rice, spaghetti?

390
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:57,510
-Spaghetti is not good, the energy is going, I can drop during while I'm eating

391
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,370
and I have to lay down.

392
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:11,780
I think I never mentioned that when I get so nervous I get so dry in the mouth, very much.

393
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,790
To the unrefreshed sleep I think Causticum really helped me.

394
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,440
-So you don't have unrefreshed sleep now?

395
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:35,870
-Yes but the time I took Causticum I'm jumping...

396
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,020
-You took Causticum?

397
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,770
-That was earlier, that time I told you I took.

398
00:53:43,870 --> 00:53:47,530
-Yes but what I did not understand about Causticum,

399
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:51,020
it helped you with the unrefreshing sleep, what did you say?

400
00:53:51,120 --> 00:54:02,130
-Yes, I didn't feel so bad in the morning. The unrefreshed sleep is really the problem.

401
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:06,600
-At this moment it is one of your main problems.

402
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,030
-And the things I told.

403
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:25,600
I told you last time about the sleep problems with the difficulty of falling asleep and

404
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:38,440
frequent waking and it's difficult to find the right temperature, I'm always cold

405
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:48,930
but I can have flushes at night of heat and very restless, so there is a lot of disturbances around

406
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,620
the sleep still.

407
00:54:56,290 --> 00:55:02,360
And what is really bothering me very much is, because we try to find a place to live,

408
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:12,270
a house or rent, it's very difficult to find a place to live because I have all these allergies

409
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,700
to all the different things.

410
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:23,210
-You mean in Oslo?
-Yes about Oslo.

411
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:36,860
So all the things from inside the house, the carpets, the materials bother me so much

412
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:47,600
and the electricity is a huge problem. I've given up to read, to study because

413
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:57,620
to sit underneath electric lamps is very much a problem.

414
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:01,200
-Next?

415
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:13,130
-The postponing, my boyfriend tells me, tell him this.

416
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:22,880
-Postponing for small matters or only for big issues?
-Most things.

417
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:30,450
-Next?

418
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:52,340
-I still feel I have problem with too much coming in that I can protect.

419
00:56:52,440 --> 00:57:00,170
-You are affected by emotions of others or by something happens outside,

420
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:05,440
an accident something happens and then you are affected?

421
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:06,430
-Everything.

422
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:11,420
-Or just any emotion that other people have, you are affected by this?

423
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,600
-Yes.

424
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:21,100
I hardly see my parents anymore because it's very difficult to have contact,

425
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:32,090
it's very chaotic and nervous, tension and 1 min even though I come in piece, in 1 min

426
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,860
and I fall apart.

427
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:43,370
-They can disturb you.
-This also was better with Causticum.

428
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:57,450
-Which is the worst time for you?
-Always waking up.

429
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:01,780
-The next worse?

430
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:12,200
-The getting up in the morning, always better towards the evening and the night.

431
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:20,670
-Night you mean even after midnight as you were saying last time you feel amelioration?

432
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:30,270
-Yes and then also I'm more clear in my head and everything is going easier,

433
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:34,860
I feel also more strength in my body.

434
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:47,110
-Do you have a lot of gas from wrong food?
-Yes a lot.

435
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:50,260
-I told you last time about this distention.

436
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:56,450
-It's there, correct?
-Yes and also eructation.

437
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:08,530
-How much sweets you require?
-A lot.

438
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:21,020
-Do you have still this weakness after eating?

439
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:32,430
-Yes if it's the wrong food which I have intolerance to, it can come so sudden, very sudden.

440
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:35,430
-This coldness in the spine do you remember?

441
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,540
-It's still there, I feel the draft.

442
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,770
-The coldness in the knee?

443
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:50,020
-Yes in the patella, little draft, little cold is in the spine, in the back and in the knee,

444
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,290
in the bones.

445
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:58,020
-As much as before?
-I think so.

446
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:13,370
-Perspiration?

447
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:25,070
-Easily at exercising or just walking and at night could be not so much perspiration

448
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:32,630
but I feel really warm and flashes of heat but I don't get really wet.

449
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:44,850
-The lack of self-confidence is the same as the last time you think or it is less

450
01:00:44,950 --> 01:00:52,120
or is it more?
-I tried to evaluate, it's difficult for me.

451
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:10,610
-You have something else, otherwise we finished.
-The coldness is very big problem.

452
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:15,450
-But still you like open air?
-Yes.

453
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:28,200
-I'll give you Pulsatilla, no? You like it?
-Even though I'm so cold? OK.

454
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:25,040
You know now why I like India, she will bring my tea before I ask her, she will bring the tea.

455
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:43,860
Now what happened with her case is that Baryta carbonica unfortunately was not left alone to act,

456
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,370
there was this interference.

457
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:57,760
So we don't know how much, how far it could have taken the case but my question now

458
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:09,300
is from what she says, because the patient always stresses that which bothers him in the end

459
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:17,110
and I could see the problems that are bothering her at this moment are problems

460
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,290
that belong to Lycopodium.

461
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:28,710
Therefore previously symptomatology Lycopodium, now symptomatology Lycopodium.

462
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:39,930
So the indication is that most probably the remedy which is coming is not anymore Baryta carbonica,

463
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:45,360
maybe Baryta carbonica will come back again but now at this moment the remedy

464
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:48,380
which is coming uppermost is Lycopodium.

465
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:12,870
Who has not seen this case from the beginning?

466
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:45,960
It's not the summary which is important, to see the real case from the beginning will be different.

467
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:59,800
Do you remember? There is any difference?
-Sure.

468
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:09,050
-What did you say?
-There is big difference yes.

469
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:22,610
-But you did not say when you were sitting down there. Now shall we give Lycopodium or

470
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:26,210
we'll punish her because she did not say?

471
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:32,050
We'll punish her to wait.

472
01:05:54,130 --> 01:06:08,870
She will jump on me, I have to go out. Don't punish her, very interesting

473
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:17,950
but it was very interesting when I did something I can't remember where 2 Causticums

474
01:06:18,050 --> 01:06:24,290
were in the class and jumped on me. Oh my god.

475
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:36,120
You see the difference between sympathetic Causticum and sympathetic Phosphorus.

476
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:51,030
Phosphorus will not be aggressive revolutionary, there is a kind of aggressive reaction

477
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:54,030
from Causticum towards someone who is suffering,

478
01:06:54,130 --> 01:07:01,290
they will not just say poor him like Phosphorus, no.

479
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:07,790
They have to do something, they jump and say, you bastard come here.

480
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:19,130
They will pick a fight on the street with an unknown person, even if they know

481
01:07:19,230 --> 01:07:24,870
the other person is stronger they can not resist, they will just try to kill him

482
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:31,560
because he is doing something to the animals or to humans.

483
01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:45,700
So Causticum is very sympathetic but acts upon that, Phosphorus is very sympathetic

484
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:54,220
but suffers mostly. They don't act especially violently.

485
01:07:56,130 --> 01:08:00,720
Therefore what shall we do with her, I don't know.

486
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:07,200
I'll tell you something, I leave it up to you, when you feel like taking a remedy,

487
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:13,520
take Lycopodium. A big decision.

488
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:19,460
She can not take a decision, so I know it will take 6 months before she takes a remedy,

489
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:24,710
which is good.

490
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:33,110
I have to see what Baryta carbonica has done finally. When finally decides to take Lycop

491
01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:40,210
that means the Baryta has done all it could, it has brought her to a point to make a decision.

492
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:57,530
I'm very happy with the development of this case, I'm very happy

493
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:06,610
and Lycopodium is really she will need it because at this moment most of her problems

494
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:14,370
coming from digestive system, there is no question she is suffering with mal absorption syndrome,

495
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:24,860
celiac sprue  what they call and there is gas, distention, burps, eructations,

496
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:32,200
unrefreshed sleep waking up in the morning, there is lack of self-confidence,

497
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:38,950
she is still not very much happy to speak in front of the public

498
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:50,210
but has Baryta carbonica finished its action? This is what I'm ...

499
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:11,690
-Since the Baryta carb worked so well in the acute situation after which she then

500
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:16,360
had the treatment in pain killers and so on, I could imagine it acted

501
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:22,370
but it was used up very quickly do you think it is worth repeating the same potency now

502
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:26,940
because there is still many indications also from Baryta carb to see if there is

503
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:31,040
any further action before changing to a new remedy?

504
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:42,950
-Well this is a good thought and one of the things I'm thinking but if you remember last

505
01:10:43,050 --> 01:10:50,200
time the main thing she said, my memory, my lack of self-confidence,

506
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:57,440
it was absolutely clear what was bothering her. When we came out the other things were there

507
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:59,450
but they were mentioned as secondary.

508
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:05,750
Now she says, my main problem is I can not get up in the morning, I can not be refreshed,

509
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:12,700
I'm very tired in the morning, I'm better after 10 o'clock in the night, I'm more clear,

510
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,310
12 o'clock even better.

511
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:23,530
These are all keynotes of Lycopodium plus the distention is there.

512
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:28,860
Baryta carbonica takes away whatever it could, whatever belonged to Lycopodium

513
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:38,280
as an underlined remedy, Baryta carb did not touch. Now Lycopodium has to be given, when?

514
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:44,620
This is my problem because of the interference of the dental treatment. That's all.

515
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:51,380
Otherwise I would be able to judge but this interference you see how confuses you.

516
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:58,210
-She antidoted the remedy with the dental treatment?

517
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:06,140
-Not entirely, partially. Maybe, I don't know.

518
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:16,540
-I would like to know if you have seen more often people after the right remedy having

519
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,610
inflammation of their nerves.

520
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:24,040
If their teeth have been bad before, I have seen it after the right remedy it came very immediately.

521
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:29,540
It's because of the treatment, they have closed them up the teeth, so you have to open them

522
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:34,390
and leave them open which they don't do anymore, it's really a problem.

523
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:43,120
-This is a good remark, I have seen it many time with the right remedy the teeth,

524
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:49,480
the gums become inflamed and you have a lot of problems around the teeth and the gums.

525
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:55,620
As soon as the organism becomes strong, it brings out an inflammation

526
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:57,280
and where is this inflammation?

527
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:03,390
Many times in the teeth and the gums, that is true.

528
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:18,380
I don't want to spoil the case. I believe that you are in a level of Lycopodium.

529
01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:28,120
-I also have experience of dental problems coming up after giving a good remedy and

530
01:13:28,220 --> 01:13:30,200
having an aggravation.

531
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:37,530
I guess my question is, are you recommending that dental work be held of for a period of time

532
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:43,720
or would you recommend homeopathic treatment prior to any dental intervention?

533
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:52,950
It's being my experience that the majority in my cases the main complains have been ameliorated

534
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:58,540
prior to the dental work and then after the dental work, the nature of the case changes

535
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,430
and a new remedy picture comes up.

536
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:13,710
-I can not say that but it is true when the dental problems are strong, you can not say wait

537
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:17,540
because it's very bothering.

538
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:26,870
It's also true that many of the dental problems have been cured by homeopathic remedy,

539
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:33,710
instead of sending them to the doctors you give a remedy and the patient goes alone.

540
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:40,540
It's also true that you give a remedy or 2 or 3 and nothing happens or very little happens

541
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,630
and you have to end up by sending them to the dentist.

542
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:52,540
It is also true that after dental treatment there is a relapse, it's also true that sometimes

543
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:56,540
after dental treatment there is another remedy which is indicated.

544
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,640
So we have all these possibilities.

545
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:02,730
Would you like that?

546
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:16,980
You take a Lycopodium 200 one month from now, if your case remains as it is.

547
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:24,560
The same more or less, you take Lycopodium 200 but wait one more month.
