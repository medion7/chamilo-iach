1
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:37,487
This is a case of a young girl who was having a diagnosis of pubertas praecox

2
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:46,295
which means having menses very early in life

3
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:55,502
and one of the symptoms is that they don’t grow.

4
00:00:55,966 --> 00:01:07,726
She is already 1,63 m by the time you measured her she was 1,64 m,

5
00:01:08,214 --> 00:01:16,350
one centimeter more. Sometimes she had colds with fever,

6
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:21,294
a few times, she had a bad stomach with vomiting in the last year.

7
00:01:22,007 --> 00:01:30,279
A bit of acne and dry skin. A bit of acne, I don’t see it.

8
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:42,935
Her menses is coming every month now. She also likes to eat a lot.

9
00:01:43,335 --> 00:01:53,991
Before menses she experiences pain, is she anxious, is she crying more easily,

10
00:01:54,334 --> 00:01:59,918
is she more irritable, is she more depressed?</br>– Normal.

11
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:04,630
– Before menses.</br>– No, nothing. She is normal.

12
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:13,342
– During menses she has pains?</br>– No.

13
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:23,455
– Once in school there was some pain, she had menses but it was only a single time.

14
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:32,814
– She has constipation, she has stool every 2 or 3 days.</br>– Yes.

15
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:41,975
– And big quantity. From this she has sometimes cracks on the anus and some bleeding.

16
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:49,550
– This must be very intense, the mother told me it’s very extreme.</br>– The pain?

17
00:02:50,390 --> 00:03:00,158
– The pain and the quantity, both. 
– She is very lazy, dislikes sports.

18
00:03:02,614 --> 00:03:11,583
She has to do sports in the school?</br>– 2 times a week.

19
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:23,502
– What she likes to do? She likes more to study, to read stories, to watch TV,

20
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:27,879
to play with the computer? What does she like the most?

21
00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:37,191
– She likes computer a lot and to play with the iPad.

22
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:58,206
– What would she like to become? Electronic engineer?

23
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:06,296
– In the meanwhile she understands you, her English is getting better.

24
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:17,463
– Most of it, I can see from her reactions. Sometimes she is really awkward,

25
00:04:17,974 --> 00:04:31,006
she feels awkward. Is she pushing things as she passes by? Is that what she means?

26
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:37,926
– Sometimes she pushes things.

27
00:04:38,326 --> 00:04:45,374
– She is not careful.</br>– Yes. Spills some liquids.

28
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:55,559
– Especially when she doesn’t like what she has to do and has some little injuries then.

29
00:04:56,686 --> 00:05:02,782
Very sensitive to critique and lack of self-confidence and irresolution.

30
00:05:04,398 --> 00:05:17,582
Fear of not being loved easily. Sensitive to criticism. Likes to cuddle a lot.

31
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:33,150
Her fears are still to call somebody on the telephone. Needs the mother to do this.

32
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:39,798
But in general she is more independent now.

33
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:44,577
She can be very easily offended and also very loud.

34
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:51,878
When she is offended, how does she react? What is she doing, shouts, throw things?

35
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:02,566
– She doesn’t know. She throws the books on the floor sometimes.

36
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:07,054
– Not against somebody.</br>– No.

37
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:16,751
– In general she feels more the cold or the heat or it’s normal, can tolerate both?

38
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:32,782
– She was always hot but more normal she likes to cool down,

39
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:39,358
she even jumps into a cold pool, she likes to cool down most of the time.

40
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:43,223
She prefers to be in cold rooms, cold pools.

41
00:06:45,718 --> 00:06:51,494
– Quite often she has a very bad mood maybe from so much stress in school.

42
00:06:52,942 --> 00:07:01,670
She is medium in the class or upper, lower?</br>– This year she works very much.

43
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:12,021
Because in the first school she learned nothing, it’s kind of a Montessori school, no lessons…

44
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:29,693
This year she went in high school and learned back from the first year and the second.

45
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:44,781
She was medium and it was ok.
 – She is very good and active with PC, iPad etc.

46
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:54,310
That is becoming a symptom lately! We have to treat it in the children!

47
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:59,477
– I think many mothers admire their children for doing this thing better than them.

48
00:08:00,077 --> 00:08:05,774
– yes because they leave them quite, they are busy with the computer

49
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:13,678
and they can do whatever they like. She is still a warm person, especially during the night.

50
00:08:14,062 --> 00:08:18,590
Sometimes sweating all over in the night, in the head also.

51
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:45,134
If I ask her what is her favorite food what would she say?

52
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:51,150
– Salad or meat. Wiener schnitzel.

53
00:08:55,222 --> 00:09:01,670
– And what is that she cannot tolerate, she doesn’t like, any food?

54
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,646
–She eats onions?</br>– Yes.

55
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:21,940
– If the meat has some fat in it, can she eat it?</br>– She doesn’t like it.

56
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:32,478
– Has she lately noticed that she wants more salt in her food?

57
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:48,421
– No. she doesn’t like salt so much, only a little bit for the taste.

58
00:09:49,325 --> 00:10:00,158
– If it is a little bit more she may not like it?</br>– Nothing special.

59
00:10:05,478 --> 00:10:13,294
– How she tolerates the sun?</br>– She can tolerate it well.

60
00:10:15,261 --> 00:10:20,141
– The school is mixed, boys and girls?</br>– Yes.

61
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:38,981
– You like any boy particularly in the school?</br>– Yes. 3.

62
00:10:40,437 --> 00:10:48,709
– It was my prediction. Out of the 3 she likes one the most.

63
00:10:49,150 --> 00:11:02,918
– No, 3 want her and she likes the one.</br>– I want to ask

64
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:23,886
if she can urinate in front of others, in a public restroom. Can you ask this?

65
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:31,927
- I will try.</br>– Strange question.

66
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:47,334
– Ok, forget it. What makes her feel more sensitive to criticism?

67
00:11:48,302 --> 00:11:53,398
If they put her down, if somebody makes a bad remark

68
00:11:54,159 --> 00:12:01,871
or if there is even the idea of a bad remark she may be hurt?

69
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:08,830
I want to understand how deep she is sensitive to criticism.

70
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,878
– Putting her down is the worst, especially from the mother

71
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:26,927
and not from the schoolmates. The sport teacher maybe making remarks.

72
00:12:30,702 --> 00:12:42,918
– This is for her father; Is she an obedient child or disobedient?

73
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:50,862
Is she trying to please you with whatever you tell her to do or she will have a reaction?

74
00:12:52,918 --> 00:13:08,383
– She is obedient most of the time. 90%</br>- And she will try not to make you unhappy…

75
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:17,686
The relationship with her mother is good?</br>– Sometimes a bit difficult.

76
00:13:19,302 --> 00:13:29,022
She is easy-going with the father. For example when she is getting stressed with her

77
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,183
she wants to go somewhere for holidays

78
00:13:32,663 --> 00:13:36,950
and the mother doesn’t want to hear about that, so they crash.

79
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:49,198
– Will she confront her mother?</br>– She has a certain aversion to her mother

80
00:13:50,438 --> 00:13:55,631
when her mother is just exploding because of this question, for example.

81
00:13:57,214 --> 00:14:05,614
– She likes sweets?</br> – She prefers chips, she prefers sour things.

82
00:14:06,327 --> 00:14:14,334
– Chips are salty.</br>– On chips she likes salt.

83
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:23,991
– She said she doesn’t like salt.</br>– In the food. On chips salt is ok.

84
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:29,414
– Eggs?</br>– No.

85
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,054
– What she doesn’t like in eggs?</br>– The yellow one.

86
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:42,470
– She eats the white?</br>– Yes, sometimes.

87
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:55,367
– If the white is not properly cooked and is still slimy she can eat it?</br>– Yes.

88
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:10,230
– Fish?</br>– She likes octopus, but not so much the fish.

89
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:14,862
– Calamari?</br>– Yes.

90
00:15:18,406 --> 00:15:25,238
– She has any other fear? Fear of dark, of thunderstorms?

91
00:15:26,238 --> 00:15:33,190
– When she was younger she had fear of thunder but now it’s gone.

92
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:52,542
– How many years is she getting treatment, 5? No, 7 years. I am treating her for 7 years.

93
00:15:57,814 --> 00:16:10,657
When you sleep your feet in bed are cold or hot or normal?</br>– Normal.

94
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:18,174
– She doesn’t need to stick them out of covers.</br>– Yes, sometimes she does it.

95
00:16:18,798 --> 00:16:34,206
– She is lazy only with sports and lessons or she is lazy with everything?

96
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:41,654
– Most of the things.

97
00:16:42,254 --> 00:16:50,894
– When you see her room, is it in order or it’s like a bombarded house?

98
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:59,238
– It is mostly normal.</br>– So, she puts order herself.

99
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,341
– Sometimes her mother does, but normally she puts in certain order herself

100
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:17,247
but not extremely. But the mother says to me she is always minimalistic,

101
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:23,774
she doesn’t do a lot, she is generally more on the lazy side.

102
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,855
Absolutely what is necessary and not more.

103
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:36,246
– The sweating in the night is so much that she has to change clothes?

104
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:43,583
– Not so much.</br>– And is it all over or in certain areas?

105
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:53,175
– Especially in the cervical region, she denies that the whole body is sweating.

106
00:17:57,862 --> 00:18:06,118
– Mostly head and cervical.</br>- Concerning the sweets we were talking about,

107
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,030
she likes sweet in the morning.

108
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:18,125
She eats sweets but in the evening she tries not to eat too much, to stay slim.

109
00:18:18,774 --> 00:18:29,574
– But she likes sweets.</br>– But before she said... hot chocolate.

110
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:43,168
– What kind of books she likes?</br>– Phantasy stories with dragons.

111
00:18:43,534 --> 00:18:47,542
– Science fiction?</br>– Yes.

112
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:57,030
– Is she asking questions about life, about God?

113
00:19:01,302 --> 00:19:08,408
– Sometimes I speak with her about God and what is happening in the universe.

114
00:19:08,862 --> 00:19:12,335
– She wants to know, she is interested.

115
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:18,318
– Yes, but not every time. Sometimes I can speak with her.

116
00:19:40,318 --> 00:19:55,086
How many of you know this syndrome pubertas praecox? Let me see. Very few.

117
00:20:03,638 --> 00:20:14,326
It’s quite a serious condition, is considered so serious

118
00:20:15,102 --> 00:20:25,046
that the government has some laws on this because children do not grow

119
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:34,623
and they are supposed to have menses at the age of 5 or 6 years old

120
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:42,558
and the consequences of that premature menses

121
00:20:44,062 --> 00:20:53,206
and the anomaly in the condition of the hormones is quite serious

122
00:20:54,055 --> 00:21:03,142
and they have a special treatment which the parents are supposed to give by force.

123
00:21:05,503 --> 00:21:21,999
The treatment is hormones but with no much effect

124
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:31,918
because they try to suppress the menses again and again. This is not the idea.

125
00:21:34,374 --> 00:21:45,166
She has been doing extremely well, she has been growing normal,

126
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:53,854
her menses came and stopped during the treatment, now she’s 12 years old,

127
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:59,294
with normal menses I see no problem,

128
00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:11,094
no premenstrual syndrome someone would expect, no problem.

129
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:22,941
The problem seems to be a kind of oversensitivity to criticism.

130
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:33,854
This is the only problem I see in the moment. There is a kind of constipation

131
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:46,870
but still the colon is emptied it holds for 2 days

132
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:53,862
but the third day she has a lot of stool equal to 3 days stool.

133
00:22:58,318 --> 00:23:07,583
I was trying to see whether there is a possibility for a remedy.

134
00:23:15,455 --> 00:23:54,254
The first remedy I thought of was Nat-m. The second... is Carcinosin.

135
00:23:56,918 --> 00:24:00,678
You didn’t hear me asking about how obedient she is,

136
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,838
she wants to please the parents etc.?

137
00:24:06,998 --> 00:24:21,862
Also the fact that is very stressed in the report the sensitivity to criticism.

138
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:33,094
The last thought was about Sulph.

139
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:45,382
These were more or less the remedies I was thinking during the exchange.

140
00:24:49,142 --> 00:25:05,822
What shall we do now? Which of these remedies shall we give? Shall we give a remedy?

141
00:25:16,936 --> 00:25:26,422
When I ask you I really don’t know myself. Sometimes I play of course

142
00:25:27,254 --> 00:25:33,367
but sometimes it is true that I don’t know. So I am thinking while I am talking to you,

143
00:25:34,686 --> 00:25:43,247
putting things together again and again and trying to understand the organism

144
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:56,774
if it needs a push at this moment. I am always aware and afraid in conditions

145
00:25:57,198 --> 00:26:07,646
which are quite sensitive and deep that we have a quite good effect on the long run.

146
00:26:08,351 --> 00:26:16,423
By giving a wrong remedy you never know how much it can bring back problems.

147
00:26:18,174 --> 00:26:25,175
Because it can be easily overturned. A wrong prescription in such cases

148
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:33,567
may cost quite a lot of problems to the doctor and to the patient as well.

149
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:48,782
So I want to be sure when I give the remedy that Nat-m. for instance or Carc.

150
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:59,798
I want to be sure the remedy is really indicated before I give it.

151
00:27:00,694 --> 00:27:08,888
And in this case I really don’t know. I don’t see a very clear picture of a remedy.

152
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:16,742
Maybe Carc. is the best possibility but it is not confirmed.

153
00:27:17,406 --> 00:27:27,646
I did not feel that the sensitivity was such, they had to describe to me for instance

154
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:37,279
that when the father said to her go and bring me a glass of water,

155
00:27:37,854 --> 00:27:44,861
if he says it this way just because he is busy

156
00:27:45,991 --> 00:28:02,863
and he is not careful a Carc. child could be offended. It’s like you didn’t pay attention.

157
00:28:04,253 --> 00:28:10,414
You speak very harshly this is too harsh for a Carc. child.

158
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:17,526
So you hear stories, mother and father would describe this kind of sensitivity

159
00:28:18,094 --> 00:28:31,974
which is extreme. I did not see it. So you want to ask questions?

160
00:28:32,886 --> 00:28:38,886
– No question. I want to say that I wouldn’t give her a remedy

161
00:28:39,526 --> 00:28:44,518
because she told that she hasn’t a good relationship to her mother

162
00:28:45,103 --> 00:28:49,327
and she is only offended by her mother’s behavior.

163
00:28:49,767 --> 00:28:53,110
Not at school, not by the teacher, not by her friends.

164
00:28:54,686 --> 00:28:59,990
So I think the oversensitivity is not that deep to give a remedy.

165
00:29:01,382 --> 00:29:09,414
Is she taking hormones now?</br>–No.

166
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:23,798
– 1,5 year ago they stopped the hormones.</br>– I think from the second year she stopped

167
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:37,919
and for 4-5 years now she doesn’t take any hormones.

168
00:29:41,407 --> 00:29:45,274
– No, I think since 2 years she doesn’t take any hormones.

169
00:29:41,829 --> 00:29:49,181
I think it’s not so long she is free of hormones.</br>– 2-3 years she is not taking.

170
00:29:50,878 --> 00:29:54,574
This was not allowed by the government.

171
00:29:55,189 --> 00:30:02,434
You have to remember that the government has control over such cases.

172
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:05,682
And they cannot stop.

173
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:16,338
But if I remember well the agreement was to reduce the quantity from the beginning.

174
00:30:16,793 --> 00:30:20,450
– As far as I remember, last year the father said to us

175
00:30:20,898 --> 00:30:23,738
that he stopped already the hormone

176
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,850
although the doctor thought he stopped a little bit later.

177
00:30:29,458 --> 00:30:32,209
I think we had this talk last year.

178
00:30:32,674 --> 00:30:36,970
So, I think she is 2 years free of hormones and not longer.

179
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:59,218
– The question is from the beginning when you first came here

180
00:30:59,826 --> 00:31:05,138
she was taking some hormones compulsory by the professor

181
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:15,434
and if I remember well we had agreed to reduce the amount

182
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:22,467
and I would like you to tell me what happened with the amount of hormones

183
00:31:22,906 --> 00:31:27,570
and how long it took and how much of it.

184
00:31:28,482 --> 00:31:34,250
– The growing continues nearly for one year then it reduces.

185
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,522
At the beginning she grew 1 cm in one month…

186
00:31:49,402 --> 00:31:55,138
It took nearly 1 year till we went to the doctor in Vienna.

187
00:31:56,066 --> 00:31:59,057
I was forced by the government in Austria to go to the hospital

188
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:06,745
but it took nearly 1 year and in this year she grew nearly 10-12 cm.

189
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:12,194
– During the first year, before coming to Homeopathy,

190
00:32:13,994 --> 00:32:23,618
you gave the hormones and she grew…

191
00:32:27,883 --> 00:32:36,539
- Nearly one year the growing reduced when I gave her a medicine called Enantone.

192
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:41,250
– You reduced it? How much?

193
00:32:47,714 --> 00:33:05,370
– It took one year till it stopped from the beginning of the medicine.

194
00:33:07,706 --> 00:33:12,499
– He doesn’t know exactly because they made blood tests every half year

195
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,401
and according to the tests they regulated the dosage.

196
00:33:18,138 --> 00:33:20,394
So when she originally came to the treatment here

197
00:33:20,994 --> 00:33:23,314
hormones had already been reduced a little bit

198
00:33:23,858 --> 00:33:28,234
and so the first 4 years we were seeing here she was on hormones

199
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:32,594
and 2 years ago they stopped the hormones.

200
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:43,754
– They stopped the hormones because they found out that her hormones are normal now.

201
00:33:45,082 --> 00:33:52,154
– They calibrated the height of the girl. They said now she is growing

202
00:33:52,666 --> 00:33:55,250
and reduced the hormones because they hormones they give

203
00:33:55,602 --> 00:34:01,298
in order to push the growing of the child. That’s why the reduced and stopped

204
00:34:01,594 --> 00:34:04,554
because she was growing enough.

205
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:33,186
– Does anybody know the usual development of children with this problem?

206
00:34:34,426 --> 00:34:40,066
Does anybody know how long it takes with the hormones,

207
00:34:40,434 --> 00:34:43,402
what are the possible side-effects?

208
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:58,570
– There are cases where the menses come at 2-3 years.

209
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:03,882
And these girls start to develop faster than the others

210
00:35:04,874 --> 00:35:17,602
and they reach a level of height very fast comparing to the girls of the same age

211
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:24,170
and they start the treatment, the hormonal suppression

212
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:40,421
in order to not permit to the hormones to close too early the cartilages of growing.

213
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:48,865
So, they permit to the organism to reach a certain height

214
00:35:50,139 --> 00:36:03,035
and when the girls are mostly at the physiological age that the menses can start,

215
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:09,658
normally, they put out the hormonal treatment.

216
00:36:19,898 --> 00:36:30,986
– In the books you may find this syndrome and we’ll have more information about this.

217
00:36:32,114 --> 00:36:36,058
I don’t remember the details exactly.

218
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:52,322
The hormones were stopped 2 years ago, as you said,

219
00:36:54,394 --> 00:37:02,731
and the menses came 1 year before. Am I correct?

220
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:05,809
– I want to ask you something.

221
00:37:06,882 --> 00:37:11,058
When the menses have appeared in children of 2-3 years old in extreme cases,

222
00:37:11,514 --> 00:37:15,346
when they suppress the hormones the menses will go away?

223
00:37:16,811 --> 00:37:18,819
– Yes.</br>– And then they wait? How long?

224
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:23,372
If they suppressed the menses they will not come.

225
00:37:23,595 --> 00:37:32,779
– They wait until the age is close to puberty, before it.

226
00:37:33,324 --> 00:37:40,611
And then they reduce and they totally stop the hormones when the menses come

227
00:37:40,812 --> 00:37:46,500
and become regular.</br>– I asked because he said that they also take the height of the child…

228
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:59,180
- Of course. Because if we let this child without treatment they grow faster

229
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:06,900
but when they arrive at the age of puberty their cartilages close

230
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:13,972
and finally they are shorter than other girls.

231
00:38:14,364 --> 00:38:18,076
– When you say “the cartilages are closed” what are the symptoms?

232
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:28,732
– There are no symptoms, they just grow faster.</br>– Without menses?

233
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:33,300
– Without the hormonal suppression treatment.

234
00:38:40,803 --> 00:38:49,427
– I am not sure but anyhow we have to do some study about the case

235
00:38:50,404 --> 00:38:58,739
because it is not clear. My understanding was that such children are in great danger

236
00:38:59,747 --> 00:39:07,995
because they are prematurely old, because they start being women at the age of 3-4.

237
00:39:11,772 --> 00:39:19,388
The treatment which they provide is not always successful, many times has side-effects.

238
00:39:19,972 --> 00:39:33,947
Before I am sure I’ll see.</br>– You want any more comments on this?

239
00:39:34,499 --> 00:39:41,283
It’s exactly what you said; when you leave the children without treatment

240
00:39:42,453 --> 00:39:50,708
then they become prematurely old and develop breasts and pubic hair,

241
00:39:53,444 --> 00:40:00,164
so they start the hormonal treatment. Usually they measure the length

242
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:06,851
and hormones to see that they remain at a certain level.

243
00:40:08,004 --> 00:40:17,124
At the age of 10-11 in some cases but mostly a bit later they start reducing

244
00:40:17,675 --> 00:40:27,947
and they hope for the period to come. They start reducing at 10 for the breasts to grow.

245
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:41,219
There are cases where this development is delayed and in most of the cases,

246
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:48,555
as you were suspecting, there are lots of cases complaining later for menstrual problems.

247
00:40:53,524 --> 00:40:59,539
– I remember some comments of the professor he had.

248
00:41:00,748 --> 00:41:09,372
Do you remember the comments? There were some comments. We will call him back.

249
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:16,515
– What I wanted to say before in addition, she was at the age of 4-5 years

250
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:21,883
and she was very tall already in comparison to other children.

251
00:41:22,276 --> 00:41:27,812
She already pubic hair and breast.

252
00:41:29,132 --> 00:41:40,068
In case she did not take any treatment the body would be very early in certain height

253
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:47,732
and then suddenly would stop too early, like he said before.

254
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:56,012
This professor, as far as I remember, said that there was a big danger

255
00:41:56,259 --> 00:41:59,043
because she was 2-3 years old when she got the menses

256
00:41:59,852 --> 00:42:05,444
and she already had fit of rage to be dangerous in this age.

257
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:09,396
They said they must take the hormones because of all these

258
00:42:10,116 --> 00:42:14,036
and the anger was suppressed by taking these hormones

259
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:20,244
because she was a little child having red head and exploding from anger.

260
00:42:22,043 --> 00:42:23,947
You remember I think it was 2 years ago

261
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,763
she destroyed a glass door from made of safety glass.

262
00:42:39,812 --> 00:42:44,379
When they stopped the hormones 2 years ago the anger increased

263
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:53,212
and this was the year when you gave her Stram. And since then the anger is normal.

264
00:42:56,196 --> 00:43:07,676
– Anyhow, in this case I believe that the development has gone very well

265
00:43:10,523 --> 00:43:17,675
and that is why at this moment I will refrain giving any remedy.

266
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:27,587
I don’t want her to take any remedy at this moment. The last remedy was Puls.

267
00:43:28,812 --> 00:43:35,476
She has taken Stram. before Puls. and Phos. was before.

268
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:48,388
I have to study more about that syndrome so I know more things

269
00:43:48,899 --> 00:43:53,251
and I can give you information. You can do the same.

270
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:58,805
– George, I think we are on the right track because the father really confirmed me

271
00:44:00,259 --> 00:44:07,699
that she is really normal in every part of life. So for her father there really is no problem,

272
00:44:08,684 --> 00:44:14,939
they came just to be sure that everything is going in the right way because it was severe.

273
00:44:15,532 --> 00:44:20,060
– In order to understand the development you have to see the case since 7 years ago

274
00:44:20,611 --> 00:44:28,939
when she was a very child, she was behaving like a woman, she was having sexual desire,

275
00:44:29,444 --> 00:44:37,340
she was flirting with men etc. She is more or less normal, now.

276
00:44:37,764 --> 00:44:44,828
When I asked her you like somebody she says yes I like but this is absolutely normal.

277
00:44:45,347 --> 00:44:56,668
It’s not something out of proportion. In any case this is what we can do. So far so good.
