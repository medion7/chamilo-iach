1
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:27,690
-So the boy is 13 years old and the problem is...

2
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:38,940
-The problem is that since 1 year old he has a daily sort of vomiting. Even more.

3
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,690
-A specific time?
-No.

4
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:55,190
It can be any time. It can be in the morning, noon, afternoon, in the evening.

5
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,840
-Why does he think he has this vomiting?

6
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:08,770
-The problem started in the beginning of 97, about 2 years ago.

7
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:24,430
The problem was that Johannes got teased in his school and mainly because of his

8
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:37,930
height. Because he was too short. And that's how a big grief started and

9
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:46,030
in the midst of 97 he changed school and he went to high school.

10
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,180
On this school he was about the smallest of all pupils in this school and there too

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:05,170
he got teased. It wasn't that bad in the old school, it got much worse in the new school.

12
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,670
It was not his own class that would tease him, it was more the other pupils in the school

13
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,180
that would tease on him.

14
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,300
It was not that bad in the old school but when he was in the new school,

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,890
it was really bad.

16
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:34,050
Then a sort of continuous vomiting started. The normal examination didn't show any

17
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:44,790
results and so we went to an endocrinologist and in Autumn 97 this doctor found out

18
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:51,390
that the function of the thyroid gland is diminished, not enough.

19
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,900
It' not enough the T3, the T4 level was OK.

20
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:17,650
And I found out that this malfunctioning of the thyroid was caused by the hypophysis

21
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,400
and I gave him some homeopathic remedies.

22
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,910
-What remedies he took?

23
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:38,310
-Silica C200 and C1000 but there was no result. So I went to a homeopath in Berlin and

24
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,140
shortly before we went Johannes told me for the first time about this grief.

25
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,160
Before he kept all this grief inside himself. I saw that he was having something that

26
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,890
was troubling him but I didn't know what it was. It was visible but I didn't know

27
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:03,740
what it was and this homeopath gave him in the 20th of October 97, a Nat. mur. 1M.

28
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,470
I realized right before we got there that it should be Nat. mur. but it was not me but

29
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,500
finally the homeopath that gave it to him.

30
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:24,520
Within 3 weeks the function of the thyroid gland was OK again, it was normal and the

31
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:34,020
endocrinologist before had to give him tablets with thyroid hormone, a substitute and

32
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,510
I stopped these tablets afterwards. Then I asked the endocrinologist why he thought

33
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,750
that it got in order again because the second examination showed that everything was

34
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:53,200
normal again and I knew that the endocrinologist was an enemy towards Homeopathy.

35
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,280
He said, the first results we took must have been wrong, must have been a mistake.

36
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,110
-Always it's a mistake.

37
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,340
-The thyroid gland got in order again and took the grief that was pressing the soul

38
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,830
and getting better. Since this very moment the situation is as following.

39
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:29,180
He is vomiting 46 times every day and the vomiting is as followed.

40
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,590
He sits at the table, he gets up from the table, goes into the kitchen to the dustbin

41
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:44,340
and open it and throws up and what comes out is water and some indigested food

42
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:51,930
and then he goes away and it's finished. It's an action of 7-8 sec.

43
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,340
-He is not having nausea before, it comes suddenly?

44
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:17,370
-It comes all out of a sudden.
-He has to say something else?

45
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:28,370
-I have a slight headache but it's constantly.

46
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,370
-Where?
-In the front region. All over.

47
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:40,620
-All over the head or all over the forehead.

48
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:49,620
-Just the forehead. Very strong or mild?

49
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,440
-Not very strong. This headache is constantly there but it doesn't impede him

50
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,700
from doing what he wants to do in school or playing football.

51
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,690
-How is he doing in his school?

52
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:09,190
-Very good, in school last time he had a very good average of grades.

53
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,690
-Very good means within the first 5th of his class?

54
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:22,790
-The second best and he is excellent in mathematics.

55
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:37,450
-Every time that they speak about this subject he cries?

56
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:45,190
-Often. In his class he is well accepted, it's just when he goes to the toilet, the other

57
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,800
kids tease him and fool him.

58
00:07:53,310 --> 00:08:05,440
-If in the family they speak about this, he starts crying there also, outside of the school

59
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,050
like now I see he is crying every time he thinks about it.

60
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,280
This is only specially here at this moment or it happens in the house also?

61
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,530
-In the school the tears don't come, he won't cry at school.

62
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:29,130
Just when I see homeopaths or other doctors the tears come.

63
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:40,370
-Is he a child that needs affection, ask the father.

64
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:47,290
-He wants attention, not that he needs direct consolation but he would need attention.

65
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:03,190
-Is anything else from his medical history?

66
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,140
-Besides this he has strong constipation but that doesn't seem to bother him very much.

67
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:25,110
Concerning his emotional state of affairs, he is at the moment a little bit under shock

68
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,950
because just an hour ago he rent together with his father and got a blow in the nose.

69
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,630
After this Nat. mur. in October 97, six weeks later, I went to this homeopath again

70
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:54,430
because this vomiting was still there and then he told me to give C12 of Nat. mur. daily.

71
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,820
And we did but there was no result.

72
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,440
On the 1st of February in 98, we saw this homeopath again and I had the impression she

73
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,600
didn't quite know what to do about his case either and then she finally said give him

74
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:17,950
Nat. arsenicum in C200. He is freezing a lot and often he has icy cold hands.

75
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:25,600
Over all he is more at the freezing side but especially the hands are very cold.

76
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:32,840
Then we didn't see this homeopath anymore and then my story of lacking successes

77
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,940
in treating my son started.

78
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:49,840
In 98 I gave him because of the constant headache Ferrum metallicum C12, no result.

79
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,370
Then on the 23 of March I gave him, because of this severe constipation, where

80
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:02,630
sometimes he really had to get out the stool by hands, I gave him Nux vomica in C12

81
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,010
no effect. Then I consulted a homeopath from Berlin and she said it could be

82
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:14,760
Medorrhinum because he is biting his nails and he had a small wart on his thigh.

83
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,190
But there was no effect in Medorrhinum C 1M.

84
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,880
I was quite desperate because he was vomiting every day, with every meal we took

85
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,690
he would vomit.

86
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:31,830
In April I gave him Rhus tox because of his restlessness.

87
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:41,340
He is very restless and when he sits at the table eating his meal, he would kick with

88
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,090
his feet all the time, like playing football. The restlessness is mainly concentrated

89
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,840
on the lower part of his body, he will sit in his chair but immediately after eating

90
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,870
he will get up and walk about in the room. To finish the story, there was no effect of

91
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,120
Rhus tox either.

92
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:09,380
Then I thought of Ignatia, in April Ignatia C200, no effect and in May 98, Arsenicum

93
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,440
album in C200 and 1M, no effect.

94
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:25,000
Then we had the seminar in May here, in Alonissos, and then you told children remedies

95
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:31,260
and with vomiting in children you mentioned the remedy Ipecacuanha and then I tried

96
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:41,600
Ipecacuanha C200, no success and the last remedy in June was Lycopodium, no effect.

97
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:51,250
-So he is restless while sitting and after eating he becomes restless?

98
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,250
-When I come home from the seminar for example, he won't sit and read or lie on his

99
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,750
bed but he would stand and having a racket on his hand and play with the ball with the

100
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:07,350
squash racket and play the ball against the wall, all the time in movement.

101
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,100
And a restlessness, especially in his legs.

102
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,500
-What he likes best to eat?

103
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,310
-It varies. For 2 weeks I like this, for 2 weeks I like that, it changes.

104
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,570
-He likes ice-cream?

105
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,580
- I do like it but I wouldn't say more than other kids.

106
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,230
-You have an objection?

107
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,770
-I would say that he really likes it very much.

108
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:41,360
-The friends of mine eat ice-cream daily, I eat ice-cream every 2 weeks.

109
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,870
Not in winter of course, just in summer time.

110
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:56,650
-His thirst is normal?
-He is very thirsty.

111
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,860
-For cold water?

112
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,270
-If it's with bubbles, I like it in room temperature, if it's without bubbles like here

113
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,870
in Greece, I do like it icy cold.

114
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,020
-Does he like also ice cubes to eat?
-No.

115
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,120
-How much salt he puts to his food?
-Not much.

116
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,970
-I would like to make some comments generally on his nutrition.

117
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,950
This got less now but about 1 and 1/2 year ago he would control all what he was eating

118
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:47,930
exactly concerning the content of fat. He would take the things he would eat and control

119
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,650
the content of fat, how much fat.

120
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,110
-What does he mean by that?

121
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:59,110
-When we went down in the super market for shopping, he would take all the different

122
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:04,100
cheeses and look on what they write on them, how much fat do they contain and

123
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,860
if it was more than 1%, he would say not this cheese I can't take, it's too fatty.

124
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,400
Because he says, my experience is when it's too much fat in it, I would vomit more.

125
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:26,530
- He is very correct. He used to eat fat before?
-Yes.

126
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,030
-He liked fat?
-Not especially.

127
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,450
-Butter?
-Yes.

128
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,460
-Even now he takes butter?
-No.

129
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,050
-Because he is afraid he may vomit more easily?
-Yes.

130
00:15:53,290 --> 00:16:00,300
-There is in his medical history, there is any serious acute condition?

131
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:13,170
-Every now and then he got an otitis and they had to put little tubes in it.

132
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:23,280
That was the only thing. I remark two things. When we came to Greece, we saw a lot

133
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:33,530
of badly fed cats and he takes a little pot with milk and carries it outside and

134
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,530
wants that the cat will eat it or when we eat pizza, he will take a piece of the pizza

135
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:45,040
and give it to the cats, he has a lot of compassion with the cats.

136
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:51,880
-Only with the cats or with every animal?
-Yes, too.

137
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,090
-He has frequent nose bleeding?

138
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,890
-Recently not that much anymore but formally before he would have it quite often.

139
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:05,240
Normally before 1 year he would have it once the week from the right nostril.

140
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:15,640
Always right. And if I hurt myself and gets nose bleeding, it's always on the right side.

141
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:27,900
And when he got this stroke on his nose right now, he got strong nose bleeding

142
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,130
just out of his right nostril and it was brightly red and at the end there was a clot

143
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,820
coming out.

144
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:47,070
-The vomiting is like a rocket?
-Yes. Very sudden.

145
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,970
-He is talking about philosophical matters, asking questions?

146
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,710
-Not that much about philosophy but he likes to talk and he has an excellent memory

147
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:08,940
especially for prices. From about 5-6 super markets in Berlin, he would know exactly

148
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,050
the prices of about 20 different items.

149
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,040
-He is biting his nails for a long time?
-Yes.

150
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,480
-Is he shy?

151
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,310
-Not at home that much but at the school I would say yes.

152
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:46,780
With strangers he would be reserved.

153
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:52,780
But in the school where they don't know me, I think I'm shy.

154
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,350
-He is very thirsty.

155
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:07,700
-Yes, he drinks more than 2 lt and when he drinks he takes big sips, a lot at the time.

156
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,440
-Does he have any fears?

157
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,710
-Fear of thunderstorms?
-No.

158
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,620
-Fear in the dark?
-No.

159
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:25,770
-With his class he can answer questions, if the teacher asks a question?

160
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:31,260
If he knows the answer, he will put up his hand.

161
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,450
-In the class yes, no problem.

162
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,850
-He is still constipated?

163
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,440
-Yes and sometimes during and after stool he has a prolapse of the anus.

164
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,340
-Ask him in how many times he wants to stop vomiting?

165
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,450
-Today!

166
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,450
-Does he like salt?

167
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,340
-He used to like chips but not so much anymore, I can't really tell because my

168
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,940
sister takes extremely much salt. So I wouldn't know.

169
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,840
Sometimes he likes to eat chocolate but not very often.

170
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:36,080
-What about lemon?
-Yes, not extremely but with the tea.

171
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,470
Concerning his intellectual development he is very far ahead.

172
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,980
But concerning his physical development he is back, he is a bit retarded and he is

173
00:20:53,080 --> 00:21:07,570
suffering, his height is 1m 42 cm and the others are sometimes very much taller.

174
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:18,220
-When we see him in 6 months, how many cm he wants to be higher?

175
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,470
-I would really like to be 20 cm higher than now, I know this is not possible but

176
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,330
I would really like it.

177
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,580
-20 cm is rather difficult.

178
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:39,800
-Some colleagues in my class are 1m 85 cm.

179
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:49,410
-My god. The German race is coming taller and taller.

180
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:59,240
OK, we decide in the class now.

181
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:38,830
With the right remedy how long it will take for the boy to stop vomiting?

182
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,620
Who can predict?

183
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,680
-One day.
-Tonight.

184
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:08,750
-This is interesting because I thought in the beginning that's the remedy.

185
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:18,000
Until the end, where I said, maybe I'm wrong.

186
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:32,070
Give the symptoms that you put in the Repertory so that you will get an idea what

187
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,630
are the symptoms that you use.

188
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:13,970
Vomiting, ailments from grief, dwarfishness, nausea after mortification, ailments from

189
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:25,480
mortification, sudden vomiting...

190
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:45,630
You put too many times grief, mortification.

191
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,510
Nausea after mortification make it 3 times.

192
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,060
-On this rubric there is no remedy.

193
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,810
-There is no 3 times remedy?

194
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:18,970
Vomiting sudden, constant pain in forehead...

195
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,980
Constant vomiting make it three times.

196
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:41,630
-Sudden vomiting while eating is a small rubric because he is eating and he is

197
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:46,980
standing up, goes and has a sudden vomiting, this is a small rubric.

198
00:25:48,930 --> 00:26:00,800
-He said that it can be anytime. Is it during eating only, it is during eating

199
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,650
most of the time or it is anytime?

200
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:15,310
-Maybe 60% it is during or after eating but the 40% is on another time.

201
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:36,420
-A nice child who is sitting in front of you and cries in a such a nice way,

202
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,490
as this boy.

203
00:26:42,990 --> 00:27:09,060
When he hears about the problem, it is a case of Pulsatilla, especially when it says

204
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:21,240
I try not to eat fat because fat will make me sick, will make me vomit.

205
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:30,470
This combination is a Pulsatilla combination only.

206
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,720
Put the columns.

207
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:06,120
All the time I was thinking of Pulsatilla, Pulsatilla, Pulsatilla.

208
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,620
Then the thirst came, thirsty, thirsty, thirsty, very thirsty.

209
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:23,800
Then came the idea of coldness, freezing.

210
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:38,300
Then I started thinking maybe I'm making a mistake thinking of Pulsatilla.

211
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:57,280
So Veratrum, Silica, Sepia, Pulsatilla. Show me Pulsatilla how many symptoms covers

212
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:02,380
of this boy? 10 out of 19.

213
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:11,050
Show me Veratrum, 13 out of 19.

214
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:31,300
So the choice for this remedy should be between Pulsatilla and Veratrum album.

215
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:43,800
Why Veratrum album? Because of restlessness.

216
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,420
Restlessness after eating, show me this.

217
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,790
-It already starts after eating, at the very beginning, maybe already after 1-2 min.

218
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:32,280
after he starts eating at the table, he gets up, dances around, plays around with

219
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,640
the ball in between he vomits briefly, then he sits down again.

220
00:30:52,300 --> 00:31:09,200
-What is interesting here is that the boy is vomiting suddenly and like a rocket.

221
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:24,620
This reminds of the vomiting of Veratrum album but there is one symptom which made

222
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,460
me actually go to Veratrum, which is this symptom?

223
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:42,630
There is a symptom, if you have studied you would have found it.

224
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:51,190
Which is the symptom which finally made me jump from Pulsatilla, I was certain even

225
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:56,440
when he said he is freezing I was still Pulsatilla, when he said thirsty

226
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,690
I said still Pulsatilla.

227
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:05,940
But when I saw that symptom finally, I said forget Pulsatilla or we have it as a second

228
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:13,940
possibility, the first possibility should be Veratrum. Which is the symptom?

229
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:22,800
A symptom which is clear cut and which is clear cut also in the Repertory.

230
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:30,370
Epistaxis on the right side. Show me epistaxis on the right side.

231
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:43,520
This was a clear symptom, always in the right. I say my god and then I'm thinking of

232
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:49,870
Veratrum album and then I saw this and said that's it.

233
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:00,610
The problem is that I don't want to give first Veratrum and then Pulsatilla and then

234
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:06,200
take 24 hours before we cure the child. The child must be cured tonight.

235
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:19,460
Because he said I want to be cured tonight. I don't want to vomit again.

236
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:33,340
We said about Veratrum, if you remember, is a boy who is advanced in mental level

237
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:43,340
and very clever but has been retarded, mostly in emotional level.

238
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:52,290
Emotionally is not mature. For instance this type of children who become first in their

239
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:57,250
class, you remember we described they are first in their class, they even can go to

240
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:03,500
special schools because they are so intelligent, they put questions, before you ask

241
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,770
the question, they know the answer etc. Yet these children, where you expect that at

242
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:20,210
the age of 13 the boy is starting to get interested in girls and emotionally becoming

243
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:25,920
involved in that kind of thing, you don't see it in Veratrum.

244
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:41,170
You see they are totally disinterested in this area. There is one side a hyper development

245
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:54,670
and on the other side lack of development, which here maybe goes together with under

246
00:34:54,770 --> 00:35:01,360
development of the physical body. At the same time we see restlessness.

247
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:13,360
The children are very restless, they will not sit, they will get up but usually

248
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:21,110
I have seen a desire for salt, which I could not get it.

249
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:32,700
Maybe his sister is Nat. mur.

250
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:09,100
In Veratrum album we have vomiting after vexation, exactly the symptom we're

251
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,200
looking for. for. You see it?

252
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:26,200
Vomiting after vexation is Veratrum and Chamomilla. Two main remedies.

253
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,350
I like that symptom. Where did you find it?

254
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:34,450
-I put vomiting in Veratrum.

255
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,710
-I like it.

256
00:36:45,700 --> 00:37:14,450
What potency? I would like to hear about the potency. 200, 1M, 10M, 50M, CM?

257
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:35,510
-OK, 50M, why? Because this is a deep mortification, a deep grief, a deep trauma on

258
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:47,270
a very deep emotional level. Therefore we need a high potency to counteract it.

259
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:59,770
So tonight you get a 50M Veratrum album and tomorrow we have a consultation.

260
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:15,630
We'll have a consultation before you leave, because we have 10 days for observation

261
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:23,210
and we hope, because many time you think the remedy is absolutely right and you get

262
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:31,310
no effect, we'll see.

263
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:01,090
-I had reported 3 days ago that from 22 September on, meaning from the day where he

264
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:08,330
received Veratrum album in XC, the frequency of these very short vomiting attacks

265
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:14,830
got higher, they were more attacks per day. They were 1-2 days where he vomited

266
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:20,430
6-7 times but yesterday it was 10 times again.

267
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:29,910
And I don't know how much it has been this morning, up to now. 4 times up to now.

268
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:35,660
The attacks are not bad, they don't incapacitate him in any way,  that's very remarkable,

269
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,910
he can immediately afterwards continue doing his sports or study something.

270
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:45,910
It doesn't seem to influence him in any way and he has no nausea with it.

271
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:54,760
-The attacks are different in any way or the form is exactly the same?

272
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:05,410
That means there is less force, less quantity, because to vomit 10 times that means

273
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:07,760
nothing is staying inside.

274
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,660
-I was not able to watch it because he usually has these attacks when

275
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,260
I'm attending the seminar.

276
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,760
-He says no change.

277
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:33,670
-I remember when you described the case the child was quiet, restless, especially while

278
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:38,430
eating, after eating, how is that?

279
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:46,180
-I would say the restlessness has ameliorated by about 20%.

280
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,080
-Constipation, how is it?

281
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:03,570
-Before the remedy he had stool every second day, meaning every second day he could

282
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:12,430
not go to the toilet and within the last 5 days, once he had stool on 3 successing days.

283
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:20,830
That was a bit remarkable. I saw the stool are usually dark brown and not very formed

284
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,630
more like a paste.

285
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:29,860
And what I noticed is that he is very compassionate with the animals, very sympathetic.

286
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,110
He feeds them every night, he takes plates, he feeds them with milk, he puts that out to

287
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:39,820
the cats, he keeps asking us if we still have anything left in the refrigerator, cheese or

288
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,260
something that he could still feed them.

289
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:49,910
-This, in Germany as well?
-No.

290
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:54,410
We do have a cat at home, he also takes care of it but what he does here is really

291
00:41:54,510 --> 00:42:04,910
remarkable. But it's possible since his friends are not here and he does not have so

292
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:08,760
much distraction that he tends to care more of the animals.

293
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:44,750
-Last time when we analyzed his case, we were battling between Veratrum and Pulsatilla.

294
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,750
He takes milk?

295
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,260
-I don't take that much milk, no.

296
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:08,500
-Ice-cream?
-Not that much, I would say average.

297
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:17,750
-How is the restlessness of the feet?

298
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,250
-I, myself can not judge it very well I think.

299
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:37,750
-Nose epistaxis right happened once?
-No.

300
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:45,250
-Cold water desire still is there? His thirst is increased?

301
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:53,250
-But not especially for cold water. It can be normal temperature.

302
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,650
-One thing I noticed, we rented a bicycle for him while we are here and last night

303
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:06,650
the chain popped out and he was angry and I tried to fix it. We went in the room and he

304
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:14,170
was so angry that suddenly kicked the chair and he was shouting angrily, loudly.

305
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:24,010
-He never did this before?
-No, he does it sometimes.

306
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:37,490
-This pain in the forehead, hands icy cold how is that?

307
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:46,650
-Now definitely are not cold but of course in Greece is a lot warmer than in Germany.

308
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:51,400
So I don't know how it will be when we get back home. He never got icy cold hands

309
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:58,250
during summertime, it was always in winter or spring, fall times.

310
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,750
-How is his mood in general? The same?

311
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:47,750
You will pay for that. It's very good. You do whatever you like.

312
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:28,830
Don't bother about anybody. Don't translate what I'm going to say now.

313
00:46:49,560 --> 00:47:00,380
He will know everything but what I want to ask is if he drinks milk, if he drinks

314
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,320
he wants the milk to be cold?

315
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:12,230
-There is an intolerance of fat and so he doesn't drink normal milk because the fat

316
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,570
content is too high.

317
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:26,160
-Show me the rubric, fat aggravates.

318
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:43,800
I want to ask him if he remembers by the time his class mates, if he remembers

319
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:51,150
something specific that they said, somebody said this or said that?

320
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:56,400
-It was not my class mates who tease me, not them. It was just some others

321
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,930
I didn't know who were from the same school, for example when we were in the toilet

322
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:03,740
and they tease me that I was too small.

323
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,580
-Is that what he hurt you?
-Yes.

324
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:22,980
-And he is putting a lot of effort into trying to please me, he is so considered,

325
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,220
he keeps asking, is anything you would like? What about this strawberry yogurt,

326
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:31,480
I think you might like to eat it. Can I buy you something father?

327
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:39,480
Or do you want something that I could still get it for you? Very strong.

328
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:43,000
He always ask, can I help you in any way?

329
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:50,220
-Right now is a period where I found many things boring on this island,

330
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,080
there is not that much to do really.

331
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,720
-He does this only here?

332
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:59,410
-No, he does it also at home.

333
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:07,830
-Show me this rubric, wants to please others.

334
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:22,740
The desire for salt, how much is it?

335
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:38,150
-Middle, normal. He says he has not the impression to be spotted on the island

336
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,990
but he is still vomiting.

337
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:53,990
-It's even more. It's clearly more. 80% more.

338
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:01,400
-The vomiting has anything to do with the drinking of cold water?

339
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:09,980
When you drink cold, is it that comes up after a period of time or immediately or has

340
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,910
nothing to do with the drinking of cold water?

341
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:22,660
-I didn't notice it up to now.

342
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:34,560
-Vomiting comes independent of eating, it can come before eating also?

343
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:41,160
-About 50% of the vomiting is in relation with eating, the other 50% is not.

344
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,860
-Thank you.

345
00:50:46,710 --> 00:51:00,460
This was a good possibility that we have to reexamine the case. What do you think?

346
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:16,700
This is definitely an aggravation, I would say already it's 10 days.

347
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:51,090
For that, what he has, it's a long aggravation already but the question is there is any

348
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:57,030
amelioration, in any level? This is the question.

349
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,780
The answer is no. Who says no?

350
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:25,040
There is amelioration. Where is the amelioration?

351
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,700
-He didn't weep anymore when you talked to him about his humiliation.

352
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:41,130
-I said don't translate what I'm going to do but then I asked some other questions

353
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:49,100
and what I wanted to see is the emotional condition of the boy but he should not know

354
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,680
that I was checking on him.

355
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:57,430
So I asked him about the milk, about hot, cold and then I brought the subject into the

356
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:08,780
heart of the matter. What they said about you? This was recalled.

357
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:17,430
No cry. Did you see the deep crying on the first time?

358
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:26,860
Do you think that because it's 10 days later he will not cry? Of course. He's crying for

359
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:33,420
the last 5 years, is he going to stop now?

360
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:45,080
-We had about 4-5 history taking in Berlin, after he had been vexated.

361
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:50,000
The time that he hit the topic of this vexation, the tears came.

362
00:53:55,170 --> 00:54:04,320
-Here you have an aggravation on the physical level, then you have to know whether

363
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:11,720
this aggravation is because of a mental-emotional amelioration.

364
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:17,580
This is very important, otherwise you go wrong.

365
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:32,030
And this child emotionally is already much better, even when his father did all this and

366
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:41,640
he was embarrassed, he still managed to say, you're wrong and he managed to ...

367
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:51,150
His defenses on that level were very correct. How he responded to his father.

368
00:54:51,250 --> 00:55:00,560
So it is the opposite of what it was said. His shyness is much less, there is no way that

369
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:08,920
a Baryta carbonica child would sit here and even talk, would even open his mouth.

370
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:19,060
You ask him and would look and he wants to hide, there is nothing to do with

371
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:24,390
Baryta carbonica. Dwarfishness is not the idea.

372
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:37,070
I have seen this in Sulphur, children develop from some problems in hypophysis they

373
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:44,170
don't develop and then Sulphur, you see them next year, they have 20 cm.

374
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:58,600
It's not always Baryta, a child Baryta will never do this, will be able to face the class

375
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:07,920
to answer questions in such presence of mind. No timidity, whatsoever.

376
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:21,230
And when you bring the subject which is very painful all the time, this time is not.

377
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:35,840
With the physical aggravation, you say wait. That is where the whole class has gone wrong.

378
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:57,740
What I can see is that this emotional problem has brought about some very deep

379
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:04,650
changes in the physical body, which will take time to be corrected, it's not just a

380
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,500
functional thing, it's much more than that.

381
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:15,240
Therefore we have to be very patient and wait and I will give you an estimation.

382
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:27,170
What I think is that in 3 months his vomiting will almost be gone.

383
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:46,060
So we wait, though I would have liked even a higher potency, a stronger but still

384
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:54,890
now it is OK for me because definitely there is the aggravation at the physical level

385
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:59,490
but at the same time an emotional amelioration.

386
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:07,640
This deep trauma is not anymore here, it is somewhere in the kidneys or in the stomach

387
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:09,240
or whatever.

388
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:19,390
-Considering that you wanted to give him a 50M in the beginning and you didn't have it

389
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:23,990
but now with this aggravation in the physical level, there is no possibility to give him

390
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,970
the higher potency of Veratrum?

391
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:36,730
-I don't want to, now. I see this amelioration which is very apparent for me.

392
00:58:36,830 --> 00:58:39,980
Otherwise you would have seen the child in front of the class?

393
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:45,970
We say he knows the class. Who knows the class? He was in the room crying.

394
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:51,470
He comes in the class and still is on that state, he would be teared into pieces.

395
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:59,980
What I did was a little dangerous because you could see the child crying and then you

396
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,820
would say, why did you ask him this question.

397
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:09,220
But I had to do it in order to decide. It's very important for the life of this child,

398
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:17,060
for me to understand what has taken place. It's much more important, it may be cruel

399
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:22,310
to ask again the same question but at the same time I want to be sure that

400
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:31,060
my evaluation is correct. Because everybody would say, give another remedy,

401
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,310
give Pulsatilla, give Phosphorus.

402
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:42,310
Phosphorus and Pulsatilla is a possibility for later on, we'll see how it develops

403
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:57,720
but the intolerance to fat and milk show that the digestive system is at fault

404
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:02,560
for the time being, we'll see how it will develop.

405
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:19,820
It's a very good case this one for you to be more careful in your evaluation.
