1
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:37,330
The father was out of control completely. The child, 4 years old, the same night urination.

2
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,420
Since I had seen the scene I gave Aconite.

3
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:49,220
It took me 6 months before I understood that that was much deeper situation.

4
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,710
Because with Aconite a few days better and then worse and then again Aconite.

5
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:00,800
You know this story, better, better and then back again.

6
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:11,880
Then after 6 months you say that case is quite serious. Then I went to see the family.

7
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,990
This one, I'm talking about, was one of those who attacked me.

8
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:29,070
He was strong, he hits me. Then immediately comes another picture.

9
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:38,560
The parents, what a sweet child. They forget that sometimes it breaks the head of some fellow.

10
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:47,590
What about he broke 3 heads already? Oh, that was an accident, the child is sweet.

11
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:53,710
Until I saw the child. Is he behaving like this? Yes, many times we don't understand why.

12
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:08,810
The aggression that comes up. Aconite does not have this aggression but you don't know.

13
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:15,210
Like you give Arnica, it falls down you give Arnica and many times it's not Arnica,

14
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,140
it's not working, it's Sulphuric acid, much more difficult to find.

15
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,350
Are you interested in this?

16
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:42,810
Because we try to satisfy the pediatricians a little bit but you also can see children. Be patient.

17
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,260
-He is more attached to you, than his father?
-Yes.

18
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:57,850
He is afraid of his father, he loses every control and then he stutters and...

19
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,990
He starts.

20
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,730
He just wanted to bite his mother.

21
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,730
-Do you like your mother to hit you?
-Yes.

22
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,980
-Your mother also hits you?
-Yes.

23
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,490
-Would you like that?
-Yes.

24
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:27,470
-If your mother hits you, you like it?
-He likes it but I don't.

25
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,140
-You never hit him.

26
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,290
It is coming.

27
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,820
-What does he say?

28
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,040
-Come and take the bread.

29
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:55,970
-Your bread is eaten by the cat. You take another bread.

30
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,860
Sit down there.

31
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,700
This is very difficult to show the aggression of Stramonium

32
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,110
because you will have to catch a child during crisis and that I don't know

33
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:58,070
if I will ever be able to do it, so you can see clearly what it happens but it's frightful.

34
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,460
You see that there is no logic, logic is gone.

35
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:21,340
The child is hitting, is biting, is afraid of the dark, is afraid of deep water,

36
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:40,360
he is sweet, affectionate and that's a Stramonium child. Typical Stramonium child.

37
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:56,490
Whatever is a surface which you can not see the depth, you can not see through,

38
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:06,490
it's a kind of surface but black, what reminds the individual, it reminds him of some

39
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,730
of the subconscious, the darkness in the subconscious.

40
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:25,990
There is a sense of something dark overtaking them, something which has no control,

41
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:35,490
it is not clear, they can not describe it and say, this anger overtook me and then I did it.

42
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:43,490
That lake reminds them or that subconscious, whatever brings in their mind

43
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:54,740
the anger of the subconscious. The Stramonium has an anger which has stayed inside.

44
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:02,490
When they see that depicted in any picture outside, that brings up a correspondence,

45
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:12,900
bring up a kind of reaction like they will have a reaction,

46
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:24,500
they will be terrified if they see a dog barking. This is what is inside, it's the same thing.

47
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:31,750
That reminds me of something terrible has happened here. The subconscious is coming,

48
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,100
the fear is coming now.

49
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,480
That fear is inside. We project. What do you think we do?

50
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,730
All the time we project the fears.

51
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:50,860
You enter the room and you hear a noise and you saw the robber already, he is there and he is gone.

52
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,470
It was my imagination.

53
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:05,540
Stramonium also is afraid of water per se.

54
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:13,020
That means if water comes over them, take these children and put them on shower,

55
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:21,790
not all the Stramonium but many, they can not breathe, it seems that a film is falling,

56
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:31,200
they feel that they can not breathe and will go into fits, they jump out of the water, they can not.

57
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:42,380
They are terrified, fear of water, fear of shiny. That's why they break the glasses mostly.

58
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:47,780
Stramonium is one of the remedies that breaks glasses mostly.

59
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,030
When you have a mad person in the house, they know and they have covered all the glasses,

60
00:10:54,130 --> 00:11:01,790
all the mirrors. The person Stramonium will break them when it comes to a fit.

61
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,290
Fear of being injured?

62
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:23,440
They can yes. I can't remember now whether I have seen it but it doesn't matter

63
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,530
 whether I remember it or not. They may have a fear, tremendous fear that they can be injured.

64
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:38,190
Very pathological fear that anything can injure them, that they may have an accident,

65
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,790
you may hit them, you may touch them.

66
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:54,770
That's not as simple as that. It might be a Stramonium.

67
00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:01,020
It has to be a Stramonium case before it's helped. The Stramonium first of all

68
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:10,020
they will not be able to go into waters which are not clear, which they don't see the bottom,

69
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,890
they can not do it, they will avoid it.

70
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,020
If they can see it is clear, there is no so much fear,

71
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:32,300
the fear is when they see from outside a lake, a well. You know the well is always dark.

72
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,130
That is causing fear. You must get the idea.

73
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,370
They are mischievous.

74
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:07,200
These children have certain characteristics like fear of the dark, fear of in general

75
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:22,700
and the most is that Tuberculinum is not so aggressive, so violent as Stramonium.

76
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,430
Tuberculinum will break things, Stramonium also will break things

77
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:34,440
but Tuberculinum will break things, something he didn't like.

78
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,940
If you have a Tuberculinum child and you have this kind of dress that you like,

79
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:47,450
they will go and cut it because you like it and they can do things like that

80
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:55,040
which is more under control and more devious.

81
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,780
What you have to remember to these children, they are all very taken by a subconscious,

82
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,620
which is full of anger and full of irritability but overtaken, it's a state.

83
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:26,870
-What about Belladonna type children?
-I don't know.

84
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:51,120
Belladonna is different all together. The violence of Belladonna is...

85
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:23,790
First of all it will be very difficult to find Belladonna constitutional child with violence.

86
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:33,760
What you see in Belladonna mostly is violence during high fever, instead of having convulsions,

87
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,860
we see the violence of Belladonna.

88
00:15:49,620 --> 00:16:00,680
Stramonium is indicated in all kinds of fevers from pneumonias and bronchitis to

89
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:09,950
meningitis, meningoencephalitis, to typhus.

90
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:26,620
Typhus, you can not see very much typhus. Has anybody seen typhus? You have seen.

91
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:30,110
-In hospital.
-Yes.

92
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,360
-Not very severe.

93
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,630
-So some of them can go to Stramonium cases where they really become violent,

94
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:47,030
they shout, they cry, they have convulsions.

95
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:55,850
That is where you see Belladonna mostly and you see the violence of Belladonna

96
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:07,160
where they might bite others, they get up from bed, they are in a state mostly of delusions,

97
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:18,830
delusional state where they seem to fight with imaginary phantoms.

98
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:26,150
Many times they have this peculiarity, they go and try to climb a wall.

99
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,410
They go here and they will try to climb, it's an aggressive thing to see.

100
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:39,240
I have seen it once and it's quite aggressive because it's fighting to climb this wall,

101
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:46,100
scratching with, putting his feet up.

102
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:13,510
-He curses but not very often.

103
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,910
-With grown ups also?

104
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:31,490
-Yes, shut up, go away and say very bad words.

105
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:42,590
-He hits grown ups and he tells bad words, he curses. What else he will do?

106
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,340
-Does he talk a lot?
-Very much.

107
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,000
-Loquacity, talks a lot.
-He can talk the whole day.

108
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:02,490
-It's also another thing that I noticed, I don't remember if this child has it

109
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:07,250
is that they are sexually very aware.

110
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:18,500
You will see this child pinching women, pinching the buttock of a woman, grasp her breast,

111
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,930
it's quite aggressive and quite overtly. They are not shy.

112
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:34,330
And I have seen in another child, he was sitting in the consultation room with his brother.

113
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:40,070
He was pinching his brother bottom and his father says, what are you doing there?

114
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:58,330
I'm pinching his bottom, he says which premature sexual awareness, quite strongly.

115
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,570
Some they recognize themselves when they were young.

116
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:21,570
Don't go and take Stramonium because it is difficult for one to judge about himself.

117
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,040
-From now you will be a good boy.

118
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,240
Give the follow up to see if he became a good boy.

119
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:06,230
That was 3 years ago. Most probably it was 10M or 1M.

120
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:32,490
It is the follow up. Do we have the date?

121
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:56,900
February '87. That is September '86, about 6 months later.

122
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,650
-...and also without light.

123
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,050
-He had nightmares?

124
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:18,570
-Yes, he has also nightmares. But not crying in the night because he knew I was there.

125
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,400
-Do you see any difference?

126
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:39,920
-He had myopia in his right eye, -10 and one eye doctor and he can see only 5%.

127
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:47,570
-He can see only 5%. So little?

128
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:53,820
-So little and this has caused him problems.

129
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,080
-He took Stramonium?

130
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:13,070
-Yes, we came back, it was beginning of October '86 and he took 3 potencies,

131
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:25,580
1M, 10M and 50M Stramonium and in the first time I could not see change

132
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:39,060
but later he get to start to be softer and these aggressions he has, they are better.

133
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,980
He has situations sometimes, where he can throw a knife to his brother if he is angry

134
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,330
but it is not so often.

135
00:23:52,580 --> 00:24:01,730
With enuresis it is the same, there is no change and the reduced eye it is also the same,

136
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:10,580
he has now a contact lense in his eye but he gets problems with this because he gets

137
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:24,050
purulent activity sometimes. He had to give him also antibiotic in the eye

138
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:32,690
because it was so bad the cornea was also with ulcers, it became ulcerative...

139
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,310
-The enuresis is every night?

140
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:57,160
-Every night, I wake him up about 11 o'clock but in the morning he is usually wet.

141
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:05,980
I see the connection with sweet  juices and sweet drinks.

142
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,980
-If he drinks sweet, oranges and things like that?

143
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:21,840
-If he drinks mixed things, it is fantastic, in 5 minutes it goes away

144
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,170
and if it is in the night he can't hold it.

145
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:45,470
It was a period about 2 weeks a little bit better but I took him in the night

146
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,990
and in the morning he was dry.

147
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,240
-Why you stopped doing that?
-I do it.

148
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,220
-When it was these 14 days dry? It was in the beginning or after the medicine?

149
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:08,310
-About 2 weeks ago, after the medicine.

150
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:15,310
-Then the pattern came back as it was before or perhaps he was urinating twice

151
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:19,390
before the remedy and now once in a night?

152
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,050
-It was a little bit worse and now it is going to get better.

153
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:31,650
He is not wet like before he took the Stramonium.

154
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:41,060
-Did he get any other acute during this time? Any cold?

155
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:47,820
-No. He had no problems, only with his eye.

156
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,830
-How it was his appetite?

157
00:26:53,350 --> 00:27:00,720
-He likes sweets and he doesn't like vegetables and if he gets sweets, sweet bread

158
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:14,070
and marmalade, then he likes it. In the last time he ate also salty things.

159
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,000
-He started to like salty things?

160
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:24,150
-Yes, primarily he had something salty to put on the bread and he took it.

161
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,900
It's a salty pasta.

162
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,060
-And he likes it now?

163
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:56,040
-Yes, he eats it in the morning but he eats raisins and bread, this bread with butter

164
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,920
and the salty thing. Sweet and salty together.

165
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:12,050
-What about his sleep? He sleeps quietly or he is very restless or very aggressive he shouts?

166
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:27,230
-No, he is quiet in the night. Once it was a time he doesn't want to go alone in dark rooms.

167
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:32,490
He doesn't want to go in the toilet. I had to go and switch on the light

168
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:37,590
because he would say, I don't go, it is dark there.

169
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,730
-But that was better.

170
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:51,230
-No, the last two weeks it is better but it was a time it was not possible to tell him

171
00:28:51,330 --> 00:29:01,660
to go in a dark room and I had to go for him and switch the light on.

172
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:17,070
-Before did he use to get any acutes, like chest acutes? Any bronchitis, cough?

173
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:24,830
-No, he had nothing.

174
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:29,070
-Before Stramonium.

175
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:34,460
-Also nothing. He had one bronchitis in his life.

176
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,220
-Never again.
-Never.

177
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,970
-He is strong otherwise, only personality problems.

178
00:29:43,070 --> 00:30:01,820
-Yes and the last year he could not hear well. He had a big adenoid and it was...

179
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:12,470
It went like this. It was a long time that he could not hear.

180
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:20,650
-When it was the time that he could not hear?
-Last winter, 85.

181
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,250
-His right eye is affected?
-Yes.

182
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:57,190
If he gets nervous, he wants to go to toilet, more times.

183
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,440
-If he get anxious?
-Yes and nervous.

184
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,940
-And his stool is diarrheic?

185
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:09,030
-Only if he drinks milk but he doesn't like milk.

186
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:50,440
He has a very... carries in teeth. The first teeth are very bad.

187
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:05,130
-But he has become sweet now?

188
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,380
-A little bit soft but only a little bit.

189
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,030
-Still he is aggressive?
-Sometimes but we can manage.

190
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:27,090
-What he says about his right eye? If he closed the left one, what he will say

191
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:34,870
that it is foggy or he cannot see at all?

192
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:40,520
-We made this test and we see that he can't see enough

193
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:48,770
but we have problems to put occlusion on the left eye because he doesn't want

194
00:32:48,870 --> 00:33:02,370
and he put the occlusion away and we have to look for them, the glasses are away.

195
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:10,340
He hides them, he doesn't want to have all these things but when he has them on,

196
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,690
it is very astonishing how he manages.

197
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:26,080
When it's closed the right eye or he has to use it, he never falls or run against the wall.

198
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:40,180
-We try to put him on the ski and it was OK but if we make the normal eye test,

199
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:44,770
they see that he has only 5% of seeing.

200
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:49,670
-There is improvement with his eyes?
-No improvement.

201
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:55,670
For 2 months they closed the left eye and to let him look with the right eye

202
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:01,170
and it is the last year now because if this myopia doesn't go better,

203
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:06,870
in the 7th year it is like this and it stays. You have to take it like this.

204
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:52,830
-How long is now that he goes into the dark room, the last 2 weeks you said?

205
00:34:52,930 --> 00:35:03,360
-About a month it was like this and now about 2 weeks he goes, the last weeks are better.

206
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,820
-He starts going.

207
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:12,560
-No, it is not a problem. They don't see it like this, they don't mention it,

208
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:16,490
I have to go every morning.

209
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,160
-But something that disappeared was the stammering.

210
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,250
-Yes the stammering. It was away.

211
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,000
-Thank you.

212
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:49,210
So what you will do? What remedy? The remedy has acted?

213
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,300
-Yes.

214
00:35:52,560 --> 00:36:01,390
-You are not very convinced. This is where every homeopath goes wrong.

215
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:12,290
In any other case like that and you see improvement on the mental-emotional

216
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:20,030
that you are treating and you see improvement on stammering, you cannot say get remedy

217
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,130
because you are going to spoil the case.

218
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:32,040
Unless the child gets some antidotal influences, it will go better and better and better

219
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:42,880
and the child was already very much better. What we see here is 50% better.

220
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:10,880
What you have to understand is that these things do not just disappear like that,

221
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:20,310
do not raise the dead. He is a magician. We are not magicians.

222
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,970
There is pathology which has to follow a certain path.

223
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:33,720
The deeper it is, the longer it has to take before the cure is established.

224
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:41,720
In this case of enuresis, if you see a mental symptom going away, would you wait,

225
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:47,780
you would suppose that the remedy has acted and wait for the enuresis? I said yes.

226
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:58,060
Do you remember a case, a boy with enuresis, with personality problems and with asthma?

227
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:02,280
Some of you have seen, you have not seen the whole thing

228
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:08,040
but in this case we have the same idea.

229
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:16,710
Enuresis continued for another few months. The boy was 11 years old when we saw it,

230
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:22,030
with severe enuresis every day and it continued for several period of time

231
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:30,290
until the level of amelioration arrived at that point.

232
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:41,520
The amelioration had started from the inside. As soon as he comes in, if you don't see,

233
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:47,270
if you don't realize that the child is 50% better, you are not yet a student of Homeopathy,

234
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,380
not a homeopath, a student of Homeopathy.

235
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,270
You have to observe immediately the changes that took place and the changes

236
00:38:55,370 --> 00:39:00,600
that took place emotionally are depicted upon the person.

237
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,010
You don't wait for them to tell you little things.

238
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:16,030
So I have seen outrageous things like for instance a patient is doing very well

239
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:26,220
and the doctor come in and says how are you? And he says, I have a sore throat

240
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,580
and I got headaches.

241
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:39,070
Yesterday I had headaches and you write sore throat, headaches and my pains are these and that

242
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:48,910
and I was very irritable with my wife. You write 3 pages of symptoms and you say now what?

243
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,660
The thing is why the patient had come originally to you?

244
00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:01,570
And if he had come because he had depression and now he has all these symptoms,

245
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,160
it doesn't matter all these symptoms.

246
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:09,060
The person is doing well, there are certain rules of course

247
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,310
and unless a clear cut remedy is indicated now, you do not touch the case.

248
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:21,320
All the symptomatology will go away. Unless you understand that, you are not doing Homeopathy.

249
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,070
You are doing allopathic medicine.

250
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:28,480
Take this for that symptom, take that for that symptom, forget it.

251
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:38,390
I hope to be able to show you a case since 2 years, a case of encephalomyelitis,

252
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:42,990
exhaustion, exhaustion and all these kind of things.

253
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:50,560
And to be able to show you follow ups and to see the person in the end

254
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,560
and say if it is better or it is the same.

255
00:40:53,660 --> 00:41:00,410
But if you see the written follow ups and what he says, you think he is not doing well.

256
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:09,570
I said no, placebo, placebo until you see the real miracle or you will never see a miracle

257
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:14,060
or you will see it for a very short period of time and then forget about it,

258
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,170
the whole thing will come back.

259
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,060
If you don't stick to the principles, forget it.

260
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:32,550
If you are not aware of what is going on in a person before even speaks,

261
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,150
it's very difficult to practice Homeopathy.

262
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:54,400
I have explained this so many times that anybody in the class can give you the explanation.

263
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:02,670
-What happens if you repeat now 1M?
-Terrible mistake.

264
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,320
I would consider a period of aggravation.

265
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:36,140
First of all the aggravation in these children, you may see for 1-2 days they are more aggressive

266
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,650
but maybe the parents will not take notice of that, they will not mention it.

267
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:46,220
It doesn't mean it doesn't exist. There is definitely an aggravation in the dark.

268
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,240
He was afraid of the dark but perhaps not so much for the whole month.

269
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:08,140
Things are coming in order. Where is aggression and where is fear of dark?

270
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,140
What is more important for the organism to fix first, aggression or fear of the dark?

271
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:22,390
It decides. The organism says fix first aggression and then comes the fear of the dark

272
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:26,990
and then comes the stomach and then comes the enuresis.

273
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:36,900
There is a sequence of events which take place inside and you can not force

274
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,590
another course of action.

275
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,440
This is the only course of action that you can take, give the remedy, watch and wait.

276
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,430
How is the right eye now?

277
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:08,780
- ...so often that it would disturb the child...

278
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:31,260
-The father says there is no problem with the vision but he has not examined...

279
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:37,410
In times we may have that feedback of that portion.

280
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:47,760
What you would expect an improvement of the eye of an order of 60%?

281
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:00,770
-Carries

282
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,660
-Can you tell us about carries in the teeth?

283
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,510
-No problem.

284
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:19,400
-The aggressiveness, as the father says, there is no problem.

285
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:29,160
But you see the child so much better, why you ask all these questions?

286
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:34,280
I have not asked all these questions, I can see it immediately,

287
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,770
there is an intensity which is gone. It's tremendous.

288
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:47,010
The remedy has acted, this is the main thing, just wait and you will see the changes.

289
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:55,160
Be unbelievers, do not believe anything until you see, not one time, 20 times

290
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:03,260
but when you see 20 times that's enough. Sit down and study, sit down and learn.

291
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:16,410
Once you understand you have given the right remedy, you wait and wait and wait

292
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:19,990
and you will see things falling into the right place.

293
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:24,480
The child came for three things, enuresis, aggression and his eye problem.

294
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:28,480
When everyone is going to be arranged we do not know, what we want to know

295
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,990
is whether the remedy is acting, you must understand immediately.

296
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:38,570
Even after 2-3 weeks, you understand whether your remedy has acted and don't touch it.

297
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:43,740
It is terrible to spoil a good action of a remedy

298
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,990
because you will never come back in that remedy again.

299
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:51,490
We gave Stramonium and it didn't work, now we give Hyoscyamus, we give Belladonna

300
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:56,230
and you will go through the whole Materia Medica and you will never see of course the remedy

301
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:58,330
because the remedy is Stramonium.
