1
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:38,210
-Last time you did not take any medicine. You tell me after October what happened.

2
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:45,250
-The greatest change I can notice it that I'm going into much more direct and stronger

3
00:00:45,350 --> 00:01:01,000
confrontation with my mother. For years and years I always tried to evade her and

4
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,670
in spite of that we kept having conflicts.

5
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:08,170
-And now she has the strength to confront her?

6
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:15,170
-I can endure better, I can stay there and listen and hear everything she has to tell me

7
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,040
without breaking down immediately.

8
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:26,770
-But does she state her own opinion?

9
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:35,070
-For months I tried to avoid the conflict, I did have contact but only shortly just as much

10
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,820
as I could take and then I went back into my house.

11
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,560
But then she, from her side was searching confrontation. She again started to accuse

12
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:53,390
me and to complain about me and I could remain in there, stay there, listen to what

13
00:01:53,490 --> 00:02:00,830
she had to say and tell her my opinion. Then she really accelerated.

14
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,220
And I could endure it. She became really intense and there were many accusations

15
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:16,130
against me and at the end she cried but I could endure it.

16
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:24,130
Then I could also tell her all the things she had done to me which also weren't very nice.

17
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:29,490
-She managed to tell her what she had felt she had done to her?

18
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:36,220
-Not all, that's a long story but the most important things.

19
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,460
Then she was crying and shouting and expected me to understand her.

20
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,670
-How old is her mother now?

21
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:53,630
-85 but she is still completely clear at her mind.

22
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,910
-And I told her I don't want to understand you if you don't, for once, stop and say

23
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:06,380
I'm sorry for what I did to you or for what happened to you.

24
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,380
Then it took a couple of days and then she came to me and she still was angry but

25
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,140
she said, I'm sorry.

26
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,460
-For the beginning it's good.

27
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,220
-I can understand that my family was in a very difficult situation and crazy.

28
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,210
I can understand why some situations were the way they were and what happened

29
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:41,800
to me but I felt so much indignation that the situation was as it was and they put

30
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,300
me into it and I had to suffer and then making me responsible for it.

31
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:55,550
That was something I could not take. All these years my mother had the opinion that

32
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:06,300
it's my fault that she had to suffer so much because of me and I always felt such an

33
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,250
injustice but I could never express it to her, in any way.

34
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:22,960
I have to make a short break now because I really plan not to cry here again.

35
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:30,130
-It's OK if she wants to cry. No problem.

36
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:39,640
-I'm so embarrassed, I don't want it to happen. I would like to turn to the physical

37
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:49,880
complains. I had very severe pains the entire October and November up to Christmas.

38
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,880
-Where?

39
00:04:51,980 --> 00:05:00,630
-Most of the time my right shoulder. The same thing I already had in May.

40
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,880
It continued for the entire year.

41
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,880
-The pains subsided in January?

42
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,630
-They start to change in a way. They were some days where they seem to ease off

43
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:23,080
a bit and I felt well I might be through this now but it again started and so actually up

44
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:31,810
to March I had long periods of time with pain, interrupted by few days with less pain

45
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,220
and then it started again.

46
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,760
-After March until now?

47
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:46,140
-Since March the periods with less pain have become longer and the painful periods

48
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:56,120
are not so painful. In fall the pains were so severe that I couldn't sleep for nights.

49
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,620
-Did she take any pain killer?

50
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:08,420
-No and when I saw Sabine I felt my own pains again so strongly I could hardly bear it.

51
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:17,670
But it got better. I now have less pains in my shoulder, my elbow and my wrist but now

52
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:32,590
the pains wandered into my knees. But it's not so severe as it was in the shoulders.

53
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,080
My feet are also very sensitive. They are often painful.

54
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,580
-Where?

55
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:48,340
-Mainly the soles of my foot when I have to walk much and sometimes I have pain in

56
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:59,400
my left big toe. It feels the way I could imagine gout from how I have been described it

57
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:05,900
even though I don't eat any meat and hardly I drink alcohol.

58
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,790
-Has she ever checked the uric acid?

59
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,990
-No.

60
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,340
-She can check it when she is back.

61
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:21,600
-The flashes of heat have become stronger. I never experienced such a warm winter

62
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,590
even though it was cold outside and sometimes it's alternating heat flashes and

63
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:34,510
perspiration, alternating with little chills suddenly.

64
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:42,310
The heat flashes begin in the face, my face becomes hot and burning, then it goes down

65
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:51,560
my neck and then it spreads down my middle part and then my entire body.

66
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:59,890
As very last thing, my feet burn. Everything is burning.

67
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,920
-But it goes from the head down.

68
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:11,100
-It starts on my face. I have to undress then and then I quickly cool down again and

69
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,500
feel cold.

70
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:23,980
My sensitivity towards dampness and cold together is still very strong.

71
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,700
Even in summer I can not tolerate wet clothing in my arms and if I wash my hands or

72
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,400
have to do anything else with water, I immediately have to dry off my hands again.

73
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:44,640
On the other hand I also can not tolerate great warmth or heat.

74
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,810
I like the sun but I can only stay in it for a short while. It is wonderful to see the sun

75
00:08:50,910 --> 00:09:00,480
outside from here but if I come into the sun I quickly feel too hot and I become nauseous.

76
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:09,480
On the other hand I can't endure cold food from the refrigerator.

77
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:18,510
-So she needs either warm or room temperature? Or she needs warm food?

78
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:28,470
-I prefer warm food at least once the day even if it's only a soup. That's enough or tea.

79
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:34,390
When I'm thirsty I drink water with room temperature.

80
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,390
In the past half year there were times that I could not eat much.

81
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:44,180
-Did she lose weight?

82
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:51,390
-No. Like only half a croissant. Afterwards I felt satisfied, full, bloated and couldn't eat

83
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,640
anything. It's not always like that. Right now I can eat a bit more.

84
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,390
-From time to time.

85
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:09,310
-I got a cold in November. It wasn't very strong, no fever. I never have fever.

86
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:14,300
-We expect this year.

87
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:22,410
-I had pain in my throat and coryza. It was about one week medium strong, then it

88
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,920
got less but the complains lasted for another 5-6 weeks.

89
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:33,420
And on and off I repeatedly had watery discharge from the nose which was acrid and

90
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:39,670
hurting my nose. For a long time over weeks the feeling of mucus in my throat.

91
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:45,710
It was running down the back of my throat and I constantly had to swallow and hawk.

92
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:52,840
And couldn't speak so fluently because there was constantly mucus on the way.

93
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,790
-Her voice was affected? She had to clear her throat all the time?

94
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:02,090
-I wasn't hoarse, I had to clear my throat very often, the voice was somehow changed.

95
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,850
Between November and now the beginning of May a couple of times I had a kind of

96
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:16,630
vaginitis, the mucus membranes were sore and aching, partially it was so painful that

97
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,230
I had difficulty walking and I couldn't ride a bicycle, I couldn't sit on it.

98
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,790
-Such a thing she remembers having ever in the past?

99
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:34,860
-Yes. I was in homeopathic treatment for about 10 years and then I developed these strong

100
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,600
complains after one remedy. After it they gave me Kreosotum and then it was

101
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,630
gone.

102
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:47,040
-But does she remember if she was infected through intercourse.

103
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,290
-No, I don't think so. I can't remember.

104
00:11:51,390 --> 00:12:00,240
-Previous to that was again, as a young girl, she had something like this?

105
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,200
-Definitely as a girl I did not have it.

106
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,210
-Does she remember having leucorrhea?

107
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,870
-Since the birth of my daughter almost 29 years ago, I almost constantly have more

108
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,120
or less leucorrhea.

109
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,790
-Was anytime that the leucorrhea was strong and she went to gynecologist and took

110
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,070
some medicine for it?

111
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:29,530
-Yes that was once around 1974 or 75.

112
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:38,960
-And if she remembers, she took medication for only 1-2 days or she took for a week?

113
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:45,210
-The usual time is one week.

114
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:51,960
-Does she remember if after this week, the leucorrhea disappeared?

115
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,210
-I can't remember.

116
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,950
-Does she remember what was the medicine?

117
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,620
-Clont was the name.

118
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:12,650
-There are some symptoms here which I would like to ask.

119
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,480
-You want me to finish before? -Yes.

120
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:19,980
-I repeatedly had inflammation of my gums last winter.

121
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:26,730
The last time was when I was on the island for 4 days.

122
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:32,900
-Concerning the leucorrhea now at this moment there is some discharge or very little

123
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,920
or nothing?

124
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,770
-Since my menstruation stopped completely about 3/4 of a year ago, I still had for

125
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:45,690
some months slight discharge and now it has completely gone.

126
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:54,570
-This inflammation of the vagina is still at this moment continues? It lasted how long?

127
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:08,470
-It lasted a few days. I had it for a couple of times and always lasted for a few days

128
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,910
but right now I don't have it.

129
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,100
-She had it several times?

130
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:27,820
-Within the last 3/4 of a year I had it a couple of times. I often have toothache, there is

131
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,510
one tooth which aches too often but the dentist can find no reason for it.

132
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:40,200
I had gastrointestinal infection at the end of December. I was kissed by a child that was

133
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:46,930
already ill, that's how I contracted it and within a couple of hours I was also ill.

134
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,470
-With diarrhea?

135
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,610
-It lasted for one week with nausea, vomiting and great prostration.

136
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:59,860
Diarrhea only the first day. What was really remarkable was that during this

137
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:07,270
gastrointestinal problem, my shoulder pains were completely gone and when I

138
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,450
recovered from gastrointestinal problems my pains were back, which just underlines

139
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:15,440
your theory.

140
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:22,440
From the beginning of February I had more energy again and sometimes I work for

141
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,710
24 hours at the time and continue the next day and sometimes I'm really amazed

142
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,940
that I bring up the strength to do all this, so I can't be that ill.

143
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:42,700
The problem is also that I often have an itching mostly on the upper part of my back.

144
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:50,910
I have to scratch until it burns and if I scratch till it burns and hurts, then the itching stops.

145
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,670
For a certain period of time.

146
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,170
-When this itching started?

147
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,670
-It has been long already. I didn't mention last time because there were so many other

148
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,920
things to tell, maybe 2 years.

149
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:11,080
-But if she mentions this now is more strong?

150
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:18,450
-Not really strong. I also sometimes have this itching in different parts of my body.

151
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:26,450
I always have to scratch something and when I scratch here it disappears from this

152
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:33,200
side and it appears to some other place. This can be anywhere in my body.

153
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,110
But I'm always scratching in some place. I had another cold in February also without

154
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:46,620
fever, with a cough, but I recovered quickly from it. It lasted 1 week but the cough

155
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,110
continued for 6 weeks.

156
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:56,810
When the cough and the cold were gone I started to have stomach pains.

157
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:04,540
Often I had a feeling about 1 hour after eating that I had stones in my stomach.

158
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,790
Very painful pressure.

159
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:09,780
-Is this a new symptom or she had it?

160
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:17,290
-I had stomach complains once before in 1968 or 69 when I had stressful job.

161
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,030
-Something similar?

162
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:25,280
-Yes but it was stronger including a gastritis. This time is not like that.

163
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:33,040
Another symptom reappeared. Sometimes my legs jerk and I can't hold them still.

164
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,730
-Jerking while sitting or in bed?

165
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:51,700
-When I'm resting, when I'm quite. Less when I'm sitting, more frequently when I'm

166
00:17:51,800 --> 00:18:03,370
lying and before I fall asleep.

167
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:09,500
Then I had complains with my eyes. I feel as if I had sand in my eyes and there was a

168
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:18,510
constant burning, it was worse in the left eye. The doctor could not find anything special.

169
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:25,730
I'm supposed to wear my glasses more frequently and at the moment this is also better.

170
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,540
There is something I doubt quite a lot when the was in Kosovo started.

171
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:40,170
I felt great anxiety. This is going on for several weeks now and I seriously was thinking

172
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:46,430
whether I could travel into this area which is close to the war at all.

173
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:54,020
Very often every day I become aware how many people are affected by it and I compare

174
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,750
my life situation with the situation of those people who have to leave their country or

175
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:08,760
get bomb on their heads and I'm so glad that I'm OK, that I feel good.

176
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:14,950
But we never know what is coming towards us.

177
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:25,340
-I don't see here the trembling that was so strong before, external trembling.

178
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,590
Does she have it still when excited or just happen?

179
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,590
-I don't get it with every excitement but it was so strong because of the memory of my

180
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,340
childhood experiences.

181
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:48,090
-Last time interview she had it but now as she was relating the conversation with her

182
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,530
mother, I didn't notice it.

183
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:58,500
-I still need to bring up a lot of energy not to cry and not to tremble but it's true I've

184
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,760
got stronger.

185
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,310
-Also last time she had cracks in the corner of the mouth.

186
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:15,170
-This has not reappeared but when I have coryza because of the acrid exudation

187
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:23,330
I have cracks around my nose in the corner. And also during the time of vaginits I had

188
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:29,590
cracks fissures in the mucus membranes.

189
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,120
-How is her desire for salt.

190
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,950
-A bit less.

191
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,110
-What about the aversion for meat.

192
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:47,830
-My entire life I never liked meat and as a child I was forced to eat it.

193
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,330
Now I decide for myself.

194
00:20:50,430 --> 00:21:12,000
-But she is a vegetarian or just she doesn't like meat and she eats fish or eggs?

195
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,250
-Coffee?

196
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,170
-Absolutely not.

197
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,920
-This is strong aversion.

198
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:24,420
-It is absolutely strong aversion, I can't even tolerate the smell of coffee. I had times when

199
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,170
I drunk a lot of coffee.

200
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:32,910
-That's all I wanted. Does she have anything to report?

201
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:40,670
-My aversion also to tobacco smoke has increased much. I can't breathe if a smoker

202
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:47,180
comes towards me. I think it's quite sad because many people I like a lot, they smoke.

203
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:57,920
But I just have to go away from them because I can't bear it. I developed varicose veins.

204
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,410
-Painful?

205
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:08,690
-Sometimes I feel pain in my right leg, the back of my knee. What I can not tolerate at all

206
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:16,390
is if I have to sit to some place where my feet have no support, I turn out to be a bit short

207
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,380
and most chairs are a bit high for me and my feet just hang in the air and I have no

208
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,380
support beneath them, I can not take it at all.

209
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:35,890
-She wants to give me an overall impression how she feels psychologically in general?

210
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:42,640
-Stronger concerning those things that I still have to take care in my life, that I have to

211
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:50,140
deal with, I have to get done.

212
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:57,130
What it also changed is that I noticed that sometimes I react more irritated towards some

213
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:03,840
people which I don't know from myself up to now. I think that's not so bad.

214
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:13,300
I can handle that once in a while.

215
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:24,550
-From the last time psychologically there is no much difference? It has been an

216
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,310
improvement or more or less the same?

217
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:36,550
-Yes I've become stronger. The main problem I see now for many years was this

218
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:43,760
confrontation with my mother and I didn't have such a breakdown anymore, the times

219
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,970
when she approached me and accused me and all these things. I didn't break down

220
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:53,470
anymore, that's good for me.

221
00:23:53,570 --> 00:24:17,470
-OK.

222
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:38,670
-First of all you see the physical symptomatology following the right direction.

223
00:24:38,770 --> 00:25:16,140
You say from shoulder, to elbow, to wrist, to knee, it's very good.

224
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:25,890
Another thing which pleases you to see is what?

225
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,020
-Discharges that make sores

226
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:44,490
-I'm pleased to see that the vagina's inflamed. This is a good sign. You are also pleased to see

227
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:52,750
from the physical point of view some old symptoms like the gastritis or the feeling of

228
00:25:52,850 --> 00:26:15,250
the stones in the stomach. It is quite all right.

229
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:38,170
In this case I see 3 strong symptoms of another remedy.

230
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:47,670
You take the case and you see on one hand the direction is OK. She is more composed

231
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:55,910
she can express, she can confront the main problem that was the mother who had

232
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:02,670
suppressed her all these years, the trembling and you remember the state which she has

233
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:07,160
been before and all that is much more reduced.

234
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:23,160
All that it is solved but at the same time you see 3 strong symptoms of another remedy

235
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:32,830
and you have to ask yourself the same question, are you going to wait, are you going to

236
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:44,580
give another remedy and if you are going to give another remedy, the other remedy is?

237
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:51,830
-Staphysagria....

238
00:27:51,930 --> 00:28:06,080
-No, you did not see the remedy.

239
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,530
-Pulsatilla is coming.

240
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:17,750
-Pulsatilla? No.

241
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:21,240
-Natrum muriaticum.

242
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:34,500
-Natrum muriaticum?

243
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:47,250
I'll tell you something. If you remember she had a symptom that did not fit with Causticum.

244
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:53,250
-Aggravation from cold and moist weather.

245
00:28:53,350 --> 00:29:02,000
-Where Causticum is better with moist weather. She has an extreme aggravation from

246
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:11,500
moist. She can even have a little bit of water, she has to dry it.

247
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:19,670
But Causticum feels better when the weather is moist.

248
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:31,160
So this was a symptom that did not go with Causticum. This is one thing that you take

249
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:40,660
into consideration and then you see this symptom is not gone. So either it's going to go

250
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:49,310
away later on or the symptoms belongs to the underlying remedy.

251
00:29:49,410 --> 00:30:02,010
Maybe you are going to search for underlying remedy which is worse with cold and moist.

252
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:09,510
Anyhow you have to ask, even if we come to the conclusion that most probably we have

253
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:20,610
an underlying remedy which is this or that, we have still to determine whether this level

254
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:24,860
which is the Causticum level has been exhausted.

255
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:40,520
Is this level out or she is still having the characteristics of Causticum?

256
00:30:40,620 --> 00:31:03,520
She got a high potency 1 year ago. Is she out or maybe we have to repeat?

257
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:09,690
What makes you think that it is out or it is in?

258
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:23,440
She said another expression, which is very characteristic of the sympathetic element of

259
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:33,690
Causticum. She made a comment, who remembers? Before Kosovo.

260
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:41,970
Still she made another remark which showed me the sympathetic element still is quite

261
00:31:42,070 --> 00:32:03,140
strong. And the injustice also is strong.

262
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:16,570
Can you see jerking of legs? Extremities, jerking of legs on falling asleep?

263
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:42,580
This is a new symptom? No. It's still a symptom that continues.

264
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,570
-Varicose veins is a new one she said.

265
00:32:47,670 --> 00:33:15,080
-Varicose veins on legs so painful.

266
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:23,320
You see the new symptom that she develops is a physical symptom belonging to

267
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:32,820
Causticum. So what I'm driving at is, the sympathetic element is there.

268
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:52,820
Quite a lot of her symptoms are still there and we have the right kind of direction towards

269
00:33:52,920 --> 00:34:05,250
the extremities and perhaps ending on the toes, fingers and toes which is Causticum.

270
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:19,110
Therefore in spite of the fact that maybe there is another underlying remedy

271
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:24,140
what shall we do? We wait or we repeat the remedy?

272
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:35,040
-Wait.

273
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:40,780
-I want to ask her what does she think?

274
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,780
She thinks that she needs the remedy at the moment?

275
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:51,780
We're going to repeat. We're not going away from this remedy. The remedy is acting

276
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:59,530
quite well but we're thinking whether we should give you another dose.

277
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:07,730
Do you think that you need this dose or you think, I'm good enough, leave me alone?

278
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:20,030
-Before I decide I would like to know what do I have to expect if we repeat?

279
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:26,270
-That's a good question. I can not guarantee.

280
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:34,030
-Why do you like to to repeat it then?

281
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:44,780
-I don't like to repeat it. I'm thinking, the class is thinking or some of the class is thinking

282
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:55,470
and we're asking you. You are only the patient now, you are not the doctor.

283
00:35:55,570 --> 00:36:07,950
And you know how you feel and the doctor asks you, do you feel you need some extra

284
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:20,700
push at the moment or do you think things are developing quite well and I'm satisfied.

285
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:28,690
-Nevertheless I'm interested by my minds, I have an idea beforehand, do I have to come

286
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:36,700
with a strong aggravation or with a push to my development?

287
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:49,360
-Most probably she will have an aggravation again before she has the push.

288
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:58,360
-I have to work a lot the summertime and if I'm going to have such pains again I just don't

289
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,860
know how I'm going to tolerate, how to cope with this.

290
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,530
Do I have to expect such an aggravation like I had it last Autumn?

291
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:15,530
-Most probably the aggravation will be less. It's not going to be again so strong.

292
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:21,780
-Then I've courage enough to try it.

293
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:33,530
-OK. Now you hear your patient what she says and now you tell me who wants to

294
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:42,280
repeat the remedy?

295
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:53,950
7 courageous people plus the patient.

296
00:37:54,050 --> 00:38:01,610
Who wants to wait?

297
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:08,860
We wait unfortunately.

298
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:20,360
Now concerning the remedy which I think it is underneath, which may come without

299
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:35,610
another dose. Once the sympathetic element is subsided or it subsides 50-60% because

300
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:41,030
she has her own character, she is not going to change, she always going to be on that

301
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,030
sympathetic.

302
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:56,120
But is she subsides 60% then you can say that Causticum has done whatever it could.

303
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:10,250
Therefore you can be thinking on the next remedy and I would like to have the symptom

304
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:28,830
aversion coffee.

305
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:43,250
She stressed, from her desires and aversions, two things. Aversion to coffee, no question

306
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:52,490
and aversion to tobacco, no question. Even people I like I can not stand their company.

307
00:39:52,590 --> 00:40:05,490
Unfortunately I have to leave. You have to look in these two rubrics.

308
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:12,410
Calcarea and Nux vomica.

309
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:26,330
Show me now aversion tobacco. Calcarea and Nux vomica.

310
00:40:26,430 --> 00:41:03,910
Now you look at aggravation coffee. Causticum is quite strong.

311
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:12,420
You can compare the two, the Causticum is in both.

312
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:21,330
Causticum may not take away certain symptoms. Those symptoms which are not taken

313
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:27,330
away by Causticum, belong to another layer.

314
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:50,140
 that we had them originally in the Causticum, since they stay, they belong to the

315
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,300
underlying layer.

316
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:03,060
So the aggravation from wetness, this aggravation from coffee, this aversion for tobacco

317
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:39,000
-Belladonna, Ignatia, Nux vomica, Pulsatilla.

318
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:54,330
Therefore we may come to the conclusion that perhaps underlying Causticum, there is the

319
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:59,840
possibility of Nux vomica.

320
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:07,800
Do we give Nux vomica? No, forget it.

321
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:24,190
She said, I'm very irritable lately not too much but never happened before which is

322
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:33,430
something new for you. But if she comes to the point where she will come in the

323
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:41,100
consultation and say, I had a terrible fight with the mother and I told her what I thought

324
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:51,340
and I hit, you will see the anger being expressed and she will complain but it is too much

325
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:59,050
now. I express the anger too much so it creates a disturbance all around me, that is the

326
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:07,020
time you may think of giving a dose of Nux Vomica, not now.
