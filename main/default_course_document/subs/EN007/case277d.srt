1
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,300
-What was the last remedy?

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,710
-The last remedy I got was Natrum Muriaticum, 50M.

3
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,310
-One dose?
- Yes.

4
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:52,220
-What happened after Natrum Muriaticum? This you received in May?

5
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,060
-In May, on Tuesday, I can't remember the date.

6
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:10,210
I got immediate reaction concerning as if something was waving outside my head.

7
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:18,210
It was very strange because as if it was more strings or more the magnetic field.

8
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:21,970
It was not inside my head but outside, something stretching.

9
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:29,460
And it kept on the whole day, the first day and beside that I got itching around my nose.

10
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,800
I had to sit like this all the time because it was really annoying;

11
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:53,400
then it came a pain in my neck, it went forward to the front head, on both sides I got a pressure.

12
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,550
Then I got a sudden need for urinating.

13
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,300
-Sudden urinating. A lot?

14
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,230
-When this came on I suddenly had to go to the toilet.

15
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:18,960
Then I got a stitching pain in my upper abdomen. That was the first day.

16
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:29,270
The second I woke up refreshed, as I always do but about 10.30-11.00 o'clock

17
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,870
the head pain started again, the same kind.

18
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:48,030
I got a lump in my throat, I started to get a feeling I wanted to cry.

19
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,020
-Without reason?

20
00:02:52,120 --> 00:03:00,400
-Yes without reason, so I had to swallow a lot just not to start crying inside.

21
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,530
Then I got a pain in my left knee.

22
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:13,040
-For how long?
-Just that day, it went cracking while walking.

23
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:27,280
I could hear the sound. In the evening when we went eating, I usually don't eat ice cream

24
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,290
but I got a sudden craving for it that evening.

25
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:41,530
And the next day too. The third day my intestines were rambling a lot, I told you about last time

26
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,870
that I was very bloated. This was very intense.

27
00:03:49,880 --> 00:04:01,520
The stitching pain came in my right side in the liver area and it went towards this side

28
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:10,130
and it was just after eating that stitching pain.

29
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:20,380
In this area it was before eating and when I was eating it went on to this side.

30
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:29,860
All these days while I was staying here, I only stayed for one week

31
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:40,350
because I went to a course in Denmark and all this time my eyes were very sore,

32
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:52,610
it was like if I had stones or sand inside and I got some pus but that I already told about.

33
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,200
-Pus?
-Some yellow pus in my eyes.

34
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:08,860
The same headache came on and I was generally very tired, it started again, exhausted.

35
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:17,860
-Which day is this?
-The third day. I was a bit tired the two first.

36
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,660
-But the third day it was more.
- Yes.

37
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,030
As the time passed by, it got more and more and more.

38
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:33,520
So I couldn't nearly keep on with the lecturing in Denmark, I had to lie down for each break

39
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,040
to sleep and I just vanished.

40
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,110
While lying...

41
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,370
-Immediately you slept?
-Immediately I slept.

42
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:55,690
But then something changed with the head pain because in the beginning it started at 10.30

43
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:08,870
and 11 o'clock but after these 3 first days, it started to come on in the evening at 6.30-7.

44
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,520
My voice started to vanish ...

45
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,770
-Started to vanish without having a cold?

46
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:31,690
-Yes I didn't have any cold that time. I was swimming a lot.

47
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:36,010
-Swimming where?
-In the sea, down here.

48
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,110
-You are talking still while you were here?
-Yes.

49
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:55,930
And I also got a pain in the left side, in the lower abdomen and that had stayed until today.

50
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,680
-That pain in the left ovary?

51
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:05,340
-Yes. I don't think it's the ovary, it's the large intestine.

52
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,010
-How do you know it's in the large intestine?

53
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:16,600
-Because somebody told me, not a doctor but somebody else told me that it was in the intestines.

54
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,110
-OK we'll see.

55
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:29,370
-Just a stitching pain and sometimes is also pressing.

56
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:43,020
-Then when I got to Denmark, I told you I was very tired and I also thought

57
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,270
that it was too much with all these people.

58
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:53,520
I was really having a hard time because they were people all around me,

59
00:07:53,620 --> 00:08:01,010
I couldn't go anywhere to sit by myself because I was living together with another student.

60
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:11,760
So I felt in a kind the way I described you about the house that in a way I was trapped.

61
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:25,520
But the feeling went away after one week at home, so you did a marvelous work.

62
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:38,990
I had a marvelous summer and everything has been to me in a way like coming home into myself.

63
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,490
I would like very much to thank you for this.

64
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,330
-Thank Homeopathy, not me.

65
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,560
-But not only the Homeopathy, it's the right remedy.

66
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,160
-The right remedy of course.

67
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:03,820
-I started to get the 23rd of May, I started to get eruptions on the skin

68
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:12,920
as if I was bitten from the mosquitoes. Most came on in this part on both sides.

69
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,390
I think I had two, one on my arm and one on my leg.

70
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,260
-Did you have this eruption before as a child?
-No.

71
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:37,750
I can have them when I drink white wine, I had it once in Germany but then they came on this spot.

72
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,410
-When you say then you mean with the wine?

73
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:48,590
-Yes with the wine but they look like the same.

74
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,820
It's stayed nearly for two months before they vanish; so in the 27th of May

75
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,070
I got this therapeutic blister on my left labia, it came on again.

76
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:20,150
The same head pain kept on in the evening and it started the itching in my right eye,

77
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:31,000
as it was a small spot but it's not like a pain but more like a soreness in a spot.

78
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:47,930
I had a period of time where I kept on this pain in my stomach, just after eating.

79
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:58,820
3rd of June I started to itch all over my body and that I have had several times.

80
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,570
There and there.

81
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:07,420
-Without eruption?
-Without eruption yes but it nearly killed me.

82
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:23,310
It' s just moved on and I started to have the cramping pain in my left hip;

83
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:30,060
that's also a symptom which I told you about, pain from the hip extending to the leg

84
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:46,080
and I got more irritated on the herpetic blister, it was more painful than it had been the last times.

85
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:58,220
At 10.30-11 o'clock I got so tired. Usually I go to sleep at 1.30 in the afternoon,

86
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,330
because then I need to go to sleep, so I take a break with my patients.

87
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:06,730
-1.30 in the afternoon you take a break?

88
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:16,570
-Yes because then I'm too exhausted to keep on but now the time changed.

89
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,080
I also had a lot of acid in my stomach in the evening.

90
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:31,990
I felt like I was hungry or wanted to have something in it because it was too much acid.

91
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,890
I also felt that the hemorrhoids wanted to come out but it was just a feeling,

92
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:45,410
but it actually didn't happen, it was a bit irritating.

93
00:12:50,910 --> 00:13:00,150
During the whole summer I've drinking a lot of water, much more than I usually drink.

94
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:10,800
Normally I would have it a little bit warmer in the daily temperature

95
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,910
but now I have to have it cold, really cold.

96
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:28,310
But when I drink, when it's cold, I get pain in my teeth and because of that I urinate more

97
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:37,550
but when this bloatedness in my lower abdomen comes on, I feel that when I urinate

98
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,800
I'm not finished, so I have to ...

99
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,800
-To wait. Some drops are coming after?

100
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:52,050
-It's not only drops, it's a little amount of urine.

101
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,400
-Interrupted urination.

102
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:02,560
-And the same happens if I wait for a long time to urinate.

103
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Generally I'm taking a little more sweets which I nearly not eat at all

104
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:21,800
and I'm very tired in the evening and that's unusual for me because I can't be up to 12 o'clock

105
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:28,240
and wake up at 5.45 and be refreshed.

106
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:38,640
But I have to go to sleep at 8.30 in the evening and I've got a stiffness around my ankles.

107
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:44,840
It's not a pain, it's not a swelling, it s a feeling of a stiffness.

108
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:53,840
-Stiffness in the ankles?
-Both ankles yes but it's mostly while sitting.

109
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:02,190
I've done a lot of study and if I sit for a long time this sensation comes on.

110
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,350
I'm itching much inside my hands without eruptions.

111
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:28,190
The hip pain, which I told you about, I have observed that it is much more intense

112
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:34,420
the day after having intercourse.

113
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:44,180
Then it really hurts and sometimes I feel as if they are coming on cramp in my leg,

114
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:48,530
but it's mostly if I do some exercise.

115
00:15:50,940 --> 00:16:05,440
I got a warts in my front head, so I have to pick it away because it's dry.

116
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,090
The whole summer I had pain in my teeth, so I had to go to the dentist

117
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:16,090
because it was aching and really feeling bad.

118
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,590
-What the dentist did?

119
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:28,100
-He examined, there was nothing wrong but he said it might be this upper part of the teeth

120
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:35,110
which the flesh has drawn back.

121
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:48,500
Generally I'm very warm, but I've never been sweating in my hands before.

122
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:56,010
Now I'm wet in my hands and my feet and hands are burning.

123
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,870
-And you take them out?
-Yes this summer I had to.

124
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:20,260
-Mentally and emotionally I'm very good, I'm not so restless, I enjoy the daily life more.

125
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:30,700
I think I can speak more freely, it's easier to take contact with people and have a conversation.

126
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:45,590
I realized how easy I got hurt before during this period and how sensitive I've been to criticism,

127
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:53,940
so now I can hear things and I can see them but I don't feel them anymore.

128
00:17:54,430 --> 00:18:01,190
It's a very strange way of recognizing or being aware.

129
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:12,490
I also have seen how afraid I was to say or do anything wrong,

130
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:19,250
so I'm much more free to speak, in a way.

131
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:27,830
I'm also much more sensitive, my eyes get wet when I talk about something that's good

132
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:32,170
or when other people do the same.

133
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,320
-You are touched.

134
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:49,780
-Very much, I get gooseflesh and tears and generally I feel more organized.

135
00:18:52,030 --> 00:19:00,680
It's easier for me to keep things, one at the time and not have 10 things going on

136
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:07,680
at the same time; that's also something I have realized during this period

137
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:23,180
that I had too much on at the same time. I've got lot of sexual power.

138
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,410
Actually so much that sometimes I get embarrassed, myself;

139
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:34,010
so to me now it's a kind of problem.

140
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:47,900
-But always as a young woman, at the age of 18-20 you had a lot of sexual energy or never?

141
00:19:48,000 --> 00:20:01,260
-No. Sometimes at the age of 24 or 25 I had it.

142
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:19,010
-You returned to that age. Everybody will ask for your remedy.

143
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:37,020
-But I have to tell you, after coming down here, the last mense period started a week later than usual.

144
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:43,980
But at that time I went to have my first lecturing in esoteric philosophy,

145
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:53,420
so perhaps it was because I was a bit upset doing new things and give lecture...

146
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,690
-You stressed yourself.

147
00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:03,170
-Yes maybe, that was what happened. But while coming down here I started to get some stringy,

148
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:14,020
bloody discharge and it went on for 3 days and then it started to become like bloody water.

149
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,770
It's not much, it's just drops.

150
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:27,420
And generally I perspire a lot here.

151
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,260
-Yes it's quite warm.

152
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:40,770
-But I don't get the skin eruptions anymore, I've been to the sun. That's good.

153
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,860
-How you feel in the sea? Are you swimming?

154
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,090
-I'm going down 6.45 swimming in the morning.

155
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,100
-You enjoy it.

156
00:21:51,200 --> 00:22:01,100
-Yes but I noticed that in the morning while swimming alone, I'm aware of what is underneath.

157
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,440
In a way, I might be a little afraid of what's underneath while swimming.

158
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:13,180
-We don't have sharks here in the sea.

159
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:30,090
-I just noticed it and I also get pain in my throat and yesterday my voice was vanishing again

160
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:35,190
but today is OK. That's about it.

161
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:49,690
-You gave a very detailed information, we don't have to ask more questions.

162
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:59,430
Did you ever have any gonorrhea?
-No never.

163
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:14,590
-You eat fruits which are unripe?
-No but I've started eating more fruits.

164
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:24,840
-But ripe, sweet fruits or not? You don't need sour?

165
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:47,430
-No but when I eat the dinner, I put a lot of this lime lemon.

166
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:01,380
Wait, new remedy, same remedy, higher potency? Which is for higher potency?

167
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,500
Same remedy? New remedy? Wait?

168
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:49,650
It is understood we can proceed, we have to wait, wait, 1,2,5 years,

169
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:55,520
as long as you don't drink coffee, you don't take any medicine...

170
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:03,840
And be careful also the Natrum Muriaticum cases, you have to tell them, not to take the mint.

171
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:12,030
The mint is affecting, washing your teeth with menthol toothpaste.

172
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,020
-I've done it several times.

173
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:24,790
-Change your toothpaste.
-It's a mouth wash, that's no good.

174
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:33,350
-I use some drops while having patients, I put them to my mouth.

175
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:46,110
-No, be careful. You use something else if you want to refresh your mouth, not menthol.

176
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,850
Last time you did not take any medicine,

177
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:11,450
so your last medication was Natrum Muriaticum 50M, one year ago.

178
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:21,360
Tell me how you are, how you feel.

179
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:31,000
-Psychologically I feel good, I have some problems with writing letters.

180
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:39,760
I suppose it's because of Natrum Muriaticum, I don't know, I've never had it.

181
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:43,000
-What do you mean writing letters?

182
00:26:43,100 --> 00:27:01,750
-When I go to take a "d" I write "g" and I also when I want to say something,

183
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:09,350
sometimes words don't come out; that's also something I'm not used to that.

184
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,260
It is not often but as I stand and talk with people...

185
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:23,610
-As if you stammer?
-No, I can't find the word.

186
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,110
But my main problem is physically.

187
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:44,850
I'm so warm, I'm sweating in my hands, all my life I've been very dry in my hands.

188
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:57,730
-And now you are sweating extremely. Only on hands or on the whole body?

189
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:05,010
-During the night time when I have the menses, I have profused sweating.

190
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,920
I'm totally wet on waking in the morning.

191
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:19,250
-What time you wake up?
-I've started to wake a little bit later, about 6.45.

192
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:39,150
-Every night you wake up with perspiration?

193
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:45,330
-More during menses but I'm always very, very warm.

194
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:51,330
I have to have my feet out of the covers during winter time.

195
00:28:51,430 --> 00:29:00,070
-Before you came here from Norway, did you have this sweating?

196
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:07,060
-Yes all the winter time but not like this.

197
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,170
-Now it's too much.

198
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:17,820
-I have to have the window open while I'm sitting and working and my patients always say my god,

199
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:24,900
how can you sit here? They are freezing for half an hour but I say, I have to have this cold room;

200
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,010
otherwise I couldn't work because I start sweating immediately,

201
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,110
when I start working with the foot reflexology.

202
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:42,100
And I started to write to you twice because this has been really a problem.

203
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:50,730
-You like to have a lot of water or cold drinks?

204
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,520
-I have to drink a lot.

205
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,450
-And you need cold water or warm water?

206
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:03,250
-Yes, more cold than I needed before. Much more cold.

207
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:07,750
-And big quantities or all the time just a little bit each time.

208
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:14,930
-No, I drink a lot like a glass of water.

209
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,500
-Do you also like to take more sweets lately?

210
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:30,000
-Yes, I've done that. Not much but I'm never used to sweets, so to me it's...

211
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,580
-It's a new habit.

212
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:42,690
-Yes, it is and not a good one actually because I gain weight.

213
00:30:48,430 --> 00:31:00,580
I also have eruptions during the winter time when I'm sweating and I get cold,

214
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:10,090
I have to scratch on my bag and in the back of my head and in this part...

215
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,270
-Of the palm.
-Yes, that I still do, itching here.

216
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:32,350
Eruptions, itching. But something that I've never had before, it has also come up lately.

217
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:45,310
I feel a pain in my chest, I feel that it's difficult when I walk upstairs, if it's a hill.

218
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:49,480
-You have a pain on your chest.

219
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:56,740
-I wouldn't call it a pain, it' more like something is there in a point.

220
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,060
-Discomfort.

221
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:07,060
-Yes and I went to a colleague because I started to get afraid that I will have a heart disease.

222
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,560
-You did a cardiogram?

223
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:17,310
-No, no just to a reflexologist and I didn't say what it was but he told me

224
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:35,730
that the aorta hurted under the feet. And I'm smoking a lot,

225
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,840
so I was afraid that I got a heart disease.

226
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:44,980
-You smoke a lot? How much 20?
-Yes.

227
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,670
-Not 20, it's 25 actually, I saw it in your eyes.
-Maybe some days.

228
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:58,330
I know I smoke too much.

229
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:14,830
I also noticed that two days before menses are the most cold days for me.

230
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:20,230
-You feel cold?
-Yes and then I get some shivering.

231
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,320
-You like a cold or hot bath?

232
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,810
-I like to bath in the sea but I just got the menses,

233
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:10,560
so these two days before I didn't want to go to the sea but I'm swimming 4-5 times

234
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:15,660
when I come, cool bath.

235
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,060
-And hot?

236
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:26,270
-Not so much I don't like it because usually my husband is on the shower

237
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:30,660
more hot than me so I have to put it down.

238
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,560
-What about the odor of the perspiration? There is any odor?

239
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:57,080
-Sour. But it also could smell a little bit under the axilla while I work hard but mostly is more sour.

240
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:05,070
And I also got a lot of pimples in the neck.

241
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,080
-On the margin of the hair.

242
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:21,580
-During the winter time I had a lot of headaches.

243
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:34,830
-Did you find yourself in a high place looking down, can you tell me your experience?

244
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:43,980
-I can't tell because I haven't been out in high places but sometimes I get a little bit dizzy

245
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:51,580
just for a little moment, feeling that I don't have the balance.

246
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,230
-In high places?

247
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:59,480
-No, even in flat ground, it's coming suddenly and I have to do like this;

248
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:05,910
I feel like I'm having a vertigo in a way.

249
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:15,730
-You did not mention the pain in the left ovary.

250
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:24,480
-Yes I have it but it's more in the right now. And it goes from one side to the other.

251
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:29,570
This time was more on the right side, stitching pain.

252
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,730
-As strong as before, more, less?

253
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:43,080
-I think it was very strong this time. More strong than before.

254
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:58,330
-How is your organization? You're organized or disorganized?

255
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:09,560
-I have to pull myself up to be organized because I put things away.

256
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,790
-You just throw things around?
-Yes I do. It's a mess.

257
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:18,660
-You are disorganized actually.
-Yes, very disorganized, my husband says.

258
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:28,080
-So we have to organize you.
-That would be good.

259
00:38:38,820 --> 00:39:01,480
-Sloppy.
-When I get stressed, I have a headache.

260
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:11,390
It's coming about the 7th thoracal on the back to occiput.

261
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,680
-How frequently you get this headache?

262
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:19,990
-Not so frequently as in the winter time but it's really much because I work a lot

263
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:23,550
and every time I get stressed, I got this headache.

264
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,300
-It was after exertion?

265
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:41,790
-Yes and I'm much more tired in the evening. I told that I wanted to take a nap about 1.30

266
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:48,400
but that I don't do so much anymore and I'm tired at 6.30 in the evening.

267
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,460
-Stiffness in the ankles that you have mentioned last time?

268
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:04,040
-Yes, that's got more because I got some cramps.

269
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:11,890
-About the stiffness I want to know first.
-Yes, in the ankles but all up to here.

270
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,790
-Is it stiffness or cramps?

271
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:22,230
-The stiffness is in the ankles but I feel as if the cramp could come.

272
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,650
-Itching on your nose?

273
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:36,630
-Not so much anymore but I can have it from time to time.

274
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:58,620
-This is perhaps the time where you can take your next remedy.

275
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,970
-I hope so because this warm is really killing me.

276
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:17,130
-And it will be Sulphur 200, a dose of Sulphur 200.

277
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,550
-I like to be well, so it doesn't matter what remedy.

278
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:33,690
-The problem with Sulphur is that maybe your eruptions which have started,

279
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:40,200
the itching and eruptions may become more and that will be a good reaction, don't stop it.

280
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,060
-Yes sure.
