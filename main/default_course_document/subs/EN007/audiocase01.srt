1
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:46,400
Are you aware of this model I have given in my book, which are the 3 levels?

2
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,360
Mental is the deeper one, emotional is the second one

3
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,540
and then the outside level is the physical level.

4
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,360
There are a few things that you have to be aware

5
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:17,110
that once a disease is on this level on the mental level, it may go to the emotional

6
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,860
and eventually to the physical body in this direction.

7
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:33,110
Or if a disease is on a high level on the physical body,

8
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:41,120
then it may come down to another level, which is lower but still is high

9
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,540
and then eventually you may find going into the skin.

10
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:07,040
I want to show you a case where you will see that the child started with a skin eruption

11
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:19,790
eventually developed problems with his chest and then developed problems with his personality.

12
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:32,190
In this case of that child you will see several layers of his body affected.

13
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:42,110
First you will see the mental level and in this particular case

14
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:49,080
what it produces you will be surprised to see a very intelligent child.

15
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,050
A child that has jumped two grades.

16
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:07,120
It's very interesting also that this child on an emotional level,

17
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,880
has stayed very much behind and is immature.

18
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,370
You will say but the child is so clever, why do you say that it's not healthy.

19
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:32,360
No, it's not healthy. It can be stimulated to be very intelligent and it's not healthy

20
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,620
and I'm sure that some of you who have gone through the medical school,

21
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:47,860
especially during the time of examinations, some of you, you may have used amphetamines

22
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,120
and you see how clever you have become during this period.

23
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,110
When the amphetamines are acting, you go and give examinations

24
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:06,220
and you answer your questions with a great clarity and great precision under amphetamines.

25
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:14,860
That means the brain can be stimulated in an unhealthy way, the disease also can go

26
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:20,030
and stimulate the brain and can make a brain that goes zzz...

27
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:25,610
You remember last year when here for those who were present, how many of you,

28
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,790
you were present last year?

29
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:40,530
You remember Zinc? I gave zinc and I was jumping around and I was trying to show

30
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,030
you how is zinc and what zinc is producing?

31
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:58,120
You remember about a mathematician whose brain makes calculations and all these movements

32
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:05,460
and all these twichings which we see and the brain which is working very much.

33
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,450
And you will see it in this child.

34
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,630
And you will see also very clearly the emotional immaturity.

35
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:29,280
You will see this mental over stimulation and the emotional immaturity, combined together,

36
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,880
produce what we call personality disorders.

37
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:50,280
When you will see this child getting better on these levels,

38
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:59,530
you will see his chest will take all the force of the disease

39
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,860
and his asthma will become much more prominent.

40
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:14,360
Why? Because he does not have enough strength to bring out completely on the skin

41
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,800
to bring all the force of the disease.

42
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:44,360
And the child has chest problems and also enuresis, involuntary urination during night

43
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,970
and finally he has skin eruptions.

44
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:02,870
All this added together constitute the disease of the child.

45
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:09,620
When you see the child they bring the child, they will the child has a little bit of eczema,

46
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,460
can you cure it?

47
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:18,800
And you see how complicated is this condition where you see the personality disorders,

48
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:24,310
the chest problem, the enuresis and the eruptions appear at the same time.

49
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,800
Which means that the organism is trying to keep out and some of the disorder,

50
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:36,170
it keeps out in the skin, some it keeps it on the chest, some on the enuresis level

51
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:45,970
and some goes to mental, emotional situation and when under homeopathic treatment

52
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:51,070
how this is reversed.

53
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,970
-A case of a 10 years old boy, his main problem at the moment

54
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:25,470
is that he urinates the bed every night. Maybe even several times in the night.

55
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:31,070
The urine is always very much of it and there is a very strong smell.

56
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:36,330
When he was a baby, he had ...

57
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:41,180
-His main problem is enuresis. He loses urine every night.

58
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:55,370
And this is what the parents feel as a big problem because they have to clean the bed.

59
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:02,520
But is it the main problem? I would like you to tell me if you see the child

60
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,360
how much is the real big problem.

61
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:20,010
-(?) it was very bad when he was about 5 years old and that was the first time

62
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:31,020
he went to homeopath. He gets cracks on the hands and he had it on the knees as well.

63
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,520
Now he is (?) hands sometimes on the face

64
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,510
and he has always got one spot on the left leg and it's itching very much

65
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,860
and he scratches it a lot.

66
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,950
The skin gets very much worse if he drinks milk, he develops big (?)

67
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:53,250
which stick to the clothes, generally also he is worse from milk

68
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,800
and he doesn't have milk now.

69
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:04,910
He also has coughs and wheezing and he wheezes during the night especially in the damp weather

70
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:12,270
he is worse, better in the dry cold. For example on holidays to the mountain.

71
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:20,930
-She mentioned 3 problems, the enuresis, the cracks in the hands and on the face

72
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:26,770
and also the chest problems the wheezing especially in cold wet.

73
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:38,770
The cracks, the wheezing, the worse cold wet indicate a remedy.

74
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:44,300
When we have skin eruptions and chest problem worse cold wet,

75
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:56,390
the remedy can be Dulcamara or Rhus tox or Calcar. carb.

76
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:06,650
But when we have especially cracks, Rhus tox will be in favor of the other two.

77
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:17,630
-In the dark, in the past he had worse during the night at 5 o'clock,

78
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:23,940
mostly at 3 o'clock. He has seen quite a few homeopaths.

79
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:31,170
The first time that he saw me last September they came because he had lots of fears,

80
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:41,130
he had fear of death, fear that the world might end, and very strong fear of the dark,

81
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:47,320
 and fear of robbers and in the night he would wake up crying, he want to die and so on.

82
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,970
-You see how he had developed fear of death, fear of the world coming to an end

83
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,410
that he was dying, he will wkae up in the night, I don't want to die

84
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:07,660
and you see now how the problem is distributed?

85
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,090
The skin, the chest, the enuresis, the fears.

86
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:30,490
-These fears he hasn't got now. His parents always complain about his temperament.

87
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:38,080
He can have very bad mood especially at home that if he doesn't get his way,

88
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:44,590
he hits things and he shouts very loud or slams the door.

89
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,830
So with his parents they have lots of fights, especially with his father.

90
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,320
I haven't seen him like this.

91
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,330
When he came to me he was always very shy and very polite

92
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:01,010
and most of the time he was sitting on his father (?)

93
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:11,810
His father says he can have irrational and violent (?)

94
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:17,960
-You see now the picture how it develops? The child has tantrums, irrational behavior.

95
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:22,790
He will scream without reason, he will do all these things but the child is intelligent.

96
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:28,290
It has jumped two classes. Why he behaves in this way?

97
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:35,140
Why he has developed all these fears? Why he sucks his thumb? He is 10 years old.

98
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:46,830
Why he has enuresis? Now they bring the child to us and say, OK cure this child.

99
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:55,630
What do you want me to do? If it was the skin more prominent, we say cure the skin.

100
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:01,140
If it was the child completely gone, mad, you will see no skin,

101
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:09,200
no problems in the chest, they will say, cure the madness, cure the insanity.

102
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,450
Whatever is the disease!

103
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:19,210
But there is no difference between the skin eruption and the chest eruption

104
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:23,810
and the mind eruption, there is no difference.

105
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:30,210
It's one disturbance that comes or it's diffused to the organism

106
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:39,330
or it concentrates mostly on the mind or mostly on the chest or mostly on the enuresis

107
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:48,260
or mostly on the skin. Where is best to be?

108
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,190
On the skin right?

109
00:14:51,290 --> 00:15:02,450
Then where is next best to be? In the chest. And where is next to be? In the emotions.

110
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,080
And where is next best to be? In the mind.

111
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,940
When the mind breaks down, then it's finished and we have the insanity.

112
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:30,070
-He is very bad tempered in the morning, he is very impatient, he is very proud child,

113
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,070
at school they advanced him, I'm not sure if he jumped two classed

114
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,560
but he is with older children.

115
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,850
He doesn't like it particularly because it means he has to work very hard

116
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,360
to keep up with the others and he likes to be the best and not to work.

117
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,980
His mother complains about him a lot.

118
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:55,560
She says he is very selfish because he tells his friends (?) helps other people,

119
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,420
she says you shouldn't do that.

120
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,360
The other thing is that he always chew something or he chews his fingers,

121
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,900
he always got something in the mouth.

122
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:18,220
His desires there was nothing really marked, maybe his desire for salt.

123
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:32,520
-When I hear this story from the practitioner, I say to myself what is there,

124
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:39,500
what is the remedy, that is in what we are mostly interested. What is the remedy?

125
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:47,770
And I say to myself mostly it can be Rhus tox, perhaps Dulcamara

126
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,500
and these Kalis especially Kali bromatum,

127
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,500
because Kali bromatum has this fear of the catastrophe.

128
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,740
Is it a case of Phosphorus also because Phosphorus has (?) eruption,

129
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,000
wheezing and has fear of dying etc.

130
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:11,000
These are my thoughts going on in my mind when I see the child.

131
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,430
Now you will see something in the child.

132
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:44,520
What did you observe except of those who know the case?

133
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,170
Did anybody observe anything on the child?

134
00:17:52,270 --> 00:18:00,920
Tell me.
-Mouth.

135
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,260
-Who also saw the mouth?

136
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:14,170
That's very important. You see now, as the interview goes on,

137
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:24,910
you see the activity on the mouth, it will keep on going like that all the time

138
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:30,750
and when this activity will stop I will watch his legs

139
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,440
and I will see his legs going like that.

140
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:40,660
Of course I don't remember if they have seen it in the video

141
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:46,410
but as I was next to the child and I could observe,

142
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:54,350
I could observe his legs going like that, when the activity here was calming down.

143
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:02,850
I would like you to observe a little bit more of this child and just see.

144
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,590
-What can you tell us about yourself? What is the problem?

145
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,850
-I can't think of anything.

146
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:42,270
-Are you good student at school?
-Medium.

147
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:52,170
-You like going to school?
-(?)

148
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:58,170
-Are you a quite boy at school or mischievous?

149
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,670
-I become more quiet in school.

150
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,840
-Are you (?) at home?
-Yes, yes.

151
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:23,090
-Very mischievous or just a little bit?
-Probably.

152
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:29,990
-You see the child is moving in two place, he can not do otherwise.

153
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:39,350
These movements are almost chorea type movements. Ticks.

154
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:46,170
But he appears to be playing with that but do you see the activity?

155
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:52,670
It's going on all the time and it is something that we see now

156
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:59,420
that the nervous system is in a state of excitement.

157
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:06,420
The nervous system is on constant irritation, stimulation.

158
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,670
The peripheral nervous system produces all these ticks

159
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,920
and produces also the stimulation in the mind.

160
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:25,420
Are you a good student? Medium. He knows he is supposed to be very clever.

161
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:32,170
Now what I know is that this child has been pushed to the limits by his parents

162
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:42,910
to become, to become, to obtain, learn piano lessons, take French lessons,

163
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,920
learn also Esperado ...

164
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:55,160
I mean whatever the ambition, playing the clarinet, playing this, playing that,

165
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:01,670
being first in the school, you have to be and this stimulates,

166
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:09,170
the nervous system is irritated all the time and then there is a time you say,

167
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,770
Joseph would you come to eat?

168
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:20,080
....  What happened? Why? Of course he behaves this way because he is stimulated

169
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,350
he does not know what is going in his nervous system,

170
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:28,830
he does not feel the balance in himself and therefore he will kick anything,

171
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,260
he will break anything, and the parents will say,

172
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:38,600
the child has a little bit of strange behavior.

173
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:47,750
I mean it's not the fault of the child definitely, neither of the parents per se

174
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:56,340
but the parents do not realize that this kind of behavior needs primarily to be treated

175
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,750
and the child should not be pushed.

176
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,660
This child is exceptional child but should not be pushed,

177
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:11,000
under such pushing do this, do that, the children break up. That is how they break up.

178
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:20,330
I have seen medical students after using a lot of amphetamines

179
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:27,830
to go through their examinations, I have seen them completely broken down eventually,

180
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:32,250
because of over stimulation for a certain period of time, then collapse.

181
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:36,250
I have seen students that they were genius in the high school.

182
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:41,840
They go the University, they go to the College first.

183
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:48,840
The first year in the College and something is wrong, the second year in the College

184
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,690
and they go to the bottom, the third year they give up, finished.

185
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,670
With all that stimulation the very clever, the very intelligent,

186
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:07,750
the brain that is always stimulated does not always indicate a healthy state.

187
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,580
Many times it's an unhealthy state and this is the case with this child.

188
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:20,170
Treated with Homeopathy, this child will go back to his age.

189
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:28,360
He will not be able to keep up with two classes in front of him.

190
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:36,920
There is a sign in this child that indicates an emotional immaturity

191
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,670
and as soon as you see this sign, I would like to raise your hand

192
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:45,920
and I will stop the video and you tell me, this is the sign.

193
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:53,520
As you watch the video, I would like to exercise your powers of observation.

194
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,520
Now that is a sign of immaturity.

195
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:03,520
There is a very clear sign of immaturity, you will see it in the child.

196
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:17,200
-You enjoy being mischievous?
-(?)

197
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:32,700
-What happens in you? You are temperamental?
-I'm angry.

198
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:48,420
-You don't know why. What things make you angry?
-Any excuse will make me angry.

199
00:25:52,680 --> 00:26:00,920
-You see what he says? You observe also, it's almost a chorea state.

200
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:15,080
He says, any excuse I can be angry, that means any excuse to express that imbalance

201
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,830
which is going inside and has to come out to find balance.

202
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:27,900
That's why it says, every symptom that an organism presents is a defense,

203
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:37,240
a way of finding a balance, anything whether it's anxiety, whether it is depression,

204
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:45,930
whether it is movement, whether it is irritability which is expressed, it is to find balance.

205
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:58,680
And he tries to find an excuse to have an eruption, to have an outlet.

206
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,240
-What you do when you are angry? You shout, you swear?

207
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:11,590
-Yes. I slam doors.

208
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,540
-You like to hear the bang of the door?
-Yes.

209
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:25,290
-Have you ever taken things to break?
-No.

210
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,290
-Because you are afraid that maybe your father will punish you?

211
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:38,510
Do you have any fears now? Are you afraid of anything?

212
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:47,660
-The world of growing up.

213
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,900
-Is it a big fear?

214
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,180
-Yes, I used to have last year, I used to have really bad dreams.

215
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,280
-Dreams about the world (?)
-Yes.

216
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:14,320
-You look shy (?) You don't want to grow up, do you?

217
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,310
-No.

218
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,420
-You are afraid of that.

219
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:34,240
You are still thinking of the world growing up.
-Yes.

220
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:40,670
-And you are afraid that you may die?
-Yes.

221
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:55,650
-Fear of death they call it. How is in your mind? How you think about that?

222
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,820
You think that the world is going to blow up and you will die or you may die

223
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,060
because you have a disease?

224
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:09,820
How is the fear?
-I'm scared that I might die.

225
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:19,320
-Yes but when this fear comes? You are thinking of having an accident

226
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:25,570
or a disease and you will die or it just comes out of the blue?

227
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:39,070
-Yes, when I have a bad cough I think I just might die and I can't take a breath.

228
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,070
-Then it feels you may die.

229
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:51,400
Do you feel constricted in your chest?

230
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,400
Do you understand the word constricted?
-Yes.

231
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:02,650
-Like you can not breathe when you have the coughing.

232
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:08,400
-Yes, I can not breathe when I have the coughing.

233
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,500
-How frequent is what he describes?

234
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,910
-The last couple of weeks it could be nearly every night,

235
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:21,490
the coughing continues for long period every night

236
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:27,590
but it might be just once the month or 2-3 times the week.

237
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,160
-When this coughing comes?
-Yes.

238
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:52,760
-The eczema has from 5-6 years old?
-(?)

239
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:06,870
Did you hear what he says, by 5 years old he had badly the eczema, they had to do something.

240
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:12,870
They tried to give allopathic drugs, they could not handle it,

241
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,480
they took it to the homeopath, they gave some medicines,

242
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:23,530
eventually they tried to correct the diet and it appears that the eczema is much less now.

243
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:29,720
Still he has a little bit of eczema, here and there but nothing really serious.

244
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:38,630
Where has gone the eczema? You see the activity with the tongue?

245
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,630
All this activity that is going on all the time?

246
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,230
-It was a time when the eczema was quite strong.
-Yes.

247
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:03,740
-How did it go away?
-We (?) diet specifically.

248
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,530
-Did you give him allopathic medication?

249
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:28,700
-When (?) 2-4 he had a lot of (?) cream and (?) and then

250
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,940
because we couldn't keep the same thing about it,

251
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:40,120
to take more (?) we didn't want to go on like that, so we went to a homeopath

252
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:46,620
and even that didn't have a dramatic effect in curing.

253
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,690
(?)

254
00:32:52,790 --> 00:33:06,880
-But it decreased?
-Not immediately. (?)

255
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,880
Things were very much restricted at the time.

256
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:56,050
-Did he ever have any severe attack of asthma, difficult respiration?

257
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,240
-To my observation it has never been as bad as asthmatic attack can be

258
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:08,340
but in the summer (?)

259
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:24,190
-It's very interesting if you observe now through the follow ups what took place.

260
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,790
Really you will see the differences.

261
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:42,370
He is 10 years old and you may say sometimes logically we explain things.

262
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:46,940
He doesn't put his hand to the mouth because he is in front of the camera,

263
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:57,450
everybody is here. What his organism leads him to do is an awareness.

264
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:02,620
Why don't you put your thumb and suck your thumb?

265
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:18,960
Because you have the awareness not to do it, once the awareness comes, then this will stop.

266
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:31,960
What we do, especially some women what they will do instead of sucking their finger?

267
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:38,060
They will do like that, have you noticed this?

268
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:50,830
It is a kind of ... They don't actually suck their fingers

269
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:56,130
but the awareness of being grown up, the tendency may be still there

270
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,700
but because they have the awareness they can't do it.

271
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,300
Something much more polite and much more acceptable socially.

272
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:40,460
What we are evaluating is the state that the boy is in and why he is in that state

273
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,670
and what is the real cause and then when we will give the right remedy?

274
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:56,120
Certain things have to improve but you will tell me,

275
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,960
is it possible from being immature emotionally, as we see him,

276
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:09,050
the child can be mature emotionally within 3-5 months? That's impossible.

277
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:15,870
Before I knew Homeopathy I would also it's impossible but after I know Homeopathy

278
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:20,120
and what Homeopathy can do, I will not say anymore it is impossible.

279
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,620
I will say yes, it is possible.

280
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:29,880
It is possible that this child will mature in 6 months and he will suck his thumb anymore.

281
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,870
Maybe he will do the same thing as the woman.

282
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:45,960
-To my observation he has never been (?) as much as he can be (?)

283
00:37:46,060 --> 00:38:08,200
or if he has been moving around, he will have very (?) breathing and (?)

284
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:23,580
-You observe the irritability is around his hands now and also I don't remember

285
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:31,760
if they got his feet, the irritability in the feet maybe we'll have a chance to see it.

286
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,900
-Goat milk he can take?
-Yes.

287
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,760
-No problem and he drinks sheep's cheese.

288
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:20,910
-Also another symptom of zinc is that, if you notice, he licks with his tongue.

289
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:29,200
Licking with the tongue, all this activity goes on and also there is this licking

290
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:35,040
with the zinc cases.

291
00:39:51,040 --> 00:40:08,040
He got zinc 200 and I saw this child 2 months later. Put the interview forward.

292
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:32,740
From time to time he remembers that he is sucking his thumb and he takes it out

293
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,330
but in spite of the fact he knows that it's not right to do it, he can not avoid it

294
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:42,170
and he puts his thumb in his mouth.

295
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:54,190
Go to the follow up.

296
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,510
What do you think about his father?

297
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:15,410
The child also, if you have noticed the whole interview, very frequently

298
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:21,180
will turn to the father for help, advice

299
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:26,250
and you see the dependence of the child from the father.

300
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:33,420
You will see the father also is an authoritative figure, he is there, he is closed up

301
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,520
and overwhelms the child.

302
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:19,990
You see in the previous case of Anthracinum that we saw, I said don't touch this case

303
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:31,030
in spite of the fact that it appears to be a new remedy coming up, don't touch.

304
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,380
In this case you will see something else.

305
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:10,030
-I saw his (?) and this is what she said to me. She said he had 4 basic problems

306
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:17,490
which are eczema, asthma, bad temper and enuresis. (?)

307
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:23,990
She said the eczema first, then he came he had some eczema on the fingers,

308
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:27,810
some on the cheeks, some (?)

309
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:39,660
It was very itchy so that his father had to put (?) because he was scratching so much.

310
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:49,640
-When you hear this, you like it. In a case like that, the eczema is becoming worse,

311
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:56,240
you like it but you will like it only if the rest of the child becomes better.

312
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:03,900
Don't always like it. If the rest of the child is better, yes you like it,

313
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,750
you want the eczema to be worse.

314
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,140
-He developed new eczema on the knees and on the other side of the face.

315
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:27,290
It's now starting to get better, the face now is nearly clear, the leg also, the hands are still very bad (?)

316
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:36,140
As for the asthma (?) wanting to take the remedy, he had a really bad night

317
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,150
that he woke up at 2 o'clock in the morning with fear of dying.

318
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:48,160
I (?) someone to stay close to him, the next few days he (?) the asthma

319
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:53,430
and he had to lie down a lot, which is unusual.

320
00:44:53,530 --> 00:45:03,670
one month and the last two weeks he is breathing quite bad, he wakes at 5 am

321
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:11,100
and every morning he has to sit up and cough (?)

322
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:15,080
-Worse 5 a.m.

323
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:24,950
-The enuresis as a whole did not change. The first few days after the remedy,

324
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:37,660
he had a few (?) and now is (?) The temper, she said he might be a little bit less screaming

325
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,760
and a little bit (?) but they are not sure because they have (?)

326
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:50,400
She has become less strict with him. She has taken a stance the other day

327
00:45:52,650 --> 00:46:06,390
until (?) of screaming and swearing. The restlessness is still very great (?)

328
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:13,710
So what she concluded is the eczema is worse, the asthma is too big

329
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:21,350
for the time of the year and enuresis is unchanged and temper is maybe slightly improved.

330
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:27,660
She mentioned two peculiar things. It was very hot weather

331
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,710
and he had asked for a hot water bottle every night to go to bed.

332
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:39,280
-You see the observation of the mother? She noticed two peculiar things.

333
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:45,050
One is that the child became very cold and he asked for hot water bottle.

334
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:49,950
These are changes that came after the remedy.

335
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:56,500
It becomes very important, in order to evaluate what has taken place.

336
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:03,740
So far you may be thinking that the remedy has acted, maybe.

337
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:11,550
It has acted if the child is better in his mental-emotional state

338
00:47:11,650 --> 00:47:22,400
and if he is worse in asthma and skin.

339
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,930
What the mother says, maybe there is amelioration, maybe there is an amelioration

340
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:33,770
in the mental-emotional, the skin was better but it has come back.

341
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:41,790
The enuresis is the same every night and perhaps she says, 2-3 times the night.

342
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:46,020
So there are some changes, between these changes are

343
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:53,000
that the child has become very cold and is strikingly worse

344
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:57,540
because the mother says that's peculiar.

345
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:07,100
-Also he wears his warmest jacket, even in the hottest days and going to town

346
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:11,840
he won't go without his skin jacket.

347
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,620
-He is especially cold in bed?

348
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:28,730
-He seems to be cold also in the daytime because (?)

349
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:55,720
I ask him how are you and he says, I'm worse.

350
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:13,250
-How are you?
-I'm worse.

351
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:22,320
-(?)

352
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:44,680
You can see a few cracks, the dryness, that was much worse of course last year

353
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:49,110
after the initial remedy, as you remember, there was a big aggravation.

354
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:55,670
What you see here is very little. In order that this child will be cured,

355
00:49:55,770 --> 00:50:01,940
one day is going to break out really bad outside on the skin.

356
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:10,030
What has happened is that the remedy affected the child

357
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:16,320
and took the child up to a certain extend. You will see now, the evaluation

358
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,110
that we are doing.

359
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:35,570
-After the remedy the eczema broke out very early?
-Not immediately, coming and going in waves.

360
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:41,460
What you noticed here in the follow up?

361
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,720
Apart from the child, concerning his father giving the follow up,

362
00:50:51,820 --> 00:51:00,790
what you will notice is tha this father is not prepared to accept any change.

363
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:09,520
Anything that I will say, that the medicine has brought about, he will deny it.

364
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:14,500
He will try to say no, no, this is not from the remedy.

365
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:20,430
This has changed but usually this is what happens

366
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:26,790
and everything will be explained away to give you the impression

367
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:32,330
that the remedy has really worked?

368
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:39,490
And it is only my observation concerning the child, that will be your observation.

369
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:42,930
You remember the activity that was going on the muscles?

370
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:50,030
Now you observe to tell me if that activity is going on or the face

371
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,670
has become much more calm now.

372
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,180
You will see in the interview.

373
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:06,190
-When the eczema started?
-About a week I suppose after...

374
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:19,130
-And stayed for how long?
-For 2-3 days (?)

375
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:34,690
Did you see how long is the interview and he has not made one twitch?

376
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,780
The father will keep on saying, nothing has happened.

377
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:51,420
He will try to explain away everything and if you are gullible and if you are not observant,

378
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:56,170
I mean that was the main symptom of course on which we gave Zinc,

379
00:52:56,270 --> 00:53:01,560
but let us say we are not observant, the patient can tell you anything

380
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:07,440
and you can swallow it, you can believe it and then finished.

381
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:17,060
Here, there is a big change and that's very apparent in the face of the child.

382
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:23,240
-The eczema broke out first in the face?

383
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:32,580
-Yes and then on the knees and then on the hands, the fingers.

384
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:52,910
-I see and how was (?) after the remedy?
-A bad one, (?)

385
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:16,720
and then about 2 weeks ago we had a very bad (?)

386
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:24,010
-Two weeks ago he had a crisis of asthma.

387
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:27,580
Did he take anything for asthma?
-No.

388
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,140
-He had fear of dying?
-Yes.

389
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:43,170
-And how is now the condition in the chest? You cough a lot?

390
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:56,800
-I cough (?)

391
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,210
-But it seems coming and going.

392
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,430
-Before the remedy how frequently he would get the asthma?

393
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:24,460
-Very irregular, it depends. This whole year you would expect him (?)

394
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:37,550
it's been less this year than other years (?)

395
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:54,430
Do you observe the activity? He will not shuck anymore his thumb.

396
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:01,490
Both interviews after that, he will no suck his thumb, not only that

397
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:07,140
but when I see the calmness in the face, in comparison with the first one,

398
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:13,210
I know how much the nervous system has been relieved.

399
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:19,540
Never mind what the father is saying and why the father is saying all these things

400
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:26,050
and he does not want changes.

401
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:32,050
The changes are there and they are very prominent.

402
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:43,130
Also he says that the last year the asthma was better than previous years.

403
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:52,090
In proportion that the asthma was better this year, his mental-emotional state is worse.

404
00:56:52,190 --> 00:57:02,940
So when it has starting the amelioration, it's going to go through the asthma to the skin.

405
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:16,430
-Did you notice that certain things that you brought up (?) now did not bother you?

406
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:26,040
-Yes probably (?)

407
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:35,320
(?)

408
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:09,610
-I went down to town (?)

409
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:25,540
-That will be nice.

410
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,560
-Where you put the hot water?
-In my feet.

411
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,690
-Your feet feel very cold?
-Yes.

412
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:41,500
-And this is after the remedy?
-No, this is (?)

413
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,650
-Is it the first time that he feels so cold?

414
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:56,250
-(?)

415
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:04,120
He said, I'm not sure that he is feeling cold, he is just asking for a hot water bottle.

416
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,330
Can you imagine a child that wants to torture himself by putting a hot water bottle

417
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:15,540
the moment that his feet are warm?

418
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:25,070
Later on when he will say, the mother says (?) and this is July 15, middle of July

419
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:37,200
and he takes a warm bottle and he wears little jackets because he feels cold.

420
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:42,580
Now his father will say, I don't know if that is really cold

421
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:52,520
because he likes to wear little jacket. It's very interesting.

422
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:57,660
-(?)

423
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:03,940
-How is his character?

424
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:13,340
-Generally he is better but he has been under so much pressure and (?)

425
01:00:13,830 --> 01:00:17,740
We think maybe he is better, he can not deny the facts,

426
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:22,740
still he tries to explain away everything in order to tell you

427
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:27,820
there is nothing that has taken place. There is no change.

428
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:34,160
That is the condition you have to face many times. Why?

429
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:41,350
Because in a family situation there are things and dynamics that take place,

430
01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:46,170
that are very difficult to change and somebody in a family

431
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:56,090
who takes the responsibility of the family, if this responsibility is not required anymore,

432
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:58,840
it's difficult for him to change.

433
01:00:58,940 --> 01:01:05,840
If he takes an attitude of protectionism towards the family

434
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:13,920
and there is no more need for protection, the mother protects the child, the woman.

435
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:19,670
I have seen grown up women 50-60 years old that they are protected their daughters

436
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:25,920
until the age of 35 and suddenly the daughter becomes grown up

437
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:29,170
and she doesn't need the protection and the mother goes into depression

438
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:31,000
and wants to commit suicide.

439
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:36,610
And says why there is no use for my life?

440
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:50,260
Is it possible that in this condition we may have a family dynamics where he is in control

441
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:58,010
and not only that, maybe there is a possibility that maybe he is

442
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:30,690
a kind of son-father competition towards the mother?

443
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:43,840
The boy has to stay there, where it is, with his weaknesses and complexes and all these things.

444
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:59,840
The picture that the father presents is, nothing has really changed,

445
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:11,350
this is the message I received from the father. What I see is a tremendous change.

446
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:16,610
Not only that but I see also and we will not have time to go into that,

447
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:27,110
I see also that due to the fact there is such sensitivity towards the cold

448
01:03:27,210 --> 01:03:35,110
and due to the fact also that originally when I had the case,

449
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:40,370
I had a lot of Rhus tox symptoms, due to the fact that the restlessness

450
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:46,360
still is somewhat there, not as much it was with the Zinc but still

451
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:52,610
there is some restlessness, the worse cold and the symptoms of initial Rhus tox symptoms,

452
01:03:54,800 --> 01:04:04,290
give me the conviction that the child has gone now into a state of Rhus tox.

453
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:22,360
There is now further from this interview, there is another interview

454
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:27,010
who has come on October, from July to the middle of October,

455
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:29,620
where you will see the next interview.

456
01:04:53,200 --> 01:05:03,850
-Why the father came to the interview?
-I don't know.

457
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:07,600
You will see an interesting phenomenon where the child really gets better

458
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:10,200
the father will not appear anymore.

459
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:33,850
Now what is interesting for me and for you is to understand the dynamics

460
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:39,600
and not to be misled by these dynamics; you have to perceive what is going on

461
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:48,450
for the shake of the child. You are told, help my child.

462
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:58,100
This is what you are asked to do; so never mind how devious in many cases will be,

463
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:04,430
not straight because of these reasons...

464
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:10,460
You will see other dynamics where the person feels, I became by myself well.

465
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:18,090
Homeopathy did not help me, I did it. This idea, I did it, is a dynamic

466
01:06:18,190 --> 01:06:21,100
which will come repeatedly in your consulting room.

467
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,680
They will try to deny any kind of amelioration.

468
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:31,780
They will try to deny and you will sometimes believe it, most of the times.

469
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:38,670
The difference between you and me is perhaps that because of my experience

470
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:46,470
I know what they mean, when they are there, I perceive the real facts.

471
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:51,350
And the real facts for me is that the father was resisting all the time,

472
01:06:51,450 --> 01:06:58,930
apart from feeling the vibrations that were very strong at the moment.

473
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,060
I rely mostly on my observation.

474
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:20,310
Here is the child, he got a dose of Rhus tox 200 or 1M, let us see him.

475
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:47,970
-Are you OK?
-A bit better I suppose.

476
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:51,810
I'm better than I was a few months ago.

477
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:04,970
Isn't very interesting? Now he is coughing and he says (?) and the child says,

478
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:08,510
a bit better I suppose, this is an English answer of course.

479
01:08:08,610 --> 01:08:14,430
The subtle way that the English people are answering the question.

480
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:22,210
He has learned to do that. Let us see how better he is.

481
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:28,350
-Coughing is (?)

482
01:08:28,450 --> 01:08:34,960
(?)

483
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:08,100
There is the follow up which the practitioner gives, I would like to hear that

484
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:10,530
because it's interesting.

485
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:26,000
-The remedy was given at the 20th of July, I saw them on the 1st of September and they were very concerned

486
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:32,330
the cough was very bad and the asthma had become very very bad, worse than it was ever been.

487
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:45,420
Every night he would wake up (?) around 4,30 and again at 6 o'clock

488
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:51,430
(?) very short of breath.

489
01:09:51,530 --> 01:09:55,920
(?)

490
01:10:08,850 --> 01:10:22,350
the enuresis was worse every night (?) I gave him an examination (?)

491
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:31,330
I thought I had to give him something, so I gave (?) 200 and several times (?)

492
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:35,420
After that he asked me for (?) for several days, maybe a week

493
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,170
but then he was back again.

494
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:46,660
Here in this state, the best thing to do is to have an aggravation

495
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:49,910
after a remedy especially in asthma.

496
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:56,990
The best thing to do is never to give a homeopathic remedy to (?) down the aggravation.

497
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:04,340
It's better if you give some helping from allopathic drug.

498
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:14,830
If they can not go through the aggravation. Most probably, if there was no drug available

499
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:19,660
the child would go through the aggravation, without problem.

500
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:25,670
But you know the parents worry and what is important now is that the asthma

501
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:28,000
is worse than ever.

502
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:32,250
The skin is again worse. You see the reaction of the organism

503
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:37,410
that tries to bring down on a lower level the disturbance,

504
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:46,260
which is on the mental-emotional and then eventually bring it down onto the skin.

505
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:53,410
But it does not have enough energy to bring it out to the skin all together.

506
01:11:53,510 --> 01:12:01,020
So it will go through this level of lungs eventually into the skin.

507
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,760
(?)

508
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:28,660
I talked to them again yesterday and I heard that the asthma was now

509
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:35,250
for two weeks quite good. He had a few nights where he (?)

510
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:41,080
His skin is not too bad at the moment, he has (?) on the face

511
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:50,930
and his fingers are covered. He has some eczema on the buttocks, which he never had before.

512
01:12:52,180 --> 01:13:00,830
Enuresis every night except from last week where he had 3 dry nights.

513
01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:03,930
Otherwise he has every night.

514
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:10,000
When you use this follow up, you are sure now that the amelioration

515
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:15,940
on the mental emotional level is going to be very prominent.

516
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:26,520
The last week the amelioration in the enuresis is coming.

517
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:34,660
Previous week 2 nights without enuresis, this week 3 nights without enuresis,

518
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:39,350
the amelioration on this level is also coming.

519
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:49,500
There was an aggravation that affected the chest and the skin and now,

520
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:55,350
as this is going on, the effects of the treatment are apparent.

521
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:06,750
-His temperament improved quite a lot. His mother said he goes to school

522
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:19,350
much more enthusiastic, prepared to work quite hard (?) two days ago (?)

523
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,430
-Are you OK?

524
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:07,920
-I get better I suppose. I'm better than I was a few months ago.

525
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:14,780
(?)

526
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:21,250
-What bothers you most now?
-Coughing.

527
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:50,880
-What hours?
-8,30 in the evening. (?)

528
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:29,460
Do you observe? The hand does not go anymore into the mouth. You see?

529
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:56,370
-Let me see your fingers. The outer body has any eczema?

530
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:03,470
-It's got better.

531
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:17,920
-The eczema where it was before a few months ago? Which places?

532
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:25,780
-My hands are very bad.

533
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:38,070
-Where else?
-(?)

534
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:46,060
-Now the only thing that bothers you is the fingers.

535
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:11,960
Can you tell me about your fears? Do you remember you had some fears?

536
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,010
-Yes.

537
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:23,500
-What they were? Do you remember?
-(?)

538
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,750
-Do you see (?)
-Not that much.

539
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:36,300
-Another fear?
-Fear of dying.

540
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:43,300
-How is that fear?
-No as much.

541
01:18:43,400 --> 01:19:00,190
-Another fear?
-fear of dark.

542
01:19:26,210 --> 01:19:35,540
-Now that doesn't cross your mind?
-(?)

543
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:41,890
-If you hear some noise?
-Yes.

544
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:49,700
-What about your temperament? You were very temperamental?

545
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:57,960
What happened with this aspect of your personality?

546
01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:15,700
-I suppose it got better, it got better for a while and then went back again.

547
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:26,440
-This (?) was when?
-3 months ago.

548
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:30,780
-3 months ago you had a temper?
-Yes.

549
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:51,630
-You did the same thing, you hit things, you shout? (?)

550
01:20:53,090 --> 01:21:02,110
-I still shout... to everybody.

551
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:11,010
-With the same kind of emotions now you shout? You are angry when you shout?

552
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:12,850
-Yes.

553
01:21:21,290 --> 01:21:29,180
-Do you still confront your parents like you did or you don't need to do it?

554
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:32,780
-I think I still do it.

555
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,020
-What do you say?

556
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:49,460
-He is been a lot better, Initially he went through the time of being very angry and shouting

557
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:57,380
and then we had a period of being relaxed In the last couple of weeks,

558
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:03,280
he has been very helpful, very kind.

559
01:22:08,020 --> 01:22:17,180
-This is the improvement that you expect, this is the type of follow up

560
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:19,530
that you like to hear.

561
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:24,760
You don't like to hear that the eczema is gone, you don't like to hear

562
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:27,350
that the chest problem is gone.

563
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:35,180
What you like to hear first is that the temperament is better and then from the inside,

564
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:40,020
the amelioration will take place to the physical, to the external,

565
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:48,450
to the complete amelioration of his skin finally.

566
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:59,850
Unless you have that type of amelioration, this child was treated homeopathically

567
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:10,430
from the age of 5 to the age of 10. What results? His asthma was better

568
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:18,620
and then he said last year was even better but what about his character, his tantrums.

569
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:29,520
He didn't want to do this, I'm sure the child did not feel like doing it purposely

570
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:38,770
but he could not help it and that is where we must concentrate in treating the cases.

571
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:48,100
Always, always you look mental-emotional general state of energy.

572
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:58,930
Mental-emotional better, energy better, wait. Wait until when?

573
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:07,780
Until you are sure that there is a clear picture of another remedy.

574
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:18,350
It's very difficult here because I'm seen this case in London,

575
01:24:18,450 --> 01:24:24,930
I have to fly there to see the follow ups especially and I have to make a judgment

576
01:24:25,030 --> 01:24:28,940
because the whole class attends, says what happened to the child,

577
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:37,700
we want to see and I'm also eager to see that we do not lose time.

578
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:45,600
I could have said, wait until October, until they will come back and wait

579
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:52,420
until I see the effect of the Zinc, the first remedy we gave.

580
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:57,460
Why did I go to the next remedy?

581
01:24:57,560 --> 01:25:06,220
Because first of all I saw an aggravation and then an amelioration.

582
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:12,250
That means an aggravation and then it was an amelioration but the aggravation

583
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:17,610
that was coming in the periphery it stopped, went back.

584
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:24,960
At the same time there are constitutional changes that indicate for me

585
01:25:25,060 --> 01:25:28,170
it is a clear case of Rhus tox now.

586
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:37,510
Because of the changes and pointing now to Rhus tox and if I had seen for instance

587
01:25:37,610 --> 01:25:44,590
that the skin eruption was becoming worse and worse and worse

588
01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:47,610
I would not have given another remedy.

589
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:53,070
But if I kept the child only with Zinc from the beginning,

590
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:59,280
now you would see the same thing as the last interview.

591
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:05,280
That means the action of the remedy Zinc did what it could do, the next remedy appears

592
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:07,830
and it's clear, you can give it.

593
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:13,920
Why? Because the child is still quite a lot sick.

594
01:26:16,670 --> 01:26:23,330
The mother comes and says, well there is definitely an improvement in his temperament

595
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:27,170
his character, there is no question about that.

596
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:32,410
That is where you want to lead your patient.

597
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:37,920
That is not apparent, you can not see it like a skin eruption,

598
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:42,240
where the skin eruption goes away and you are very happy, you see it's going away.

599
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:53,270
You cannot see the eruption in the mind but what you see is the hyper excitability

600
01:26:53,370 --> 01:27:01,030
that expresses itself through disorders in his personality.

601
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:05,780
You see that he became a sweet child and he is going to be a sweet child,

602
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:09,520
it's a very nice child, there is no question about that.

603
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:14,780
He is not going to be as bright as he used to be, there is no question about that

604
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:25,690
and he is going to go through with his chest and skin problems for some time

605
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:31,280
before everything appears in the skin.

606
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:40,270
He may need another dose perhaps but at the moment we leave the child.

607
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:45,610
It's good enough. Now the fact he starts going to the school

608
01:27:45,710 --> 01:27:50,780
where the situation is aggravated, when he starts going to school,

609
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,290
then he becomes very agitated.

610
01:27:54,390 --> 01:28:05,540
Then he had some reaction but always the improvement takes this kind ...

611
01:28:28,710 --> 01:28:34,790
You see here it comes down for a period of time and goes up again a little bit down,

612
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:41,190
more down you wait and you will see again up.

613
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:45,910
On the whole observing the child in a period of 6 months,

614
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:52,410
you will see the upward tendency of the child, his health picks up constantly

615
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:54,170
and this is the idea.

616
01:28:54,270 --> 01:29:03,240
From time to time you will see some kind of relapses or they will look like relapses.

617
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:09,030
But once the remedy has acted correctly from the inside to the outside,

618
01:29:09,130 --> 01:29:15,090
don't bother, these relapses are only temporary and they will go away.

619
01:29:34,590 --> 01:29:49,160
The Carbo vegetabilis acted partially. What it does is it takes away one symptom

620
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:55,910
or part of the case and ameliorates it for a week or 3-5 days

621
01:29:56,010 --> 01:30:02,760
and then the child descends back, that means it did nothing. It was close but not exact.

622
01:30:06,770 --> 01:30:17,490
It could have spoiled the case if this child was in a much worse situation.

623
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:22,850
His immune system, his defense mechanism was very much lower.

624
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:27,360
One dose of the wrong remedy, it could have done

625
01:30:27,460 --> 01:30:42,420
that the asthma could have been ameliorated immediately and then his nervous state

626
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,720
would have been aggravated.

627
01:30:50,710 --> 01:30:57,580
If you repeat it untimely, you may have opposite results than what you expect.

628
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:10,870
If now he comes 3 months later after Rhus tox and I don't see anymore the coldness.

629
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:17,410
When it was July his father was telling me that he likes to wear his leather jacket.

630
01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:21,420
Why doesn't he come with leather jacket on October in London,

631
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:24,920
which is much colder than July?

632
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:34,250
But if you give now again Rhus tox, most probably will aggravate the case

633
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:36,850
without an amelioration.

634
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:56,750
His thumb is in the mouth, you will see it sometimes will go like that

635
01:31:56,850 --> 01:32:01,510
but never really sucks his thumb again and that was one symptom

636
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:05,250
that was related from the beginning.

637
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:17,020
The mother says he sucks his thumb. Why now he does not suck his thumb after the remedy?

638
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:23,110
What is the difference? It's accidental or he got more mature

639
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:27,360
within the last 2 months or something? No.

640
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:30,610
I believe it's the remedy that brings about that kind of maturity

641
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:36,110
that let the freedom of the organism to develop and that's why the child

642
01:32:36,210 --> 01:32:44,960
has the awareness not to suck his thumb.

643
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:28,940
That is the problem really. Once it comes to that state, we are going to have a problem

644
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:33,950
because the mother will press, the father will press, the child will press for a remedy

645
01:33:34,050 --> 01:33:40,030
and we do not know what is the next indicated remedy.

646
01:33:40,130 --> 01:33:47,790
Is still Rhus tox, is Calcarea, is one complementary remedy, is Bryonia, Dulcamara?

647
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:53,030
What is it? And we are going to be in a bad situation.

648
01:33:53,130 --> 01:34:00,370
There is a stage where we are going to find difficulty in handling this case,

649
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:03,200
as the case progresses better and better.

650
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:14,190
Unless the parents understand the real improvement and what we mean by improvement.

651
01:34:14,290 --> 01:34:19,790
We mean that the child will be really balanced in his organism in general.

652
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:23,710
Unless they understand that, we are going to have a problem.

653
01:34:26,050 --> 01:34:31,530
Now it's a different thing when this child will come eventually with a big skin eruption.

654
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:38,860
It's different if he had come initially with a skin eruption to me;

655
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:46,630
we may have to wait for 5,6,8 months, 1 year before we can spot the next remedy.

656
01:34:58,710 --> 01:35:06,610
I have been in that situation many times and I have been forced and pressed

657
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:13,360
and I made mistakes many times; that's why I warn you now, be careful,

658
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:17,290
don't be in a hurry to prescribe.

659
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:27,450
There was a time when they press me for a remedy and the remedy appeared to be Phosphorus.

660
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:33,690
The child would stay awake the whole night, scratching and the parents would scratch

661
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:36,790
and they would go mad the whole family.

662
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:47,190
It was Roger Morrison, he had the case. On the telephone day, night, evening.

663
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:50,950
And then he was telephoning me, what is going on?

664
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:56,690
And I said, OK let me see the child and I see the child, it was in a terrible state,

665
01:35:56,790 --> 01:36:01,450
we can't wait anymore. 15 days now nobody had slept.

666
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:10,950
The child scratches and the remedy appeared to be Phosphorus but I was not very happy,

667
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:16,700
I was not 100% sure. I said I'm going to make a mistake if I give Phosphorus.

668
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,290
I said no, forget it, don't give it.

669
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:25,200
He said, they are going to put cortisone, they can not stand it anymore.

670
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:33,530
I said Roger, if we do it, I don't want to make a mistake, wait.

671
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:42,030
The next day the child changed the picture of Phosphorus to Arsenicum.

672
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:50,030
But when it changed to Arsenicum, it was so clear Arsenicum with the fear of  death,

673
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:56,580
with sipping water, with coldness, they had to cover the child.

674
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:59,440
I said, yes Arsenicum now give it.

675
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:04,500
You wouldn't believe it, it was crying.

676
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:15,510
They were holding him, it was a serious condition, they couldn't sleep

677
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:24,500
and I could understand all that but we gave Arsenicum in the evening.

678
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:29,350
In the night the child slept right through.

679
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:36,500
You would see his whole body was covered with eruption.

680
01:37:38,690 --> 01:37:43,580
He did not know where to scratch, he was scratching and bleeding, he had a lot of wounds.

681
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:51,660
Within 48 hours you wouldn't believe the change. The skin was coming to normal.

682
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:55,600
48 hours and the boy get well.

683
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:04,000
If I had given Phosphorus, everybody would feel sorry, not only me.

684
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:08,750
Roger, the father, the mother, cortisone would be definite.

685
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:12,000
Because Phosphorus could not have helped the child

686
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:14,500
but it was so clear picture of Phosphorus,

687
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:19,250
drinking water, fear of the dark and wants his parents all the time there.

688
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:25,000
Roger pressed me, that's a Phosphorus case and I said, no it's not,

689
01:38:25,100 --> 01:38:30,600
it is an experience of course that you have to differentiate between subtle differences

690
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:34,340
but for me there was not strong Phosphorus case

691
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:39,930
and I knew what a wrong remedy can do in that state.

692
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:48,340
I said, no still wait and then when it became really aggravated,

693
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:52,760
then the picture of Arsenicum became very apparent.

694
01:38:56,520 --> 01:39:01,420
I know the problems with skin eruptions, they are terrible

695
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:09,920
but if you imagine the same skin eruption in the brain,

696
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:12,270
it's better I have it in the skin.
