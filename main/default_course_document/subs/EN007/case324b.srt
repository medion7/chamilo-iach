1
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:36,060
-Let his father tell us what happened after Veratrum album 10M.

2
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,390
-Already in the days here, on the island, there was a slight amelioration.

3
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:47,780
Mr. Vithoulkas said we would have to wait up to 3 months to see a definite amelioration.

4
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:56,110
After 3,5 months concerning my opinion there was a definite amelioration of the vomiting.

5
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,950
Before he was vomiting from 6-9 times per day, he is going to describe it by himself,

6
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,630
but I think it went down to a 1/3 of what it has been.

7
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,030
During the last weeks, I didn't perceive it myself, I'm not so much together with him

8
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,800
so he is going to tell what is really going on.

9
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:28,280
-What about his height. Did he put on some height?

10
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,970
-I don't really know, I actually don't measure myself.

11
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:39,700
-But we have to know about that because we know the height before treatment.

12
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:48,050
I think he is at least 5 cm more. Yes we can measure him.

13
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:58,830
How high was before?
-1 m 43cm.

14
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:15,900
-He must tell us how is the last month.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,230
-There is definitely a clear amelioration and my vomiting is about one time per day

16
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:33,330
and about 4-5 times per week I can go for stool, to the toilet.

17
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,170
And I actually I would prefer to get definite questions from you.

18
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:05,670
-Very good. During that time did he have any epistaxis?

19
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,990
-On Sunday and since Sunday he had twice epistaxis but otherwise,

20
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,340
at home is not so often.

21
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,150
-What his father says?

22
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,900
-I found it very remarkable that during the 5 months it was every now and then

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,400
but since he is here on the island it was twice, a very strong nose bleeding

24
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:42,750
from the right nostril and it was with clots in it and a lot, big quantity.

25
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:57,070
-Also we must tell the class that I had asked for Veratrum 50M but we could not get

26
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:04,920
and he took 10M. I want to know if he still bites his nails.

27
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,170
-I don't know, I don't realize myself.

28
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,420
-But he most probably does.
-Yes it could be.

29
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:34,420
-I see him quiet where before he had restless while sitting, quite a lot.

30
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,570
Does he remember this, he has noticed this?

31
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,570
-Yes I do remember.

32
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:47,010
-Now this is better?
-Yes.

33
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:58,390
-Concerning his constipation, he said 4-5 times per week, before how much it was?

34
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,820
-I would say 3-4 times. Before he could go every second day and

35
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,750
now it's more frequent.

36
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,090
About 50% amelioration.

37
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,790
-He says, I would consider not 50% amelioration.

38
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:26,660
-What about his coldness, he said his hands are very cold, how is that?

39
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,980
-In winter is still very extreme but he agrees I don't shiver so much

40
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,170
because you can't really compare to Germany.

41
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,660
-In Germany it was the same as before?

42
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:50,920
-It was the same like half a year ago, feeling cold that was even before.

43
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,320
-He had complained about pain in the forehead.

44
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,920
-It's still there every now and then.

45
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:19,240
-Does people in his class still tease him or he is affected by them

46
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,740
or he doesn't care so much?

47
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,490
-The new younger people are coming is all right for the moment because

48
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:34,410
they are sometimes even smaller than me. So he isn't the smallest anymore.

49
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:41,410
Before he was the smallest child of the whole high school and now this is changed

50
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,670
because younger people came.

51
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:59,320
-What about his thirst? He drinks quite a lot still, cold water?

52
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:05,860
-In Germany I drink either room temperature or warm drinks but here in Greece

53
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,340
I would take ice cold drinks.

54
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,150
-Ask his father.

55
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:18,240
-I observe that in Germany he orders a soda with ice cubes he takes the ice cubes

56
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,420
and eats them.

57
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,010
-Is that true?
-Yes but only when I feel bored.

58
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:45,170
-Have you noticed any change in your desire for food, you like more this or that?

59
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,840
-I can't tolerate the fat still.

60
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:24,590
-How is he doing in his class?
-I'm one of the better students.

61
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:41,490
-What I would like to see is to measure his height and then we go inside.

62
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,320
-There is still certain restlessness left over, it's about 50% better

63
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:02,580
but still when he is eating he can't sit still, he is moving his feet

64
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,370
and wanting to play football. It's not that he can't stand still at all,

65
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:11,930
he can sit still for 3 min and then he starts moving.

66
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:24,580
-It's interesting question for me also that you see some action of the remedy

67
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:31,270
and you feel that it's not good enough.

68
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:41,350
And I wonder whether the 50M really was needed.

69
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:59,510
Still he is good enough but he could be better, if we had a stronger impulse.

70
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:15,660
And now  we have the same problem that we have in most of the cases.

71
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:30,020
What shall we do? What is the situation? Shall we now go to 50M?

72
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,360
Let his father talk, maybe he didn't say something important .

73
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:44,420
-I didn't want to embarrass my son or bring him any problems in front of the public

74
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,670
but according to my observation the vomiting has ceased completely within

75
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,760
the last 1 and 1/2 months.

76
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:59,510
Before he vomited 9 times the day and what, in my opinion, speaks strongly for Veratrum

77
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,680
is that he repeatedly had this epistaxis from the right nostril.

78
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,980
But he still has a certain restlessness, for example he loves to play

79
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:20,670
with his game boy for 3-4 hours every day and he likes to eat ice cubes.

80
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:36,390
-In this case we see the keynotes of our prescribing, they are still there.

81
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:44,810
What is interesting is, he says in the last days the epistaxis on the right side

82
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:53,810
on which we had actually based a lot of the prescription is back definitely,

83
00:11:53,910 --> 00:12:02,400
the coldness which is another keynote,  there is icy coldness on extremities,

84
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:09,740
especially the hands and that is why Veratrum will be indicated

85
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,580
very frequently in rhino cases.

86
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:28,400
What is interesting for you to learn concerning the Materia Medica of Veratrum is this.

87
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:41,080
When the Veratrum goes through grief, a usual reaction is vomiting.

88
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:58,230
The outlet of the organism is to vomit and to vomit easily and that is why

89
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:08,080
we say Veratrum vomits like a rocket, it comes out very easy and forcefully.

90
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:19,570
There is a tendency of the Veratrum to vomit very easily to go into diarrheas very easily

91
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:29,660
and that is why also Veratrum will be indicated in cases of cholera,

92
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,730
but you don't have to have cholera, you have to have a similar type of food poisoning

93
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:41,570
which you may see mostly vomiting and diarrhea.

94
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:47,070
Once you see this then your mind immediately should go to Veratrum,

95
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:54,910
especially if they complain about coldness in the body and especially the hands.

96
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:09,320
So it's a good learning experience, also it is something for you to remember.

97
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:17,320
When you have a deep grief and symptoms because of deeper grief,

98
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:27,570
don't expect the organism to react immediately, it will take some time,

99
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,010
just give time and wait.

100
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:38,090
If you have decided on a remedy, after you have studied well the case.

101
00:14:46,540 --> 00:15:27,780
What shall we do? What the class says? About wait, repeat, go higher, go lower?

102
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:51,030
Again the problem is that he comes here at this time and you have to make a decision.

103
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,600
You don't have the possibility to say, come after a month, two months etc.

104
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:01,050
so I can evaluate the situation and decide accordingly.

105
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,120
1 cm per month is this good enough?

106
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:36,370
Anyhow I was writing 5 cm higher than what he was when I saw him. That's the idea.

107
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:45,880
What the pediatrician would say, ask her in his age what is the rate?

108
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:55,540
-Generally you can't really tell because they have this time of going up quickly

109
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:03,020
at some age between 12 -18, even later but in his case I also would expect

110
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,960
with the 50M to go much quicker. It's slow for his age.

111
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:21,710
-What is his age at this moment?
-14 years old.

112
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:34,280
-As I said last time, all the children who take homeopathic treatment from young age

113
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,210
if the treatment is correct, they become taller than their parents.

114
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:48,950
So at least he should go over his father. I don't know his mother.

115
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:19,280
-I want to ask if for the next month this epistaxis would become more and let us say that

116
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:32,880
the vomiting will not reappear. I think that we should repeat then. What do you think?

117
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:53,810
-The problem is when to repeat? Now, to give another dose of 10M or we just go 50M

118
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,630
and let him vomit again for a few days.

119
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:21,360
It's a difficult decision. The symptomatology is there for Veratrum album still.

120
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:30,610
If he relapses, that means if he is going to relapse, he is maybe going to start vomiting

121
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,970
again after some time.

122
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:48,870
-I had asked him to measure his size in between and then he always said,

123
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:54,450
no I don't want to, he did not want to be confronted with this issue.

124
00:19:54,550 --> 00:20:01,050
So from that I assumed that he has still a high sensitivity concerning this issue.

125
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,780
-Because what I was thinking is that if the grief problem would have been resolved

126
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,530
and it would be only on the physical, if we could lower and repeat

127
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:18,880
but if it's still on the mental we should go higher.

128
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:25,780
-No, this is a case where we have to go higher in any case, we have to go either repeat

129
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:39,530
or go higher. Now the grief how much better it is? In this particular case it is proportional

130
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,470
to the vomiting.

131
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:49,610
The grief corresponds to the vomiting, so if you see the vomiting goes all together

132
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:56,110
then there is going to be a residue left but very little beyond the vomiting.

133
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,530
That means the grief is so much that causes this repulsion.

134
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:13,370
Once this is gone some grief will be staying over which may take a few months or years

135
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:21,210
to resolve it totally once he feels back again that he is normal

136
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,960
and he is like all the other children.

137
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:31,210
-Last year still on September-October there was a kind of idiosyncratic aversion

138
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,130
against any small tiny amount of fat.

139
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,870
It has to be no butter, no any amount of fat anywhere.

140
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:45,330
He would refuse totally to eat it and by now you can offer him dishes

141
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,540
that have been made in the frying pan with a little butter underneath to prepare the food

142
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,870
and he would eat it, so I would say the aversion against fat has reduced by 10%

143
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,640
of what it had been.

144
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,290
-There was an arrested development definitely.

145
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:12,870
This arrested development would not bother the child unless the other children

146
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:18,620
have tease him about his size.

147
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:28,370
So it's not the arrested per se which affected him but the teasing of the other children,

148
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:35,540
you are dwarf or whatever. They tease him and the grief was imprinted in him

149
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,720
because of the teasing of the other children.

150
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:53,710
Now there is some anger, maybe I don't see the anger. I still can see and hear

151
00:22:53,810 --> 00:23:01,120
in his voice when the matter was discussed for a while, I can hear the sensitivity

152
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,730
towards that matter.

153
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:14,460
If you could hear his voice changed a little bit, that shows that there is a residue

154
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,380
and the residue is going to stay, not all the grief will go away.

155
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:32,480
If we have so much grief, if it goes over this level starts

156
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:38,220
causing vomiting in Veratrum children.

157
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:46,460
So if this grief starts coming down here, it will leave the child without vomiting

158
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:54,460
and of course better assimilation because the vomiting is not just a vomiting.

159
00:23:54,560 --> 00:24:02,560
It is bad assimilation, if he vomited 9 times the day, there is a problem of course.

160
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:12,050
The organism rejected what he was eating, so the whole idea that

161
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:22,210
we corrected his assimilation of food, as a result reducing as well the grief

162
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:34,050
and at the same time giving him the possibility to grow a little bit more,

163
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,150
so he is not teased so much by the other children.

164
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:46,380
-This is a general question about treating children.

165
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,630
Since they are usually attached to the parents and live together,

166
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:57,220
to what extend would you enquire about the essence, about the character of the parents

167
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,880
and how they influence about this interrelation, what extend according to age or

168
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,070
what would you enquire?

169
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:13,220
-Not very much, it is true that, what my experience is, you give the correct remedy

170
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:19,210
and it will correct the child and correct even the misbehavior of the parents.

171
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:24,210
Because the parents sometimes do not understand that the behavior of the child

172
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:30,970
is due to some pathology. If the child is restless and they say, you don't stay

173
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:36,720
in one place, you just sit down and don't move and the child does not understand

174
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:45,560
he is restless even and then of course the parents can create problem.

175
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:52,550
But if you give a remedy which corrects the restlessness, then the parents stop doing this.

176
00:25:52,650 --> 00:26:02,390
So what I found out is that the dynamics in the family are more or less rearranged in

177
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:13,880
some matters especially, so the behavior of the parents is modified but in this case

178
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:25,720
I did not see any problem at all, even to think of some kind of wrong behavior on the

179
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,320
part of the parents.

180
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:33,360
-I'm not referring to this case of course but sometimes the whole problem start

181
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:43,550
from some projection of the parents on the child, so it might happen again and again.

182
00:26:43,650 --> 00:27:00,970
-Yes, that is true but for instance you remember a case we saw together from Israel

183
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:06,740
a lawyer with tremendous headaches?

184
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:21,480
I believe this is a case created quite a lot by the pressure of the parents that

185
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:33,220
the child becomes really something and his spine was like this and then the headaches

186
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:40,570
and then we predicted that this is going to be very difficult case.

187
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:48,240
It was difficult, I have been treating still the case and he is doing better.

188
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:05,300
My experience is that these children, very short children from very short parents also

189
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,560
with homeopathic treatment, they become much taller.

190
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:19,900
I've told you parents of 1,50 m both 1,50 m they are almost like this child

191
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:31,970
and they brought the son for chorea. The son at the year of 10-11 he started jumping around

192
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:40,580
and we treated him for at least 3 years before we could manage to cure his chorea.

193
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:46,750
For 4 years. So he was 15-16 by the time he stopped.

194
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:54,390
This boy became a football player and he was one of the tallest in the team.

195
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:07,150
He became over 1,85 m, all the children I have seen.

196
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:14,350
So you have to know if you treat your child with Homeopathy is going to become very tall

197
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,200
have that in mind.

198
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:30,000
The decision is one dose of Veratrum album 50M.

199
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:47,250
-The last time we were here my son received Veratrum album in a C50.000,

200
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,450
that was on May this year, it was the second dose of the remedy;

201
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:54,210
before he had received it in a 10M.

202
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:01,530
His main complain was a sudden, severe, violent, projectile vomiting

203
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,460
which could happen 6-9 times every day.

204
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:12,190
After Veratrum 10M the frequency vomiting was reduced but it was still there constantly

205
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:19,200
every day 4-6 times. And now reporting what happened after taking Veratrum 50M

206
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:25,610
which he received in May of this year, according to his words in the past 4-5 months

207
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:29,460
he still vomits about 1-2 every day.

208
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:35,110
But he doesn't have any mental or emotional complain from it, he doesn't really care

209
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,810
and he also is not nauseous or has any other physical complain with it.

210
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:44,350
I think one of the reason why George Vithoulkas prescribed Veratrum among the many

211
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:49,610
vomiting remedies we have is that my son has a very specific bleeding from

212
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,240
the right nostril during the night, epistaxis.

213
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,520
So I tell you now the new symptoms that have developed since, vomiting as I said

214
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,530
had remained in low frequency.

215
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:06,280
What changed now is that the epistaxis from the right nostril got so severe

216
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,900
that every time it happened he needed between 4-5 handkerchiefs just

217
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,290
to collect the amount of blood coming out of his nose.

218
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:20,400
The blood was bright red but the frequency of the epistaxis has reduced quite a lot

219
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:26,390
in the last 3 weeks, he told me it happened once or twice.

220
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:32,700
What appeared new in August, when I was here on the island with my wife

221
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:38,900
to consult Mr. Vithoulkas, had inflicted a small wound on his elbow

222
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,840
while was playing football with me.

223
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,070
This wound was not healing properly, so one evening we went to the local pharmacy here

224
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:52,070
in Patitiri and then they put some kind of liquid, I think it was iodine

225
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:57,340
or something else into the wood and also applied a certain spray over it

226
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:04,820
and when the pharmacist put the spray on the wound, from one moment to the next,

227
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:08,420
my son suddenly fell over to the side.

228
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:14,410
I just managed to grab him and he was lying there on the ground collapsed,

229
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:22,000
he was conscious but he really collapsed from one second to the next.

230
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:45,900
-It was his height, he would not grow and then it was a problem for him

231
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:56,230
especially psychological problem because he would feel he was very short in his class.

232
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,070
How is that developing?

233
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:05,480
-There is no grief anymore concerning his height but he won't let us measure his height

234
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:11,840
he doesn't want it. Usually he refuses us to take his height.

235
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,250
-What is his impression?

236
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:28,080
-2-3 cm within the last 5 months but I have no chance of measuring it.

237
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:37,350
He continues to bite his nails down to the flesh and he still is constipated,

238
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:42,070
he only has stool every second day and I had a phone call with him in the meantime

239
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:49,660
to make precise report and he confirmed that after every stool,

240
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,250
he has a real prolapse of the rectum.

241
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,000
He has some aversions and desires, he developed some aversion to meat and

242
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:07,900
he likes to eat chocolate, not that strong, you maybe underline it twice

243
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:13,990
and he has an aversion to butter, he would rather not use butter at all

244
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:17,750
or very, very thin on his bread.

245
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,990
-He used to take butter?

246
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,590
-No, he always had an aversion to butter. It's not a change.

247
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:35,080
He still complains of very cold hands, he always says his hands are colder than his feet

248
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:43,760
and I asked him how they are and he says, icy cold even now in August and September.

249
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,850
-Prolapse in children, show me this?

250
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:03,580
Podophyllum, show me the analysis.

251
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:21,240
Yes! Because I thought maybe I start having an anxiety with the Podophyllum

252
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,100
jump into the picture.

253
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,750
-I forgot to mention that he has very strong thirst for large quantities

254
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:34,430
and I asked him on the phone whether he prefers cold drinks or hot drinks and he said,

255
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,780
cold from the fridge.

256
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:52,960
-We are very happy if the information is so, if the information is reliable

257
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:03,370
because immediately with the sudden collapse, with the excessive bleeding

258
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:10,730
you just put the two things together and you have a case of Phosphorus

259
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:23,130
but you just give one dose of Phosphorus 200, that's all and I would like that

260
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:30,870
in one year he picks up 20 cm.
-OK.

261
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:33,800
-Not 2-3 cm.

262
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:41,910
-I would like to say a word in front of the auditorium I want to thank you very, very much.

263
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:47,220
There is hardly anybody who has done so much for the health of my family as you.

264
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:13,720
-What is his height at this moment?
-At this moment I measured 1 m and 58 cm.

265
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:31,470
-And it was when we measured it here, do you remember what it was his height?

266
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:59,150
-1 m 48 cm one year before when we started. So there is 10 cm more.

267
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:10,470
-And in every other respect he is going to school, he has no problems?

268
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:22,200
-No, I don't think there is a grief when other boys hurt him, he was the smallest boy

269
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:31,040
in the whole school, now he has grown up and this problem I don't think is really

270
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,800
a problem for him.

271
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,890
-So his height is almost normal now.

272
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:53,360
-He is in the lower border but I should go to an endocrinologue to check.

273
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,450
-I don't think anything will be found at this moment and I believe he will have

274
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:09,300
a completely normal height, if not too high.

275
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:20,320
-He is now 15 years and has no real signs of puberty. I was also late in development.

276
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:32,810
-I don't think you will have a problem, we'll watch.

277
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:52,970
10 cm in a year, if is going to be every year, another 5 years that he still can grow

278
00:39:53,070 --> 00:40:06,800
he will go into 2 m and 10 cm. It will be no problem with his height because I believe

279
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:15,050
the pituitary gland was arrested in the development but now it is released.

280
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:21,300
I know this because many, many children who do Homeopathy they grow to be much higher

281
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:29,060
than their parents, so he definitely can be taller than you.

282
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,130
-So he can be confident.

283
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:40,290
-You can be confident, he will be taller than you, I don't know how much but definitely

284
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:48,630
you will remember this in a few years and maybe one time you bring him here

285
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,730
and I measure him again with you.
