1
00:00:01,904 --> 00:00:12,896
Those who had seen a case of a young girl from Austria 4-5 years old with menses...

2
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:21,536
Who has seen this case? Last year you have seen this case.

3
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:50,468
It’s called pubertas praecox syndrome,

4
00:00:53,636 --> 00:01:01,708
that means a very premature developing of the human body

5
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:12,084
where the woman develops at the age 4, 5 except of menstruation,

6
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:19,459
hair and all these signs of a grown up woman.

7
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:27,467
This is considered a very difficult to treat situation

8
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:42,083
and I think in this girl was tried several hormones.

9
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,611
Where is the doctor attending the case? Can you please come?

10
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:51,676
She knows what happened with the case. Unfortunately as I said,

11
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:58,843
when people get better they say goodbye George, we don’t need you anymore.

12
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:20,748
The case number is 618 and the remedy was... So tell us what happened.

13
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:32,915
– The first time we have been here in 2006, we started with the case

14
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:40,340
and in this year we showed you the case in general and you gave Med.

15
00:02:41,308 --> 00:02:47,108
– Last year?
– No, 2006.

16
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:52,979
After this the symptoms were just a little bit better but not so obviously

17
00:02:54,716 --> 00:03:08,995
and the next year she got Lach., in 2007. In 2008, last year, she got Phos.

18
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:13,931
– And what happened with the last remedy?

19
00:03:18,244 --> 00:03:24,132
– After Phos. as the father said she got warmer.

20
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:33,011
She had such tremendous fits of rage, beating around,

21
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:36,307
beating against furniture, beating her mother.

22
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:41,164
That was all less and she grew up more normal.

23
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:44,843
And the father says that she was more childish.

24
00:03:45,507 --> 00:03:54,595
Before as you remember she was in the mood to talk about boys at the age of 6.

25
00:03:55,283 --> 00:04:02,419
It was like puberty signs.
– What about the menstruation? The growing of hair?

26
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:06,316
– This was from the beginning suppressed by the hormonal injections

27
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:10,563
and as you remember the father is himself a medical doctor

28
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:16,196
and he was forced by the law to give these hormonal injections.

29
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:21,788
That was his fear that she gets the hormonal injections and he cannot stop it.

30
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:29,922
– What are the hormonal injections?
– It’s hormones.

31
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:37,649
– He stopped the hormones?
- She got the hormonal injections; he had to do this.

32
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:45,026
From the law. This professor in Vienna... They forced him to do this

33
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,746
because the law says she must get this school medicine treatment.

34
00:04:50,546 --> 00:04:54,226
– So what did he do?
– He did this...

35
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,530
- Because of the law.

36
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,585
– And you told him that he should not tell the professor in Vienna

37
00:05:01,106 --> 00:05:14,226
that we do another thing also. The hormonal injections only suppressed the menses

38
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:24,297
and the pubic hair but her general behavior and the general symptoms did not go away

39
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:31,482
and we saw that the case was bad, although the hormonal injections.

40
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:35,634
Maybe it brought some result in the menses and the pubic hair

41
00:05:36,122 --> 00:05:45,506
but it didn’t heal the case. 
Every half year they measured the bones

42
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:54,731
so you can see on the bones, if they are growing like in the age of 14 or of 6.

43
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:06,834
Before the bones were growing like in a 13 year old girl.

44
00:06:08,522 --> 00:06:13,082
Now the bones are growing like a 6-7 year old girl.

45
00:06:15,027 --> 00:06:27,362
– The effect of this syndrome is that the girl does not grow according to her age,

46
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:35,578
it grows according to the age let’s say 13 or 14.

47
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:46,314
That means the growing instead of being of 6 to 18, it is from 14 to 18,

48
00:06:46,978 --> 00:06:52,177
that means the girl will stay very short in the end.

49
00:06:53,290 --> 00:07:01,378
Because it stops the growth of the skeletal system.

50
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:13,737
If we manage to first of all to counteract the mental symptoms

51
00:07:14,202 --> 00:07:18,986
that were created by suppressing the hormones when the girl was mad,

52
00:07:19,426 --> 00:07:25,674
hitting, doing all these kind of things. Because if the hormones are there

53
00:07:26,114 --> 00:07:32,818
and the organism is producing them and you enter with other hormones to stop,

54
00:07:33,474 --> 00:07:36,217
that means there is a fight inside the organism,

55
00:07:37,178 --> 00:07:42,362
and of course the girl naturally was very aggressive.

56
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:44,873
She wanted to express this aggression.

57
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:51,258
If the remedies managed to bring her to a normal state...

58
00:07:53,226 --> 00:08:00,730
- Her age fitting stage.
– But what is her father saying about Homeopathy?

59
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:05,196
– He was open from the beginning because he is a close friend of mine.

60
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,642
He was open from the beginning and searching for help.

61
00:08:10,362 --> 00:08:15,290
– But will he come here and give a report for his daughter?

62
00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:20,385
This is what I am interested in. Will he come?

63
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:24,609
– If he will come again?
– Yes.

64
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:31,602
– Yes, he will come again next year.
– Bring the daughter and show us.

65
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:34,187
– He also wanted to come this year but I wrote you an email

66
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:39,699
and you wrote back that this is not necessary if everything is really good.

67
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:57,098
– Ok, I am too good! Everything is really well. I have to answer 50 emails a day.

68
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:02,634
I read that the case is doing very well, should I come? No. Ok, don’t come.

69
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:13,794
Just one word, I send the email, then... 
- I think we can make a break for one year

70
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:19,593
because they have been at this professor in Vienna and he was very astonished,

71
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:26,066
how can it be, they measured her and he didn’t expect from the hormones

72
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:30,042
that this measure would be so good and it is a wonder

73
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:41,346
and we kept it secret as you advised. He said that hormones are working so good etc.

74
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:50,209
– We didn’t want to make him so angry! He would be really angry!

75
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:55,698
Who has interfered with my work?

76
00:09:56,706 --> 00:10:01,426
– We know that this professor in Vienna is a real strict school medicine professor

77
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:07,298
and so you said to us that he would work against our work if he knew it.

78
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:11,377
So we kept it secret but he is very satisfied with the hormones

79
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:20,234
and we are satisfied because we feel that the remedies did their work very good

80
00:10:20,642 --> 00:10:22,954
and you can see it on the emotional level.

81
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:25,850
She is from emotional state completely different,

82
00:10:26,249 --> 00:10:34,834
The fits of rage are almost gone and she is warmer, she is not so jealous anymore

83
00:10:35,242 --> 00:10:38,745
and she doesn’t pressurize so much anymore.

84
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:46,922
The father says what should I tell Mr. Vithoulkas...

85
00:10:49,722 --> 00:11:02,458
- She is normal now and I am stupid! I should have told him to come here!

86
00:11:04,153 --> 00:11:12,210
But anyhow the interesting thing will be that the professor in about 6 months

87
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:16,073
will write a report to the medical journal,

88
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:23,585
saying how well the hormones acted upon the child

89
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:31,018
and how the child is growing normally in spite of what we know that they don’t grow.

90
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:44,660
– And she was growing very fast already and she is now almost 8.

91
00:11:46,162 --> 00:11:49,642
- My God!
– She is growing fast

92
00:11:50,018 --> 00:11:56,057
but the bones show it’s more childish and normal, and not like in puberty.

93
00:11:56,834 --> 00:12:07,330
That’s an interesting fact. She grows and it’s not so terrible.

94
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:17,266
The fear of the father that she may be small like a dwarf when she reaches puberty

95
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:21,209
and now she is growing normally.

96
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:26,594
– Is she still treated by hormones or the hormones have been cut?

97
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:32,115
– No, as he told me they reduced it, because it was running well

98
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,818
but still they are forced to give some of them

99
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:39,394
and they measure it so the father cannot lie.

100
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:55,186
– That is true. If he keeps on giving the hormones it may counteract the effect.

101
00:12:56,554 --> 00:13:01,914
The father has to take some action and avoid them totally.

102
00:13:02,577 --> 00:13:08,618
– If I tell him to come, he will come in 3 days. He can come anytime if you say so.

103
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:14,225
He told me if you say he should better come, he will come.

104
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:21,354
– Because after this seminar we continue with the complete,

105
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,730
in which case I will be teaching there for a few hours a day

106
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:34,521
and therefore he can come and give a report and so we discuss

107
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,658
and decide what is best for the child.

108
00:13:38,682 --> 00:13:42,290
– Because we have been exchanging mails and said if it’s necessary...

109
00:13:42,882 --> 00:13:46,002
- I did not pay attention because I have so many things.

110
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:53,441
You have seen me running back, looking and answering the emails.

111
00:13:54,346 --> 00:14:01,114
Because everything which comes to me is urgent. Otherwise they would not write.

112
00:14:02,978 --> 00:14:12,330
They would not care to write, how are you George? Are you having a good life?

113
00:14:14,683 --> 00:14:18,410
– They had the impression that at this moment it was maybe really the right decision,

114
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,954
I also had the impression that maybe we can wait. But maybe...

115
00:14:24,146 --> 00:14:29,217
- It is important that he comes because I am afraid that maybe he will interfere

116
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:42,514
and spoil the case. So, tell him if he likes to come within the next 2,5 weeks,

117
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,634
we will be here and we’ll take the case. We’ll show the case.

118
00:14:47,738 --> 00:14:51,010
– Can he come anytime?
– Yes.

119
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:56,394
– He can fly on the weekend because he is a medical doctor and is very busy.

120
00:14:56,786 --> 00:14:58,570
He can come on Friday to Monday...

121
00:15:00,162 --> 00:15:12,649
- Every day. He can come any time and I can go anytime. Thank you!
