1
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:24,022
We can start. Who is speaking? The father?–Yes.

2
00:00:25,302 --> 00:00:32,215
– Very good. Tell the story.
– From the beginning?

3
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:42,702
When she was neatly 1,5 year her breast began growing.

4
00:00:50,626 --> 00:01:01,382
– Pubic hair?
– Yes. Hairs were growing and she got having menses.

5
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:07,542
– At the age of 1,5 year?  Yes.

6
00:01:17,262 --> 00:01:23,662
– Do you know the mother had taken hormones during pregnancy?
– Not at all.

7
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:29,026
– To deliver?– No.

8
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:33,655
– Do you remember if they gave hormones to the mother in order to

9
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:41,826
deliver the baby in time?
– Not at all.

10
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:52,582
– He told me that they never gave hormones, no treatment

11
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:56,695
and the pregnancy was normal.

12
00:01:58,742 --> 00:02:05,902
– At what age did your wife have menses for the first time?
– I don’t know.

13
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,542
– How can you know? You never ask such questions!

14
00:02:19,778 --> 00:02:36,418
– But her mother told me that earlier when she was 10 she also had breast. She told me.

15
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:59,458
– When you met your wife what age was she?
– 35-36.

16
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:09,182
– And you were 36?
– I was 40-41.

17
00:03:15,582 --> 00:03:19,938
– And she has been given homeopathic remedies?

18
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:28,130
– I have given only acute remedies because for the chronic situation I didn’t give anything,

19
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:32,930
I didn’t want to confuse the case, it seems to me very unclear...

20
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,730
was not sure so I waited.

21
00:03:49,022 --> 00:04:00,542
– She took hormones?
– Yes. One time in a month I give her injection.

22
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:09,502
– You still give?
– Yes I am in Austria and forced by the law to give it.

23
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:19,500
– Why?
– The law says that she must get hormones because of this diagnosis.

24
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:25,900
He went to the doctor and they forced him to give the hormones from the law.

25
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:37,662
– And you can’t say you are giving them? The doctor is always behind checking?

26
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:42,022
–  Yes. They are very strict. If you don’t do it you have to pay money

27
00:04:42,263 --> 00:04:45,612
or go to prison because the law is if you have a child and it is minor...

28
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:53,022
- Do they control the hormones of the child?

29
00:04:54,822 --> 00:05:05,580
– He is with a professor in Vienna and he controls it.
– What are the estrogens?

30
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:21,452
– What is the remedy?
– It stops in pituitary gland (hypophysis) the growing of breast...

31
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:25,783
- And the menses went away after this hormone treatments.

32
00:05:27,852 --> 00:05:33,740
– The main problem was the before I gave her the injection

33
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:41,662
she grew 1cm in a month. Too fast.

34
00:05:46,135 --> 00:06:03,970
– What are the somatostatins?
 He does not have any hormonal examination?

35
00:06:04,982 --> 00:06:15,982
Testosterone is very high?
– Estrogens were high but now are lower.

36
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:31,102
– She 5 now.– Yes but growing stops after hormonal treatment.

37
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:42,370
– You see trembling at all?
– No.

38
00:06:47,982 --> 00:06:54,382
– And during menses she was very angry, aggressive?
– She got fits of rage.

39
00:06:57,462 --> 00:07:01,058
– Red face and perspired a lot.

40
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:10,530
– At sometimes I saw that she beats herself but not very often.

41
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:18,702
– She told me it was just once but more against the mother, she beats the mother.

42
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:23,330
When she got the menses at this age.

43
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,218
– She shouted go away, leave me alone?
– Yes.

44
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:38,690
– It was a kind of crazy feeling inside.
– Yes. Red head and argh!

45
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:46,862
– After the hormonal treatment it went away.

46
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:55,582
Everything was suppressed for me to see very clear what to give.

47
00:08:00,942 --> 00:08:09,902
– She didn’t want to be touched.
– She said leave alone, go away.

48
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:19,650
– Like this shouting?
– Leave me alone and argh!

49
00:08:20,662 --> 00:08:23,490
– With anger?– Yes.

50
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:40,898
– And here you write if she was in that rage and you took her in your hands,

51
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:48,822
you walked with her or you moved her like this?

52
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:55,742
– She stops. I took her mother taking her and then she stopped.

53
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:06,742
– Took her in her lap or just embraced her?
– Embraced her.

54
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:14,942
– In order to stop the rage the child had to be carried?

55
00:09:16,982 --> 00:09:22,102
– Yes but with power. Hold her and then she stops.

56
00:09:24,142 --> 00:09:26,210

60
00:10:08,702 --> 00:10:13,302

– Yes.

61

146
00:25:00,862 --> 00:25:03,662
She asks if there is someone...

147
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:22,370

If a man/boy came, if she was flirting?
– Sometimes, I think so.

158
00:27:28,302 --> 00:27:37,262
– Was she masturbating?
– Yes, I think if she sat she was making some movements.

159
00:27:37,538 --> 00:27:41,622
– Not anymore?
– Very rarely.

160
00:27:44,942 --> 00:27:51,102
But before I thought she was sitting here and she was doing...

161
00:27:55,182 --> 00:28:05,422
- In food, in meat, if there is some fat she will eat it?
– No.

162
00:28:08,502 --> 00:28:13,378
– To me he said she eats fat but maybe not so much.

163
00:28:19,502 --> 00:28:24,898
She doesn’t like fat, she puts it away.

164
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:32,822
– She likes fish?
– Fish, shrimps, too much.

165
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:36,418
– Ice cream?
– Very much.

166
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,610
– How much affected is she if you don’t feel well or her mother?

167
00:28:47,938 --> 00:28:55,862
– She has a good feeling. Sometimes I told my head is aching,

168
00:28:56,382 --> 00:29:16,098
she comes and tries to heal me.
– Not really scared. She’s not afraid, she wants to help.

169
00:29:20,702 --> 00:29:24,782
– For how long have they said that she must take these hormones?

170
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:36,822
– The professor in Vienna told that when she’s 10 years old we can stop.

171
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:43,982
– 5 years more.
– Do they control the hormones each time?

172
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:52,702
– Yes, each 4 months I have to go to Vienna with her,

173
00:29:59,102 --> 00:30:04,462
they take blood and control if there’s a problem.

174
00:30:08,062 --> 00:30:12,930
– We cannot stop this now and if this treatment helps

175
00:30:13,942 --> 00:30:23,662
they may reduce the amount of hormones, if hormones are in good level. Otherwise...

176
00:30:27,778 --> 00:30:32,622
- Now I have a problem, 2 months ago I was in Vienna for controlling

177
00:30:33,942 --> 00:30:40,855
and the professor made an x-ray of the hand, the growing of the bone

178
00:30:41,862 --> 00:30:51,342
and he told me that the growing of hand bones is at the age of 10 years

179
00:30:52,866 --> 00:31:13,346
and he told me that the height could be only 145 or 150 because the epiphysis will close.

180
00:31:14,382 --> 00:31:20,782
– What is her height now?
– 130.

181
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:26,935
– The growing has totally stopped?
– Not totally.

182
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:30,502
– Not yet but it could be too early.

183
00:31:30,775 --> 00:31:36,386
– I control it at a home and in 4 months she grows 1cm.

184
00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:43,062
– Before the injection she was growing very quickly.

185
00:31:48,182 --> 00:32:00,462
– She was growing very fast and now she got the injection and the level has gone down.

186
00:32:02,775 --> 00:32:06,862
– Has it hone down or almost stopped?
– Not stopped yet.

187
00:32:07,895 --> 00:32:16,066
– What was her height when she started and what is now?

188
00:32:16,582 --> 00:32:19,906
What is the difference between July 2005 and...

189
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:29,655
- She grows nearly 4 cm in one year.
– Can I write it down?

190
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:38,862
– Yes.
– When did you measure it? Was June and June?

191
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:54,982
From which time you compare? Last June, September?

192
00:32:56,262 --> 00:33:09,582
– I measured every month, 4 or 6 weeks.
– Her mother is good-looking?

193
00:33:15,735 --> 00:33:20,066
– Yes.
– Depends.

194
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:27,255
– Medium.
– Do you know if her mother was also infected with gonorrhea?

195
00:33:28,535 --> 00:33:42,342
– I think not. She told me nothing.
– But she was 36. She had lots of affairs.

196
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:47,222
– Not so much.
– How do you know?

197
00:33:47,982 --> 00:34:09,495
– She told me.
– In one year she grew 4 cm. Not 18 months?

198
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:24,066
– No it was one year. Last year July and then July had controlled and it was 4 cm.

199
00:34:32,262 --> 00:34:37,655
The professor had me to make a list and I control.

200
00:34:39,426 --> 00:34:44,302
– And he looks at it.
– Ok.

201
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,582
When the father gave some more information,

202
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:02,742
he says the professor in Vienna told that there are 15 other cases,

203
00:35:03,746 --> 00:35:09,382
quite rare syndrome and 80% of them are girls.

204
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:26,786
I asked him whether he know if his wife had gonorrhea he said she didn’t ever tell him.

205
00:35:31,906 --> 00:35:38,582
The father does not know if the mother had any venereal disease.

206
00:35:49,335 --> 00:35:55,462
The professor says we don’t know the reason why such syndrome appears.

207
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:06,982
Because it looks that the pituitary gland had gone mad producing hormones

208
00:36:08,262 --> 00:36:10,582
which are not needed.

209
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:22,102
– She is also producing excessive growth hormone,

210
00:36:22,342 --> 00:36:25,175
so the problem is actually even higher...

211
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:41,302
- The pituitary has gone crazy, I said producing a syndrome which is called acromegaly.

212
00:36:45,902 --> 00:37:09,462
Is producing hormones on these levels. Show me the control.

213
00:37:18,146 --> 00:37:22,502
Medorrhinum, Tarentula are the main remedies Lycopodium, Tuberculinum...

214
00:37:24,822 --> 00:37:33,262
Show me why. There 27 symptoms and 17...

215
00:37:37,862 --> 00:37:43,746
Anger from contradiction, anxiety for others, sympathetic, fear of the dark,

216
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:51,702
fear of ghosts, obstinate, restlessness in children, striking in children,

217
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:58,862
aversion to be touched, masturbation disposition, sea bathing ameliorates,

218
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:05,506
fish desire, ice cream desire, seaside amelioration and desire.

219
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:15,255
These are symptoms on which you can base your prescription on Medorrhinum.

220
00:38:16,782 --> 00:38:19,862
You may say why not Phosphorus.

221
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:33,942
Because there is lack of thirst according to what he says, if it is true,

222
00:38:35,462 --> 00:38:42,135
which you would expect that a child will have

223
00:38:42,902 --> 00:38:50,822
and on the other hand we have the information that the father had really gonorrhea.

224
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:13,942
Do you remember the theory which I have for the children being born healthy,

225
00:39:14,702 --> 00:39:33,655
the best conditions. The best conditions are when the 2 people are really in love

226
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:46,182
not sexually attracted. This was purely sexual attraction.

227
00:39:47,982 --> 00:39:57,975
The hormones played a major role, not the soul, not the feelings

228
00:40:02,822 --> 00:40:16,902
and I had explained why children are born best when the two people trust each other

229
00:40:18,455 --> 00:40:28,182
and feel melted away in one to the other and they enter one in another.

230
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:33,302
This is the best time for a child to be conceived

231
00:40:35,095 --> 00:40:41,222
when the ego of each of the two parts is totally eliminated

232
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:48,386
because of the erotic which overwhelms the two people.

233
00:40:49,422 --> 00:40:59,662
That is the time when the organisms being in an almost ecstasy

234
00:41:01,702 --> 00:41:06,062
they’re in the best possible condition.

235
00:41:09,902 --> 00:41:21,942
Because the moment that one is really very happy all the chemistry of the body changes

236
00:41:22,946 --> 00:41:30,902
and we have different chemistry within the sperm and the ova in that condition.

237
00:41:31,662 --> 00:41:39,342
The chemistry changes and you have the two people giving the best of themselves

238
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:51,382
to the child. And if two people are coming because of an only sexual attraction

239
00:41:53,175 --> 00:41:59,062
and a child is born, the child will be born with a lot of problems

240
00:42:02,135 --> 00:42:12,622
which will be mostly on hormonal level. Somebody is calling...

241
00:42:21,062 --> 00:42:51,415
Don’t say more! This type of cases show me that the theory is quite correct.

242
00:42:55,255 --> 00:43:15,462
Not only proved that if they examine the sperm of people in love they will find chemicals

243
00:43:15,982 --> 00:43:25,462
which are different from people that when the sperm comes out without real love.

244
00:43:27,502 --> 00:43:33,902
Not sexual attraction, it’s not enough.

245
00:43:36,706 --> 00:43:46,182
The idea is that in a love affair each of the two develops the desire to be together

246
00:43:49,506 --> 00:43:57,975
and especially the woman has to resist. That’s why the old people said in India,

247
00:43:58,982 --> 00:44:07,426
wait until you get married. So, there is an attraction, don’t go, they don’t come together.

248
00:44:07,942 --> 00:44:12,822
The attraction is more and more

249
00:44:13,062 --> 00:44:20,226
and when they come together it’s like the highest possible pleasure.

250
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:29,975
Because now you have what you desired all these years, flirting, playing etc.

251
00:44:30,466 --> 00:44:36,102
and that is the time when the child will be born with the best condition

252
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:46,342
and usually the children in western civilization are killed, forced abortion.

253
00:44:48,386 --> 00:44:54,022
Because they say at your age you are too young, you cannot have a child

254
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:57,622
because you are too young, because you are not married,

255
00:44:58,135 --> 00:45:02,222
because this or that, different reasons.

256
00:45:03,255 --> 00:45:12,462
Most of these children are killed because this erotic idea

257
00:45:13,986 --> 00:45:18,102
and possibility happens when people are in a young age.

258
00:45:20,386 --> 00:45:26,786
So the woman loses the child and then loses the boy she loves

259
00:45:27,062 --> 00:45:29,102
because he is not the proper boy,

260
00:45:29,862 --> 00:45:34,982
you to marry a boy who is in a good position in the society,

261
00:45:35,746 --> 00:45:41,382
marry someone in the bank, marry a doctor etc...

262
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:53,942
then it’s the mind interfering with emotions. And then is self-interest involving

263
00:45:54,702 --> 00:46:01,862
and then the lower parts of the humans will go into the child.

264
00:46:02,902 --> 00:46:14,146
What is calculating, only sexual attraction... you become the animal type...

265
00:46:21,062 --> 00:46:33,346
Sexual attraction. Sexual attraction can also give a child but of what type?

266
00:46:43,095 --> 00:46:50,502
Another thing is that such children of calculation they will become scientists,

267
00:46:52,546 --> 00:47:04,342
they will become economists, they will become scientists with twisted minds,

268
00:47:06,382 --> 00:47:17,902
they will try to find what is the best gas to kill people, they will discover the best gas,

269
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:24,055
they will discover a clever bomb and tell to the government

270
00:47:24,302 --> 00:47:29,422
we have found the clever bomb. Clever bomb is a bomb that kills only the people

271
00:47:29,942 --> 00:47:33,782
and does not bring down the buildings.

272
00:47:35,822 --> 00:47:46,822
People are killed the buildings can now be occupied by the enemy which comes inside

273
00:47:47,342 --> 00:47:53,986
and takes over. That is human mind how it works

274
00:47:54,502 --> 00:47:58,615
and why we have produced such minds in the west.

275
00:48:01,422 --> 00:48:07,575
Why don’t they produce such minds in Mexico, in Argentina, in India?

276
00:48:10,135 --> 00:48:14,222
Because most of the people are healthy.

277
00:48:14,742 --> 00:48:19,342
In the west people are born under these conditions.

278
00:48:19,586 --> 00:48:34,182
Calculating, self-interest and also egoism. When 2 people keeps himself...

279
00:48:35,462 --> 00:48:42,135
says you are there I am here and come together in a sexual act

280
00:48:43,906 --> 00:48:49,542
they don’t give the best out of themselves but they give the animal side.

281
00:48:50,306 --> 00:48:53,142
So you are doctors you have to know these things

282
00:48:53,382 --> 00:49:01,582
it doesn’t matter what happens in your life. You go back and meditate upon.

283
00:49:02,342 --> 00:49:06,182
The main thing is that this information is maybe correct

284
00:49:10,786 --> 00:49:14,626
and if this is correct we are making a big mistake

285
00:49:15,662 --> 00:49:23,586
in letting all the young women to have abortions.

286
00:49:30,262 --> 00:49:35,622
Of course a child can be born this way also, sexual attraction, you go one night

287
00:49:36,386 --> 00:49:41,506
and the next day you find yourself pregnant. This is not good either.

288
00:49:46,382 --> 00:49:56,102
So you have to have resistance and discipline. Oh, George is religious!

289
00:49:56,375 --> 00:50:01,742
No, I am not religious! I say it purely from a healthy point of view.

290
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:11,462
It is much better if you resist than having the experience.

291
00:50:11,982 --> 00:50:18,382
First, we have the experience with different people and then finally we get married.

292
00:50:19,662 --> 00:50:27,095
That is wrong! That is the type that children will be born with this condition.

293
00:50:27,586 --> 00:50:30,146
It’s not a matter of religion at all.

294
00:50:42,455 --> 00:50:47,062
Now the problem with this child is we are going to give Medorrhinum

295
00:50:48,855 --> 00:50:52,695
and now what is going to happen?

296
00:50:52,942 --> 00:51:02,146
Because if they don’t control the hormone levels what is going to happen...

297
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:06,262
we don’t know anymore what is happening

298
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:12,142
because the organism under Medorrhinum will try to balance itself,

299
00:51:13,175 --> 00:51:18,542
bring the pituitary gland work better.

300
00:51:20,066 --> 00:51:31,095
If we don’t have a control to see whether the amount of hormones is still necessary

301
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:37,986
we’ll damage the child through excess of hormones.

302
00:51:39,782 --> 00:51:42,342
So they have to control all the time

303
00:51:42,862 --> 00:51:47,222
and to able to tell to the professor listen Mr. professor

304
00:51:48,502 --> 00:51:51,822
the child is also taking homeopathic remedies

305
00:51:53,862 --> 00:51:57,702
and maybe that will change the levels of hormones.

306
00:51:59,502 --> 00:52:03,095
If the professor is open-minded he may accept it,

307
00:52:03,862 --> 00:52:15,895
if he is closed he will say nonsense and he will continue giving the same hormones.

308
00:52:21,506 --> 00:52:25,862
Medorrhinum, what kind? This is a problem.

309
00:52:26,626 --> 00:52:39,182
I want to give a dose Medorrhinum 200C once a month together with...

310
00:52:42,262 --> 00:52:46,615
not the same day, the day after...

311
00:52:47,106 --> 00:52:54,542
it’s better after the injection, next day you give Medorrhinum. Once a month.

312
00:52:56,855 --> 00:53:05,026
Within 6 months we will see whether the amount of hormones

313
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:11,702
which are given still necessary or maybe if he is careful...

314
00:53:13,495 --> 00:53:18,342
In case he is against Homeopathy the professor

315
00:53:19,862 --> 00:53:28,578
they must not tell him anything about Homeopathy otherwise he may do it on purpose...
