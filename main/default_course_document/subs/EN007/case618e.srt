1
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:32,620
This is the case of pubertas praecox of a young girl

2
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:41,822
who came here in September 2006 for the first time, 3 years ago

3
00:00:44,382 --> 00:00:52,823
and the first remedy that was given here is Med. 200C every month.

4
00:00:57,452 --> 00:01:00,262
She took for how many times?

5
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:08,972
– For 1 year. I think it was for 9 months from September till June,

6
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:15,372
when we came for a follow up

7
00:01:33,022 --> 00:01:43,782
and then you gave her Lachesis as a second remedy 200C and 1M.

8
00:01:47,102 --> 00:02:02,462
After another year in 2008 you gave her Phos. 30C, 31C, 32C for 3 months.

9
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:13,222
We are talking about the different layers.

10
00:02:19,863 --> 00:02:22,700
- What was the result?

11
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:30,622
After this remedy all the special emotional states calmed down.

12
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:44,183
After Med. the child was stable, after Lachesis this jealousy you discovered

13
00:02:45,463 --> 00:02:56,222
was much better and a year later after the Phos. she got a warmer.

14
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:03,383
Before she was inside herself, her fears went away.

15
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:08,503
She had fear of rain, fear of thunderstorms. All these got better.

16
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:14,662
Beside all these all the school medicine criterias [?] got better.

17
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,020
The school mediciners in Vienna are confident all was fine

18
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:23,372
and they don’t know we are making homeopathic treatment.

19
00:03:24,902 --> 00:03:28,742
They say it is almost a miracle, everything is developing fine.

20
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,902
The bone tests meet their criterias, if the bones are growing like a child

21
00:03:36,422 --> 00:03:44,620
or like a teenager and it was more like a child again. That gave us hope.

22
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:52,023
– Let’s say it for the people who do not know this problem

23
00:03:52,812 --> 00:04:00,983
that when there is such a syndrome then the child does not develop actually,

24
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:06,380
remains very short, the bones are not developed

25
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:17,900
because they don’t have the force of development of a child but of a grown-up person,

26
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:23,782
that grows very slow and the person remains quite short.

27
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:31,212
– Because the puberty ends at the age of 7 and then she could have the length of a dwarf.

28
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:39,142
And that was a big fear of the parents, the bad prognosis but now the school...

29
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:46,822
- Is it growing according to her age now?
– Yes.

30
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:52,183
– The height is according to her normal age.
– It’s almost like the normal age.

31
00:04:53,463 --> 00:05:04,492
The growth and the weight are in the normal, the curve of growth is ok.

32
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:17,783
The growth of the bones is also ok. And they measured the bones of the hand

33
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:24,702
and since 2 years it’s stable. Before it was unstable.

34
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:30,342
– So, she develop normally. We’re lucky.

35
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:45,943
The epiphyses normally after puberty are fixed and they are still open

36
00:05:46,462 --> 00:05:54,782
and the child is still growing still and that is also a sign for the school medicine

37
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:59,660
that the child grown normally. They are very confident.

38
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,063
– How does she feel?
– Fine, she says.

39
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:13,222
– She has good appetite?
– Yes.

40
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:23,212
–She eats quite a lot or not? She eats everything.
– Fruits she eats?

41
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:31,142
– She eats everything, nowadays she eats vegetables.
- Not enough fruits.

42
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:46,252
But if I cut them and I put them in a plate and look beautiful the fruits then she will eat it.

43
00:06:52,140 --> 00:07:03,383
– What does she ask for food mostly? Eggs, meat, fish, vegetables?

44
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:23,372
– Vegetables she doesn’t eat. She likes creamy soups, lasagna, ice cream very much.

45
00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:54,860
Spaghetti carbonara, soft things not hard. And she doesn’t like vegetables.

46
00:07:55,622 --> 00:08:01,502
– How much salt she needs?
– No salt. No pepper.

47
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:07,660
– Sweets?
– Normal

48
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:16,620
– In sleep she perspires at all?
– Sometimes.

49
00:08:19,422 --> 00:08:29,420
– Ask herself if she perspires in sleep.
– No.

50
00:08:31,462 --> 00:08:39,902
– In sleep she stays in one position or turns around? What position she sleeps in?

51
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:51,180
– She likes to sleep on the back and the arms not so... but here.

52
00:08:52,972 --> 00:09:08,823
But she changes her positions. And so often on the abdomen.

53
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:15,223
– She is afraid of the dark?
– Yes.

54
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:24,183
– She needs light in the room?
– She likes a little light is enough.

55
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:38,540
– Does she ever she any nightmares?
– Normally not

56
00:09:39,543 --> 00:09:55,422
but sometimes she talks during sleep and sometimes she wakes up with open eyes

57
00:09:56,183 --> 00:10:08,492
but she is not here. Not very often. The most of the times she sleeps quietly.

58
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:17,943
– Her nails are strong or brittle?
– She has good nails.

59
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:29,982
– She seems quite healthy.
– Thirst is normal or too much?

60
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:43,302
– She drinks not enough. I cannot control.
– But she is not asking for water?

61
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:51,223
– I must give her, I must say please drink, sometimes she drinks one glass,

62
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:59,180
a little glass all day long. She doesn’t go to the toilet.

63
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:09,932
If I ask when she says no she doesn’t drink...

64
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:29,623
- If she drinks cold drinks or tea is it the same?
– No she drinks water...

65
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:39,622
- But not tea or...
- No. She drinks cold and warm water.

66
00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:51,383
– Cold drinks I mean like Coca-cola.
– No. Lemon Fanta or orange Fanta.

67
00:11:52,422 --> 00:12:03,422
But always Fanta with water mixed. She doesn’t like too sweet drinks.

68
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:32,102
– Is she constipated?
– I think her stool is hard.

69
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:46,942
– Does she have pain?
– Short before she must go to the toilet she has little pain

70
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,582
and then she springs and then I know...

71
00:12:53,862 --> 00:13:04,620
- After stool she feels good?
– She feels much better. I can see it on her face.

72
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:18,942
And before she is...
- Ask her if she feels joyful after stool. Ask her.

73
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:27,902
– I will take a picture before and after. Hahah.

74
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:43,262
– Eggs?
– No. She doesn’t like.

75
00:13:45,822 --> 00:13:56,062
– Sometimes she eats soft boiled eggs but once in the month.

76
00:13:57,342 --> 00:14:07,582
If there are eggs in the salad she puts them aside or eats only the white not the yellow.

77
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:16,812
– Is she crying?
– Yes, every day.

78
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:27,820
– When she cries she has to go in her room or cries in front of you?
– In front of me.

79
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:40,620
– She feels better in warm or in cold weather?

80
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:50,583
Is she a hot person, likes open, fresh air or she is cold, likes to cover?


81
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:26,423
– She is warm, not freezing. Warmer than me. She is quite warm.

82
00:15:37,452 --> 00:15:42,572
– She can stay lying under the sun in the sea?

83
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:52,300
– Yes, she can but very often she goes in the water quite water,

84
00:15:52,542 --> 00:16:01,772
she can be in water for one and a half hour, it’s her element.

85
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:07,383
– Even today it was cloudy she was to go to the water.

86
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:19,942
Even then the lakes were cold in Austria I think she is a warm person

87
00:16:20,702 --> 00:16:26,583
longing for swimming and cold but not tremendously.

88
00:16:27,372 --> 00:16:35,052
– When there is some fat in her meat will she eat it or take it out?

89
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:48,620
– I cut it and I make this for her, I don’t know if she would do it herself.

90
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:59,372
I think she would make it. I think she would not like it.

91
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:07,820
– Butter? Bread and butter?
– Not really. I like more butter.

92
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,982
She takes the jam without butter. She eats bread without butter.

93
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:19,340
– She generally doesn’t like meat so much but fish.

94
00:17:21,382 --> 00:17:26,502
– She like more fish?
– Yes.

95
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:47,223
– She likes wiener schnitzel. All children in Austria like this. It’s baked veal.

96
00:17:48,012 --> 00:17:59,532
– She likes beer???
– She has tried it. But she doesn’t like it. It is too bitter.

97
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,980
– She used to snore very much. How is it now?

98
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:31,262
– Sometimes her tongue goes a little back and she snores. Sometimes not always.

99
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:35,863
– She sees dreams, she remembers her dreams?

100
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:46,892
– No. She says that she had a dream but she cannot remember it.

101
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:54,302
She knows that she dreams but she cannot remember.

102
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:11,703
– In the morning she is always tired. And I am too.
– She needs to sleep more?

103
00:19:14,263 --> 00:19:25,783
– No, if she goes earlier to bed she is tired too. Morning is not her time.

104
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:36,542
– And concerning her emotions I have different impression from the mother

105
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:43,980
than from the father. The father says she is very stable and without fits of rage anymore.

106
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:52,172
But with her she has more emotion, more fights.
– She fights with her mother?

107
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:56,780
– More. I think it is very different what she tells me than what the father tells me.

108
00:19:57,783 --> 00:20:04,183
– She behaves different to her mother than her father.
– Her father is more friendly.

109
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:19,820
– She tries to behave in the way her father likes. With her she has fights. It’s typical.

110
00:20:21,342 --> 00:20:25,702
The mother is responsible, she lives with the mother and they have more fights.

111
00:20:26,462 --> 00:20:30,060
– They are separated?
– Yes. The father doesn’t live.

112
00:20:30,302 --> 00:20:32,862
– When did they get separated?
– They’ve never been together.

113
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:37,982
The father comes every day but they don’t live together.

114
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:44,902
– She is sighing sometimes?
– Yes.

115
00:20:46,700 --> 00:21:07,692
– She says “I have to do so much!”.
– She sighs because she has to do so much.

116
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:17,143
– I think she says this because I say this.
– Is she sad sometimes?

117
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:26,892
– Yes, sometimes.
– What is the best time for her?

118
00:21:29,702 --> 00:21:40,702
– The afternoon is a good time until 5. When I come it is not such a good time,

119
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:59,383
maybe from 5-7 p.m. and later she will be better again. She cries in this period.

120
00:22:03,223 --> 00:22:12,183
– I think in this time she will get a little but tired, she feels not so good

121
00:22:12,702 --> 00:22:16,300
and then she will be very sensitive in this time

122
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:23,980
and later she feels better again after 7 and then.

123
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:31,383
– She can stay until 12 a.m.?
– Yes.

124
00:22:41,132 --> 00:23:02,892
– That’s enough. We know what to give.

125
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:07,500
– He has some special questions and then he knows!

126
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:18,252
Ok, you saw the first case and the analysis.

127
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:30,220
As you hear it was followed by one dose of Lachesis next year

128
00:23:32,012 --> 00:23:40,183
and the third year by a dose of Phos. according to the symptoms that she developed.

129
00:23:43,262 --> 00:23:55,052
Which again points to the fact that complicated cases are not going to be well with one remedy.

130
00:23:56,582 --> 00:24:05,783
When we hear that a case was cured with one remedy

131
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:13,740
most of the times it doesn’t mean the case was cured

132
00:24:15,782 --> 00:24:20,652
unless we have patients on the first,

133
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:29,250
second or third level this can happen. But these are few cases,

134
00:24:29,742 --> 00:24:36,142
most cases today are complicated and they need a series of remedies

135
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:45,622
and they needs a remedy at a certain point . The problem is for instance in this case,

136
00:24:46,658 --> 00:24:55,862
if you havew given Phos. instead of Med. as first remedy nothing would have happened.

137
00:24:56,382 --> 00:25:05,502
If you had given Lach. Nothing. Now the problem is that you give the wrong,

138
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:13,943
the underlying remedy because you have symptoms of the remedy which is underneath,

139
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:23,942
so you prescribe it and finally you give the correct remedy

140
00:25:24,702 --> 00:25:31,863
and then the picture of the remedy you have prescribed in the beginning comes up again

141
00:25:32,652 --> 00:25:35,980
and you say I have given this remedy and had no effect

142
00:25:36,742 --> 00:25:39,820
and you go and give another remedy.

143
00:25:40,332 --> 00:25:44,172
You see how you can be confused to really take a case

144
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:52,343
and progress it it’s a matter of absolutely precise prescription,

145
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,262
that’s why I don’t believe all these nonsense with new remedies.

146
00:26:03,102 --> 00:26:07,212
They do not know the usual remedies.

147
00:26:08,492 --> 00:26:14,892
I found people who cannot recognize a Calc. or Sulph. and they give a new remedy.

148
00:26:15,902 --> 00:26:26,142
I have been practicing with great success without the need of any new remedy.

149
00:26:26,662 --> 00:26:31,782
We have already here 780 remedies. Why do you need more?

150
00:26:32,542 --> 00:26:37,662
You say ‘modern medicine’. Absolute nonsense!

151
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:46,103
What happen is that people think now they found a new remedy and so what?

152
00:26:47,142 --> 00:26:57,132
You may need once in your life maybe a new remedy if it was really proved properly.

153
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,502
But even the provings of the new remedies are fantasies.

154
00:27:05,062 --> 00:27:12,983
So Homeopathy is going according to the symptoms you can see.

155
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:31,422
I will tell you something. They wrote to me from America today, I received an email,

156
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:42,423
that I practice and I have great success with the new remedies

157
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:57,292
and why WHO are acting again Homeopathy? They say Homeopathy is no good.

158
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:05,982
They say it because there is no effect. If you claim to be a homeopath

159
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:15,703
and you prescribe correctly once in 100 nobody is going to take notice of you.

160
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:28,012
Here in Greece where my students have been practicing properly

161
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:37,222
we have one hospital ‘Gennimatas’ that has a department in Neurology department

162
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:39,782
with Homeopathy at the moment.

163
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:44,902
One of the biggest gynecological hospitals are carrying

164
00:28:45,662 --> 00:28:49,772
a research for sterility ‘Helena’ hospital.

165
00:28:51,543 --> 00:28:56,663
In the university of Aegean we have an master’s degree in Homeopathy.

166
00:28:58,462 --> 00:29:01,022
With four M.Ds and dentists.

167
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:09,222
We are preparing a special school of Homeopathy in the island of Kos.

168
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:16,902
How these things have happened? Only because of the effect.

169
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:27,142
Because politicians want to be treated, judges, lawyers, scientists come and see effect,

170
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:35,852
also professors of medicine come and see that here it is a serious condition.

171
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:44,542
How they can resist? Why in Greece we have such an explosion of Homeopathy

172
00:29:45,062 --> 00:29:49,420
and in London they close down half of their practices?

173
00:29:50,182 --> 00:29:55,543
Because there is not effect with those nonsense they are circulated.

174
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:14,502
I want you to tell me what do you understand

175
00:30:14,743 --> 00:30:27,543
that we should do at this point in time with this girl? Shall we wait?

176
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:31,902
Shall we give a repetition of the last remedy which was Phos.?

177
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:48,542
Or are there some indications for another remedy? Difficult problems.

178
00:30:52,902 --> 00:30:58,022
I don’t see anybody jump into the answer...

179
00:31:08,503 --> 00:31:14,412
- I think at this moment the girl is in a good state of health

180
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:26,942
and there is not another picture of a new remedy and I think it is better to wait.

181
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:39,223
– The same. I think we have to wait because the bone condition is very good

182
00:31:40,503 --> 00:31:54,583
and the mental condition is also good.
– I think there are some keynotes for Ignatia.

183
00:31:55,372 --> 00:32:07,902
The fact that she is sighing and there are some days that she is weeping

184
00:32:09,452 --> 00:32:20,183
and the desire for fruits is less. But it’s not a clear picture.

185
00:32:41,452 --> 00:32:45,022
– I think that Phos. picture is changing a little bit.

186
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:49,132
The fact that she is not well between 5-7 p.m.

187
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:54,252
and after 8 a.m. she can stay up until 12 a.m.

188
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,860
and also her worst time of the day is morning.

189
00:33:00,652 --> 00:33:10,892
So these are some keynotes of Lyc. The mother said she cannot wake up in the morning.

190
00:33:12,172 --> 00:33:18,302
And you asked her does she want to sleep more that was your question

191
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:29,303
so you were trying whether there is an indication for Lyc. or Nit-ac. or a Magnesia.

192
00:33:31,102 --> 00:33:33,932
This is what I observed.

193
00:33:48,012 --> 00:33:57,982
– According to me there is no clear picture at this moment but there are 2 possibilities.

194
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:05,143
One is Ignatia as she said and the other Lycopodium.

195
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:15,142
Because she says in the morning she cannot wake up

196
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:21,542
so she is unrefreshed no matter how long she may have slept.

197
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:26,903
That’s one keynote for Lyc. The other keynote is

198
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:35,102
that she says that between 5-8 p.m. she is in a bad mood and not feeling well

199
00:34:36,382 --> 00:34:45,342
but after 8 she can go on and she is more alive and she is much more aware,

200
00:34:46,892 --> 00:34:56,620
clear and happy. This 3 symptoms are symptoms of Lyc.

201
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:11,212
But at the same time it is very interesting the idea of Ign.

202
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:22,982
Because of the fruits and the sighing I don’t remember one more symptom

203
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:28,343
that pointed to Ign. But anyhow.

204
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:36,023
You remember I was asking about the situation with the parents.

205
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:52,422
That means that the child has definitely perceived a kind of grief

206
00:35:53,452 --> 00:36:03,180
because of the separation. She is tormented, torn between father and mother.

207
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:07,020
She likes the mother but she fights with her

208
00:36:07,782 --> 00:36:11,863
but she likes more the father with whom she doesn’t fight etc.

209
00:36:14,182 --> 00:36:23,660
You see an internal struggle in the child. Therefore the idea of Ign. is definitely there

210
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:39,020
and most probably will develop. It means that as she grows up she will be more

211
00:36:39,262 --> 00:36:44,140
and more aware of the real problems within the family,

212
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:53,342
the moment she will be really aware then the picture of Ign. will pop up quite strongly.

213
00:36:55,660 --> 00:37:02,572
But at this moment we are justified to give a dose Lyc. 200C

214
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:19,980
and wait for the time either Ign. or Nat-m will come up to make the grief a little bit better.

215
00:37:27,902 --> 00:37:34,572
– The mother asked me to add that she has tremendous fears

216
00:37:36,343 --> 00:37:38,142
and we didn’t talk about it yesterday

217
00:37:38,662 --> 00:37:47,622
but the mother asked me to tell you she has fears to call somebody even a friend,

218
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:51,462
she always asks the mother to do this.

219
00:37:52,742 --> 00:38:00,663
– This is very interesting concerning Lyc. Because it is a coward person,

220
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,783
who has no courage so needs to call somebody

221
00:38:06,572 --> 00:38:10,662
and she has fear if I call somebody what he will say.

222
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,262
– The mother says it is really a big problem because she is in an age

223
00:38:15,782 --> 00:38:19,622
where other children do this for example other children go for ice

224
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,212
and she always says mom do this for me.

225
00:38:24,742 --> 00:38:34,062
– That means that is a confirmation that Lyc. is going to help quite a lot. 200C Lyc.

226
00:38:35,342 --> 00:38:41,986
and we’ll see next year.
– I think this is important

227
00:38:42,502 --> 00:38:47,382
because there is a kind of shyness because on one hand she is sportive,

228
00:38:47,622 --> 00:38:53,506
she has courage for swimming but on the other hand she doesn’t talk to people,

229
00:38:54,786 --> 00:38:59,906
she didn’t talk with you. Kind of shyness, not enough courage.
