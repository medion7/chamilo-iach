1
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:35,090
I have promised that I will see Dr Bennis from Germany, he is a very good homeopath,

2
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:43,090
excellent homeopath and he has sent a case which he was treating,

3
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,430
it is in your hands now.

4
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:55,610
A case of a young male 31 years old, married with two daughters,

5
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,720
who first went for consultation..

6
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:20,370
I had a look and the first look I have seems that the case is incurable,

7
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:27,820
as far as Homeopathy is concerned. We can not do almost anything with this case.

8
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,620
But since I did not have a good look, we are going to look together

9
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,860
and see if we can make a better prescription than the prescription

10
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:49,150
that was given which was Alumina, Phosphorus and then Alumina phosphorica.

11
00:01:53,650 --> 00:02:08,260
It is a case of diabetes, treated with fixed amount of insulin since 1994

12
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:18,620
and then he had a hemorrhage into the corpus vitreum of both eyes, first left,

13
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,520
then right since September 1996.

14
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,540
One and a half year before detachment of retina.

15
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:43,160
So he had detachment of retina and then he had hemorrhage in the eyes

16
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,140
which developed in the 9th of 1996.

17
00:02:48,240 --> 00:03:01,630
Visual aptitude reduced a lot since September 96. Now left nearly blind and 16 to 24...

18
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:17,470
I don't understand what it is.
-Per cent.

19
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:33,900
-Are you sure? 16 to 24,6 %?
-Yes it is per cent.

20
00:03:50,150 --> 00:04:01,150
-The man is almost blind.
-Not at all.

21
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:08,980
-16 % you can see with one eye?
-It's working.

22
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:18,150
From the clinical examination one would have to say this man is practically blind,

23
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:26,500
the objective examination says this, but subjectively the man says, I can see quite well.

24
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,980
-It's still working, so yes he can see and function.

25
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,900
-A boy who has lost both his eyes and works for the Ministry of Transportation

26
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
doesn't mean anything.

27
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,210
-But he can see still, he can see both his daughters for instance and he can work

28
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,200
and function with it. He is going to work every day.

29
00:04:52,300 --> 00:05:01,450
-What do you mean "can see"? He can see shapes or just barely can differentiate

30
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:06,390
whether this is one daughter or the other?

31
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:16,890
That's what you mean. All right. We said almost blind, we didn't say blind.

32
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:30,040
All answers come out only very difficult, very tenacious, slow moving,

33
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,060
even the easiest question is answered with great difficulty.

34
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:41,290
So here we have a mental symptom, which we can find in the Repertory.

35
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:59,790
Now you go to the Repertory, you look hemorrhages in the eyes, which is the pathology.

36
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:06,370
Then diabetes. Diabetes and hemorrhages are close to a remedy,

37
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:18,990
which is called Phosphoric acid. We said yesterday on Phosphoric acid, we have diabetes.

38
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:51,210
We can see the repertorization here. Answers slowly, so by these two  things that we see,

39
00:06:51,310 --> 00:07:14,970
diabetes and slow answering, here we see Phosphoric acid is the remedy

40
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,960
that we have to be thinking.

41
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:33,630
As we said Phosphoric acid produces diabetes and produces also this slowness, mental slowness,

42
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:41,960
difficult thinking. What is the symptom here?

43
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:06,620
Always answers come out very difficulty, very tenacious, even easy questions are answered

44
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,900
with great difficulty, the more the pressure, the more difficult it gets for him to answer.

45
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,360
He says, I know the answer, some keywords but I can't remember the sentences,

46
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:28,110
so forgets the words as in Phosphoric acid.

47
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:42,140
Go to the Repertory and find 'forgets words'. Phosphoric acid capital.

48
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,450
So you are learning Phosphoric acid.

49
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:02,370
You remember when I described Phosphoric acid, I said he tries to remember the word,

50
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:09,440
he wants to say the word "glasses" and he looks at the glasses and he can't remember.

51
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:17,790
He says, 'you wear glasses' finally but it takes a long time to think

52
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:27,370
and to bring back the words. So actually here it says some keywords that can not remember.

53
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,620
No feeling gets to the surface in an obvious way.

54
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,790
Anger, wants to hit somebody and what comes out in the end is a quiet talk.

55
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:50,800
How you will look for that symptom? No feeling comes to the surface.

56
00:09:50,900 --> 00:10:06,130
That means feelings do not surface, do not come out and the man looks quiet.

57
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:24,360
Find the rubric quiet. He is very quiet on the outside.

58
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:39,700
Look at this rubric. Did you see the rubric? What you see again?

59
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:50,360
You see that Phosphoric acid is again very strong.

60
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:57,600
If I had given you this case for examination...

61
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:04,030
You know what happens if you don't answer correctly.

62
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:13,680
I don't know how he missed this because the first remedy...

63
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:18,940
For everything he needs time and preparation, then he can work a lot and well.

64
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,770
If he is surprised or should react spontaneously, he breaks off and stops.

65
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,860
He does not find the words, again.

66
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,760
Nothing comes out of him. That's why he plans everything.

67
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:45,870
He says, I never get up and just think - let's see what happens.

68
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:09,550
It says that he has to plan carefully what he does, otherwise he can not perform.

69
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:17,110
That means his mind is very slow, his feelings are not existent.

70
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:24,510
There is a kind of slowness of the mind, slowness of the feelings.

71
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:35,360
He can not remember words, he says, I can't, I try to say a word and I can not find the word.

72
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,260
-The patient together with Dr Bennis, this is what Dr Bennis has sent me.

73
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,260
It is not true that he is got no feelings, he's got very, very strong feelings

74
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,270
but he can't get them out. He is so angry, he could kill somebody,

75
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,860
it's very strong feelings that he has.

76
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,190
But when he tries to bring those feelings out, on the way

77
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:18,040
while he is trying to bring them out, then he ends up with this quiet talk.

78
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:28,930
-Exactly and that is why we say to be quiet is not pathology.

79
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:41,650
To be calm and quiet is nice and it is not pathology. Pathology is when you are not quiet

80
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:49,630
and you are forced by the disease to be quiet. Then it is pathology.

81
00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:05,030
Correct? Understood? This is what he says. He can not express any feelings.

82
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:12,780
It is the same thing. It doesn't matter, deep down we know.

83
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,610
Pronounced lack of self-confidence. Look lack of self-confidence.

84
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:41,960
Phosphoric acid is not appearing, fears, dependence, fear of being depending,

85
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:51,760
that something happens to his children or wife, darkness and spiders.

86
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,280
Are these fears strong or mild?

87
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:03,100
-The depending is very strong; the other fear that is very pronounced is that the fear

88
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,440
that something will happen to his wife or children.

89
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,510
For instance if he sees his children running out into the garden, he will immediately connect

90
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:21,350
that with an accident, that some accident will happen to them. He gets the vision of that.

91
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:33,710
-Put anxiety about others and lack of self-confidence, twice both.

92
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:41,690
Fear of dependence we don't have it as a symptom but here is not a symptom, it is a fact.

93
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,520
He has a fear that he will depend on someone who will take him to lead him

94
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,870
because he can not see.

95
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:57,020
-But he had that before also, before getting so sick and soft of depending,

96
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,540
he has already had that symptom.

97
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:09,040
-There is no symptom in the Materia Medica but I say in such serious cases,

98
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:18,060
this is a juvenile diabetes, they know the future.

99
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:30,710
The future is very bleak, very bad and put fear of darkness underlined once.

100
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,810
She says it is not so strong.

101
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:46,560
Anxiety about others, twice. He could not pee in front of a lot of people.

102
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:57,790
Whatever he does has to be perfect. Building a toy for the children has to look as if bought.

103
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:05,390
Car clean, obstinate, has a difficulty to not follow his plan.

104
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:30,370
Desires bread with cheese and sausage without butter, prefers cold food.

105
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:43,710
Prefers cold food, put it twice. Bread with cheese we don't have it as a symptom.

106
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:49,050
We have bread and we have cheese but not bread with cheese.

107
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:55,310
Headache above left eye after straining the eyes.

108
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,980
Put headache above left eye.

109
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:19,900
Worse in the morning, has to sit on the bed for quite a while before he starts seeing something.

110
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:29,890
Worse after sleep, also you put it underlined twice.

111
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:56,310
Head pain forehead, that's more correct.

112
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:11,710
I'm just doing this to show you that most probably even if you put all symptoms in the case,

113
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:17,810
once you have put the strong symptoms with underlining them properly,

114
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:34,910
the repertorization will insist on Phosphoric acid and will say the remedy is Phosphoric acid.

115
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:48,730
12 symptoms they are put already. Show me the columns.

116
00:19:50,420 --> 00:20:01,670
Nux vomica, Phosphoric acid, show me Phosp. acid.

117
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:22,560
She did not underline properly, answers slowly is very strong, it has to be 3 times,

118
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:37,780
just put it 3 times. Forget words it's so strong, at least 3 times.

119
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:51,810
Quiet disposition also this so strong, 3 times, show me now the analysis.

120
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:10,370
Not only it says Phosphoric acid but there is no other way that you can analyze this case,

121
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,830
you can not give another remedy. The remedy is Phos. acid,

122
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:18,990
it doesn't matter that it does not cover all the symptoms,

123
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:25,340
it covers the main symptoms and the main symptoms are strong and this is the remedy.

124
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:38,520
So here in this case, you have a good example of Phos. acid with a difference,

125
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:50,230
that the pathology underlying such a case is so strong that it is doubtful

126
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,480
how much you can help such a case.

127
00:21:53,580 --> 00:22:04,170
And because the pathology is sensitive here, you have to be careful of the potency.

128
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:11,770
In this case you really have to be careful of the potency

129
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:22,250
and what could be the best potency for him? What potency you would suggest for him?

130
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:45,400
Very low like 6X or 6C, medium like 30? How much insulin he needs?

131
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:55,750
-40.
-It's quite a lot.

132
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,250
-What about LN potencies?

133
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:24,590
-I have not been convinced that LN potencies can handle a situation of that type.

134
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,910
I don't know, I haven't got the experience, I have given it a few times only.

135
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:43,070
I know the potencies how they work in the centesimal, 1 over 100,

136
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:58,960
so I would suggest in this case 6C, 1/100 6.

137
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,900
-Blood sugar all his life long was really difficult to handle

138
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:15,250
and after receiving Alumina for the first time in his life he could manage his blood sugar.

139
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:31,070
-What does that mean? You said blood sugar was unstable, going up and down,

140
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:37,990
is that correct?
-Yes.

141
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:42,250
-And after Alumina it steadied to a level,

142
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,840
is that correct?
-Yes.

143
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:53,490
-The level to which it stayed what it is? Now it's 40 units, before what it was?

144
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:59,180
It was 50, 60 and then 20?

145
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:07,580
-The blood sugar levels in the blood would differ between 350 and 60.

146
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,830
So 350 is far too much and 60 is too little.

147
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:19,570
So before, even though they were giving insulin, it was changeable, very changeable.

148
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:26,320
-Wait a moment. With the same amount of insulin, the readings on the blood

149
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,820
would be different, is that what he is saying?

150
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:35,080
-I'm trying to say this. Until 1994 he had a fixed amount of insulin

151
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,650
that he was getting to try to control his blood sugar but it was never possible.

152
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:45,170
Then after 1994 he got flexible amounts ...

153
00:25:53,010 --> 00:26:00,420
-No, first consultation in 1996, is this incorrect?

154
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,910
-No, three lines underneath, just read.

155
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:15,070
-Since 1994 flexible treatment with frequent controls of blood sugar.

156
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:21,820
That means from time to time he would go up to 60 units

157
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:30,680
and then come down to 20 units of insulin.

158
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:39,070
Flexible treatment means changing the amount of insulin needed at the moment,

159
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,250
according to the blood reading.

160
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:53,440
In any case chronologically this does not correspond with the homeopathic treatment.

161
00:26:53,540 --> 00:27:01,190
Chronologically it says until 1994... and then flexible treatment with frequent...

162
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:07,990
-George, if you look in the follow ups you will see that before he had either rigid

163
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:13,740
or flexible amounts of insulin but the blood sugar was never able to be controlled.

164
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,760
Then after getting Alumina for the first time in his life

165
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,990
the blood sugar was never more than 200.

166
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:33,910
It was always between 150 and 250 but it never really shot up anymore.

167
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:38,510
So her question is, what does that mean concerning Alumina?

168
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,660
-Before I can answer what I want to know is when the treatment was flexible,

169
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:55,420
it was coming from 20 units of insulin to 100 units of insulin or what?

170
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,930
This is what I'm asking in order to be able to make an assessment.

171
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:06,910
-What happened was that the amount of insulin actually he could not reduce at all,

172
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:13,320
whether he did it rigidly, with a fixed amount of insulin or whether he did it

173
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,320
in the way of flexible amounts of insulin.

174
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,990
The only advantage when he put flexible amount of insulin was that he

175
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:27,240
could control his blood sugar a little bit better, so that the peaks of blood sugar

176
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:36,100
would not be so high anymore. So the amount did not differ.

177
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:43,070
-How is that possible that the amount does not differ if the treatment is flexible?

178
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:47,830
How is that possible? It's not possible for me to comprehend that.

179
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:53,320
Flexible treatment means either you take every second day,

180
00:28:53,420 --> 00:29:03,750
either you take different amounts of insulin every day, this is flexible treatment.

181
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:11,090
-So basically he gets three different types of insulin.

182
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:17,840
One is the old insulin, the long acting insulin, this is the basic treatment

183
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,840
and he gets it all the time.

184
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:27,340
Then to cut the peaks of insulin, he takes some sort acting insulin

185
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,930
and this differs from day to day.

186
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:48,340
-Anyhow, she was asking whether this steadying it means a better situation.

187
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:57,930
I'm not sure, it may mean a worse situation. In order to decide whether it is better

188
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:04,680
or worse it depends on the amount of insulin needed now than before.

189
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:11,930
If now he needs more amounts of insulin, that whole situation got worse

190
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:17,430
and became steady yes, but before the organism was trying.

191
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:27,510
Sometimes bringing down, burning the sugar. And the sugar was going down.

192
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:35,500
Now it does not burn the sugar, so you can not say it is better unless you know

193
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,500
that before he needed 100 units and after the homeopathic treatment, he needs 40 units.

194
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:50,770
Then we cay say yes it is better, it had an effect on the diabetes.

195
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:54,760
I don't know if it had an effect on his mental-emotional.

196
00:30:54,860 --> 00:31:06,010
In any case, seeing the case, since you want an advice, I would say without question

197
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:14,340
I would start this case with Phosphoric acid, I would go to low potency of Phosphoric acid

198
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:21,380
and give repeatedly three times the day and then this Phosphoric acid,

199
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:27,130
I would raise it every week one potency.

200
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:39,120
First week 6C, second week 7C, third week 8C and you go like this

201
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:50,090
and by the end of three months maybe you can find out

202
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,940
whether the treatment is giving some positive effect.

203
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:08,430
So three times daily, 6C, 7C, 8C, 9C, 10C...

204
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:23,920
But my question is why I say this? Most probably it is an incurable case.

205
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,930
Because it is a juvenile diabetes and when we have a juvenile diabetes,

206
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:34,520
the treatment is very difficult to have an effect.

207
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:46,020
The pathology is very deep, the pancreas, the islets of Langerhans are totally destroyed,

208
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:54,510
they do not produce any insulin, so how can we improve this situation?

209
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,110
I'm not sure we can do it.

210
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:09,610
Interesting enough, you remember in Phosphoric acid, just put back Phosphoric acid...

211
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:29,360
Diabetes in its progress state gives symptoms of Phosphoric acid.

212
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:44,010
It is a typical pathology of diabetes because it affects the circulation,

213
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:54,860
the vascular system. You see there? Diabetes.

214
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:08,760
We have the elements, the apathetic, the indifference and the weakness

215
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:14,940
and the emotional progressing to the physical and mental planes.

216
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:23,680
The weakness on the emotional level which affects the mental level

217
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,850
and which affects also the physical level. How it affects?

218
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:33,930
It affects in this way exactly, as he describes in this case.

219
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:44,680
So it was a good case for learning live something about Phosphoric acid.

220
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:51,090
You remember I described to you how difficult it is to find words.

221
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:58,600
He says, I can't find words. He says it so clearly as if he is talking on Materia Medica,

222
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,700
Phosphoric acid Materia Medica is this what he is talking.

223
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:14,850
-How do you explain the anger which can not come out? He is very angry.

224
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:21,100
-Be in that state and you will see how..

225
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,860
-I have the same question for apathetic. That means for me

226
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,760
that there is nothing in and nothing comes out, here there is a lot of emotions inside

227
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,510
but do not come out. It's a big problem.

228
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:53,200
-Yes, here in cases of grief we see really this total flatness of emotions.

229
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,430
Grief takes away the emotions.

230
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:04,200
We have a pathology here, we don't have grief, we have a pathology which brings about,

231
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:14,530
but the total result is the same. He can not express any emotion. His mind is very slow.

232
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:21,530
He cannot find the word, he cannot answer. You go to the repertorization

233
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:28,460
and you see all these symptoms very strongly on Phosphoric acid.

234
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,040
But still now Phosphoric acid will not cure this case.

235
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:41,300
-How can I recognize which potency I have to take?

236
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:52,690
-Here we go low because of the possibility of hemorrhage.

237
00:36:52,790 --> 00:37:07,450
A little bit stimulation on the vascular system, on circulation, may produce some hemorrhage.

238
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:14,950
So we have to stimulate as little as possible and slowly.

239
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:19,800
It's like pushing somebody very nicely.

240
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:40,700
Maybe it can be pushed, it's not sure at all because once an organ is finished,

241
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:50,030
then you can not replace it. Never mind how much you push.

242
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:56,630
Something which is dead will never start working, it will stay there dead.

243
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:03,950
If there is any possibility of regeneration of the pancreas, maybe there is,

244
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,210
I don't know, God knows only.

245
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:12,960
I'm not in a position to know, but experience shows,

246
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:20,790
because I have tried several cases of juvenile diabetes, little effect.

247
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:29,300
-George, what are the other major remedies that you might be thinking of for diabetes?

248
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:37,190
-Best remedy for diabetes is Natrum Sulphuricum and remedies

249
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:50,790
which have strong desire for sweet things and at the same time they have strong thirst.

250
00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:11,700
They can be like Sulphur, Argentum nitricum, Lycopodium. These are remedies for diabetes.

251
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,780
-Uranium nitricum.

252
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:31,390
-Uranium nitricum yes, when the sugar comes mostly out in the urine.

253
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,440
When you have urine loaded with sugar there is a possibility.

254
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:42,530
I have tried the Uranium nitricum several times, I have not seen the effect.

255
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:49,280
Maybe we don't have enough information to prescribe more accurately the remedy.

256
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,530
It is true, it is written like this.

257
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:56,780
-What about (?) It's often suggested.

258
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,530
-I don't know.

259
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,380
-I don't also know.

260
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:15,620
-But I have seen simple cases of diabetes, when diabetes starts at the age of 40, 45, 50

261
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:24,380
and they come early, the best remedy is Natrum sulphuricum in the beginning,

262
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:33,460
Sulphur is a second remedy, Argen. nitricum is another remedy, Lycopodium is another remedy

263
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:43,460
and Phosphoric acid once the effects of diabetes have gone into the vascular system

264
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:50,650
and they produce a similar state like this. This is too strong.

265
00:40:51,640 --> 00:41:00,050
If you can imagine the effort of this man to survive, the will power

266
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:12,380
that he exercises every day. His mind is totally empty, can not receive and react.

267
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,370
You can understand.

268
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:35,300
He says, I know the answers... for everything he needs time and preparation.

269
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,050
Then he can work a lot and well. If he is surprised or should be react, forget it.

270
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:49,790
He breaks off and stops short. He does not find the words. Nothing comes out of him.

271
00:41:53,390 --> 00:42:05,800
Never mind these remarks, I described to you how the person tries to say a word,

272
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:15,790
even he sees the object and he can not bring the word to his mind.

273
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:23,790
I look at the telephone and the word is totally gone on my mind.

274
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:43,390
And they try..... telephone. It takes so long. They look at it..... Glasses.

275
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,550
You see how slow it is?

276
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:54,560
It is described here, it's very beautiful, Phosphoric acid in Materia Medica.

277
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,800
It can not be better, I could not have described it better.

278
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:11,310
Here you write first hand and then what he says, quiet, I come out and I'm quiet!

279
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:17,140
Many times I have said what is quiet? It's not good to have quiet?

280
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:26,010
It's good but when it's pathology, because of pathology you are quiet, then that is a symptom,

281
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:29,800
this is the symptom, this is the situation.

282
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:37,990
I have become very quiet, because of pathology, it's not my type.

283
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,390
And then it's a change, then it's pathology.

284
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:52,220
In spite of the fact this is considered to be a healthy quality.

285
00:43:52,320 --> 00:44:04,220
If somebody is calm inside and because of this calmness he feels quiet and never gets mad,

286
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:10,730
it's very fine, it's very good, this level is very healthy.

287
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:22,470
He says, I'm quiet because I can not do otherwise and perceives deep down inside some anger,

288
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,070
whatever it might be, feelings etc.
