1
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:29,050
-Please can you see to come? Can you come here? Please help her.

2
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,660
So you see the eye, just zoom the eye, she can not open it.

3
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,640
There is a swelling on the upper lid quite severe,

4
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:06,890
there is an inflammation on the margin of the lids

5
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:14,990
and the swelling seems to be quite edematous and the pain...

6
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:28,460
The swelling is coming up all the time, most probably it will reach quite...

7
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:48,870
Do you feel your eye is OK? I will open a little bit just to see.

8
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:53,060
Is it painful as I touch it?

9
00:01:54,070 --> 00:02:05,040
The eye is OK, the sting is on the eyelid and do you have pain?

10
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:30,570
-Yes and in my eye. More on the lid.
-There is a lot of water running.

11
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:50,970
If the eye was red and the lacrimation was burning, the remedy would have been Euphrasia.

12
00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:02,970
But the eye is not affected in this way, it is not red, it is painful,

13
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,940
she is very sensitive to touch, there is a tremendous swelling,

14
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:23,790
there is the stinging pain and therefore with some kind of confidence, not completely,

15
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,740
we can prescribe a dose of Apis.

16
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,870
-I was stung by wasp three weeks ago at home under the sole of my foot,

17
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,590
I had stepped on it and at first I took Apis and it got worse and then I took Ledum

18
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:25,040
and also bathed my foot in Ledum and it was good after one hour.

19
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,050
-Very good. Wait a moment.

20
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,210
-I feel worse enough already, I don't want it to aggravate in any way.

21
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:49,210
-Yes sure but what I want, did she develop a reaction to this wasp?

22
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,810
She was really bad, the foot became swelled up or a thing like that?

23
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:13,560
-The foot was this swollen and the pain was so strong that I could not walk anymore.

24
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:22,450
-That means she has an allergic reaction towards the sting,

25
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:30,810
so we have to be more on the alert for what might happen.

26
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:50,460
Since she has a remedy which has helped her before in a similar situation,

27
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,300
we first have to try that remedy, not Apis.

28
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:13,450
-In the Repertory in Generals we have wounds, bites, wasps which is Mezereum

29
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:21,060
and again Mezereum is aggravated by touch second degree

30
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:28,870
and we have wounds, painful, burning which is again Mezereum.

31
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:40,500
-You have to be careful when you read things like that. You have to be careful.

32
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:50,550
This is a case in which after a sting, a wound develops.

33
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,450
It inflames and then it opens and it develops into a wound.

34
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,870
Then you may be needing one of the remedies which is Mezereum

35
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:12,860
but at that stage where there is this allergy and because the lids are involved,

36
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,860
maybe still Apis may work.

37
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:23,040
But we can not give Apis at this moment since she tells us that in a previous situation

38
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,790
with a wasp she was treated with Ledum.

39
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:31,120
The remedy that has to be tried first is Ledum.

40
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,530
You should not go away from that remedy before we have tried this remedy.

41
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,530
If it does not work, we'll see what we will do, we'll see in the afternoon.

42
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:51,020
Whenever you give a remedy that has worked and there is a relapse of such a situation,

43
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,890
you try again the same remedy, this is the rule. So find Ledum here.

44
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:13,280
-What treatment did she get before? People were around giving her something, what was it?

45
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,050
-She said she got Apis and then Ledum.

46
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:24,850
-Three weeks ago, she wanted to know what about now, before when the wasp first stung.

47
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:33,500
-I don't know, it is something like mixture of certain flowers.

48
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,360
-Bach flowers, rescue remedy.

49
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:49,110
-Well what potency you have taken before?
-30.

50
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,860
-OK, give her 200 now.

51
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:03,840
-I would like to know how can we judge that Apis was not the remedy

52
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:11,850
because the first reaction was that it got worse and we know that if it is the right remedy,

53
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,200
it gets worse.
-That's correct.

54
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:23,680
-How can we know now if Ledum... perhaps Ledum didn't have any reaction.

55
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:28,530
-Yes sure. I will tell you.

56
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:41,430
The answer is like this. If the patient says a story, you have to believe the story.

57
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:48,180
What you say is absolutely correct, that means it might have been that Apis aggravating

58
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,430
and then eventually curing.

59
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:59,180
Now we are going to have the proof because she says no I don't want to be aggravated.

60
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,920
The fact that she will take Apis and she will be aggravated again,

61
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,920
we may have the same problem.

62
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:13,120
So therefore we have for different reasons, for psychological reasons also

63
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:22,860
and for reasons that if what she tells is objective, we have to start with Ledum.

64
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,110
Because if she says, as soon as I took Ledum, I felt better.

65
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:42,130
So that means that what she says, it might be correct, we shall find out how Ledum will act.

66
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,220
In the afternoon we shall see.

67
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:08,130
Peter take her back where she lives.

68
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:29,890
-One question. There is a specific remedy which is made of wasp...

69
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,280
Can we try this remedy as well?
-I don't know.

70
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:54,060
If this was just a wasp, as usual, you just forget about it but if she has a sensitivity

71
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,540
forget about these little measures.

72
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:05,050
Then you have really to go deeper and do something correct.

73
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:14,800
So her eye will open by tomorrow evening.

74
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:32,450
I'm not sure that Ledum is acting but the pain goes away in such cases once the swelling is full.

75
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:44,950
Once the swelling is full, that means it's not anymore swelling up, then the pain stops

76
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,220
and starts reducing.

77
00:12:47,320 --> 00:13:00,370
By tomorrow evening her eye will be open, whether because of the remedy or natural I'm not sure.

78
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:11,540
This is the natural, if you left it without any remedy, still you will have the same process.

79
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,960
It will be impressive of course if we give the remedy

80
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:26,300
and by now the swelling will be almost gone.

81
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:34,440
That we could say is because of the remedy definitely but now as we saw the swelling

82
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:41,430
became bigger and bigger and bigger, reached a point where the organism does not react anymore,

83
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:49,190
then the pain stops and then starts the reverse order. By tomorrow night...

84
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:57,290
Still you will see some swelling, not completely gone.

85
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:05,040
What would happen if she had taken Apis, we do not know.

86
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,300
Do not think that Apis would be better, no. We don't know.
