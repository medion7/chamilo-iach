1
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:33,850
-Mainly grief and depression, confusion and forgetfulness, not being able to work.

2
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,710
-So much?
-For many years.

3
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:44,860
-Why? What happened?
-A long story.

4
00:00:49,320 --> 00:01:00,980
Mostly the upbringing, the childhood but also when I was 13 years old I got much worse.

5
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:14,050
I suddenly got caries in my teeth and going to the dentist all the time

6
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:21,650
and all this amalgam and after that this confusion and trembling and always hungry.

7
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,480
-But you are not, you eat a lot but you are thin.

8
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,830
So you have no problem eating a lot.
-Not so much.

9
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:50,040
-What remedies you have taken?
-I don't remember.

10
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:12,960
In 1984 I took several remedies. A therapist that diagnoses from the tongue,

11
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,600
she was giving me so much remedies and she did not know about Homeopathy

12
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,230
and at that time I didn't know either.

13
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:31,190
So I had 13 remedies at the same time and repeated every day, whole boxes all together

14
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,800
and I don't really remember.

15
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,490
All different things and she said this is the way to give me minerals.

16
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,430
-So you had lack of minerals and she had lack of brains.

17
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:57,420
-It was also Silica and Nat mur. I mixed all together.

18
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,770
-Already 13 years ago.

19
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,420
How old are you now?
-41.

20
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,740
-So you were 28 when you started with this nonsense and at 30 years old

21
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,580
you went to deterioration.

22
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,670
-No, this started with this teeth problem at 13.

23
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:39,490
But not much happened after all these remedies and in 1986 I also got

24
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,180
several remedies at one time.

25
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,660
-Again from a similar person who diagnoses on what?

26
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,260
-No she was a homeopath.

27
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,270
-What remedies did you get?

28
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:17,500
-That time I don't remember but in 1989 I took Ignatia D200 and it was for every day

29
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,680
for a month.

30
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:34,010
-And also another crazy person gave me Mercurius D12 and I repeated every 30 min.

31
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,640
5 days, 2 boxes, every day.

32
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:50,600
-For 1 month or what?
-2 boxes.

33
00:04:50,700 --> 00:05:00,700
-What it means?
-I can't remember, I was completely confused.

34
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,190
-And then?

35
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:15,370
-Then a homeopath in 1994 gave me Medorrhinum 200 and after he gave me

36
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:41,120
Carcinosin 1M and then Sulphur 1M. In may 1995 I got Aurum 1M,

37
00:05:41,220 --> 00:06:03,820
I took Rhus tox 200 and Calc. carb. D200 and Arsenicum 200.

38
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,910
Now at first of April I took Phos D200.

39
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:15,660
-You prescribed yourself these remedies?

40
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:25,640
-No, some of them. The Phos and Arsen and Calc but I was in communication

41
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,590
with my homeopath.

42
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,990
-He agreed.
-Yes.

43
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:51,250
-But you say you gave up working? When did you give up working?

44
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,030
-I actually never started.

45
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,410
-Because of that confusion?
-Tiredness.

46
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:14,930
-What exactly do you feel?
-Tired, no energy. Grief and depression.

47
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:25,270
-Why grief? You have your parents, they are alive?
-Yes.

48
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,870
-They live together?
-Yes.

49
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,920
-Brothers, sisters?
-I have a younger brother yes.

50
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,700
-He is OK?
-Yes, he is fine.

51
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,750
-And did you go to school?
-Yes.

52
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:56,530
-Did you pass classes?
-Yes, amazingly.

53
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:05,950
I was looking out of the window and I was just daydreaming, I did not pay attention.

54
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:20,100
-What do you like to do mostly?
-I like to dance very much and sing.

55
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,280
-When you dance you feel good?
-I feel better yes.

56
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,590
-But not good.

57
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:43,920
-I used to do but these late years I got more tired and then I can not enjoy to dance

58
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,030
that much as I used to do.

59
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:57,190
So now I try to put myself together and force to do things, I'm not really enjoy that much.

60
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:05,610
-Emotionally how you are? Did you have an affair with a man?

61
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,950
-I have almost 18 years living together with a man.

62
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:31,610
-You are with this man?
-No, this relationship ended 7 years ago.

63
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:50,930
-That means you were together with him from the age of 19 to 36.

64
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,900
-Yes.

65
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:07,260
-Why it ended? What happened? You liked another man or you went with another man?

66
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:15,660
-He left but actually I wanted to leave him for many years because it was not good for me.

67
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,450
I wanted to end the relationship.

68
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:27,960
-Why?
-He suppressed me very much.

69
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,300
-By what? By shouting?

70
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:45,770
-Psychologically, he told me not to do this, not to go to these friends, he was very jealous

71
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,460
and he wanted me home.

72
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:59,950
-And you could not get away from this man because of your lack of self confidence?

73
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:09,040
-Yes and because he was begging me, he was so afraid that I leave.

74
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:17,300
-Finally you left him or you made him leave you?

75
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:24,440
-You can put it that way, when I told him that now this is final, I go,

76
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:35,700
then he changed completely his personality and then in a couple of days he found another woman

77
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,550
and then he left without much talking.

78
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,470
-Did you find another man?
-No.

79
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,720
-You didn't want.
-Not so much.

80
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:05,950
-You did not have this sexual drive or because you felt tired to be with somebody or you

81
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:14,300
had no desire for sex at all, no desire to get involved?

82
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:26,780
-Mostly I was scared of... he had been lying so much.

83
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,810
-To you or to anybody else?

84
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:40,780
-To many people. I suddenly realized that he has a psychopathic behavior

85
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,220
and I felt like my whole life had been a lie.

86
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:57,380
-So after these 7 years you never tried to have an affair?

87
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,750
-I tried.

88
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:05,710
-And you did not succeed?
-It was not the right person.

89
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:16,700
-Who was not the right person? The original one or the one you met after?

90
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:24,380
-No, I met another person and it is not the right person for me.

91
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:31,470
-After how long you found out?
-About a year after.

92
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:40,550
-So you had actually an affair with another man and another one also later on?

93
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:49,120
-It was a little earlier, just a short one.

94
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:56,730
-It was a short one and then this of 1 year, still you felt it was not the right person.

95
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:07,230
All these separations affected you?
-Sure.

96
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,450
-You cried or you were depressed?

97
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,880
-Of course after 18 years with this man it was terrible.

98
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,970
-You cried?
-Much.

99
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:29,060
-And did you tell your brother or your mother, did you discuss with anybody?

100
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,400
-Not much.

101
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,330
-You didn't want to or you didn't have the confidence?

102
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:50,300
-I did not have much communication with my parents, so I told them

103
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:58,670
only one and a half month afterwards this happened, so I tried to manage alone.

104
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,150
-Now you are living alone, not with your parents?
-Yes, not with my parents.

105
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,730
-And how do you support yourself since you don't work? You are on a pension?

106
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,580
-Yes.

107
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:34,060
-How is your memory? If you read something do you remember?

108
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,590
-Not very much. One day and I forget what I read the day before.

109
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:51,330
-Totally you forget?
-Yes and that makes the confidence low.

110
00:15:53,330 --> 00:16:00,730
-And you are in this apartment in Oslo?
-Outside of Oslo.

111
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,080
-In the suburb.

112
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,500
You are not afraid staying by yourself?
-No.

113
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,500
-You like it actually, to be by yourself?
-Yes.

114
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,580
-Your sleep is good?

115
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:43,570
-No, that's one of the biggest problems because I never get refreshed at sleep.

116
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,670
-Unrefreshed always?
-Unrefreshed always.

117
00:16:48,370 --> 00:17:04,580
When I get up in the morning is like a comatose. I need a couple of hours to just drink tea.

118
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:16,030
And my whole life I turn night to day and day to night, I switch.

119
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,770
-You stay in the night awake and then you sleep during the day.

120
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,710
-Yes.

121
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:32,630
-You cry easily?
-Yes.

122
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:42,210
-But you say you cry easily, you can cry?
-Yes definitely.

123
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:00,530
-When do you feel better? Do you feel better in the night? More awake?

124
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:07,710
-Yes, more awake and better in general.

125
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,780
-Do you have any discharge from the vagina like leucorrhea?

126
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,790
-Not much, seldom.

127
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:30,120
-Did you have discharge and you took some medicine for that?

128
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:36,970
-No. But I have had condylomata.

129
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:46,720
-And you cauterized them?
-Not took away but something very strong.

130
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:52,290
-Like podophylline, you put something on?
-Some liquid yes.

131
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,200
-And then they disappeared?
-Yes.

132
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:01,210
-Where? In the vagina?
-Not inside. Outside.

133
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,440
-Did you have warts on your fingers?

134
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:25,030
-Not on the fingers but under my foot I had a couple of warts and after Medorrhinum,

135
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,140
I think, they went away.

136
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,380
-It was on the sole underneath?
-Yes.

137
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:41,860
-Did you feel better with any of these medicines?
-Yes, I didn't actually finished.

138
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,620
After Phos I took recently and Phos did change much.

139
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,870
-To the better?

140
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:02,370
-I was little better with the depression but I got pneumonia, bronchitis,

141
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:08,970
after Phos these came.

142
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,030
-And how you treated this?

143
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:24,370
-My homeopath gave me Nat sulph and I repeated once and after repeating

144
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:29,130
I was very very depressed, suicidal.

145
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:44,640
That was 5 days before I come here and then I took Sulphur and then my lungs are better.

146
00:20:50,640 --> 00:21:00,980
-Did you ever try to commit suicide really?
-I wanted once.

147
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,810
-What age?
-25.

148
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:17,460
-Why? Do you remember why?
-I was in a deep depression for 5 years.

149
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,960
-Because of this man?

150
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:27,210
-And also very much of my parents, no communication.

151
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:35,110
-Because you felt they don't love or you don't have the attention of them?

152
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,210
-I felt hatred.

153
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,540
-By them?
-By my mother.

154
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:52,380
-Your mother hated you because your father loved you or something like this?

155
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,870
-No, I don't think so.

156
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:07,530
-Your father also?
-My father was very influenced by my mother.

157
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:14,710
When she was so angry with me, he also got angry with me. He was worshipping her.

158
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:24,890
-And you felt that you worth nothing.
-Yes, I felt abused psychologically.

159
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:37,120
-You never reacted? You never said bad words, swearing at them or returning back their abuse?

160
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,470
-Sometimes.

161
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:46,220
-With your boyfriend did you fight back?
-Yes.

162
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,710
-Physically?
-No.

163
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,480
-Never physically. He was stronger than you?

164
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:05,630
So when he said something bad to you, you said also bad things for him?

165
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,890
-Yes sometimes.

166
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:18,510
-Who was saying more? It was always him who was saying the last word

167
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:24,790
and you had to shut up or he had to shut up because you were?

168
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:31,040
-No, it was very difficult to communicate with him because it was like talking to the wall.

169
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:37,060
He would just go and no reaction.

170
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:27,720
But I isolated myself very much because I'm so sensitive to the surroundings.

171
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:43,980
-In what way? You feel the emotions of others or the thoughts?

172
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,730
-Very often.

173
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:59,050
-You seem as if you want to cry now, is it true?

174
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:07,790
-Yes because this makes me feel so hopeless because it's the story of my life

175
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:19,490
and also I try not to look at newspapers and at news because all this suffering, I cannot take.

176
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:49,240
But I grew up with a mother who was very dictatorial and wanted to control me.

177
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:58,070
-And what you did?
-I tried to fight back.

178
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:04,070
-At what age you left home?
-18.

179
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:11,800
-Until that time did you take drugs with your friends? You tried marihuana?

180
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,740
-A little and then sniffing glue.

181
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:37,980
-And what were your experiences with these drugs? You had good experiences,

182
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,820
bad experiences or no experiences?
-Good.

183
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:52,560
-So you did it every day?
-Not every day, just for a short time.

184
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:59,320
-For a period of 1 year? When it was this time that you were?

185
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:08,070
-From 17-18 years old I tried some marihuana and this glue.

186
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:16,720
-LSD?
-No, cocaine but not much.

187
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:26,300
-Now you are totally out of this? Do you feel that these drugs have done some damage?

188
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:37,410
-Yes and I also I could not sleep so I was taking sleeping pills for 15 years

189
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:49,990
and also a lot of anti-depressive and a lot of alcohol mixed together.

190
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:00,750
But that was mostly 10 years ago.

191
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:07,400
-Now you don't take alcohol, not at all?
-I try not to.

192
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,330
-You take from time to time?
-If I take a little, I want more.

193
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,720
-What about marihuana? You take sometimes?
-No.

194
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,980
-Why? Are you afraid?

195
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,470
-Yes, I felt it was not good for my health, I get more and more tired.

196
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,730
-Do you ever have this feeling of getting crazy?

197
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:49,330
-Maybe. I like to be around people who are a bit crazy because then I can be more...

198
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:06,250
-You are going to panic states?
-No, resignation.

199
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,490
-Never mind, whatever might happen, will happen. Like this?

200
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:21,060
-It was like this but now even though I don't want to live, I feel I can't end my life, it's not

201
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:30,220
right. So it's like everything is a struggle, to get up in the morning, to come here is a

202
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:40,820
struggle. So I force myself very much to be able to do very small things.

203
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,160
-Do you like to eat sweets?
-Yes.

204
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,720
-What about salty things?

205
00:29:52,820 --> 00:30:01,320
-I eat more salt now but before was not much. But now I drink more.

206
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,480
-You drink more after Phos?

207
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:14,660
-No, it was after Arsenicum I started drinking more and a little bit more salt.

208
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:19,580
-But always you liked sweets?

209
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:27,900
-Yes, I feel my blood sugar dropping and then I need something to take.

210
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,670
-What you feel is the first thing you would like to get rid of.

211
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,330
-I want more energy so I can work.

212
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,560
-But what about the mind? The mind you want to be more clear or you want

213
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:56,910
to have more confidence or you want the memory to come back or to remember things?

214
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,410
-The grief.

215
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:12,830
-You like fruits? You take?
-Not much.

216
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:21,820
Less and less and I think I can not. If I eat fruits, I feel uncomfortable,

217
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,750
I get more hungry from eating fruits.

218
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:37,590
-But you have to eat and feel better.
-Yes and I have to eat in the night also.

219
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:44,570
-For what? For the emptiness of the stomach or what, just out of boredom?

220
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:49,580
-No, for the emptiness and a sudden hunger, very sudden.

221
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,140
And sometimes if I don't eat I can faint.

222
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:05,310
-You have fainted sometimes, many times?

223
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:18,610
-Just a couple but I also had when I was 20 years I had anorexia and bulimia

224
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:26,710
and I took a lot of diuretica and then I fainted.

225
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:36,640
I had to control it and sit down so I didn't faint. So I took a lot of laxatives.

226
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:47,390
This is a long time ago but I still feel my digestive system disturbed.

227
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:11,730
-Show me your tongue. It's usually white?
-A little bit in the back maybe?

228
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,560
-In the sides?
-No.

229
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:34,460
But when I eat food I very often get my pulse rate very much and especially

230
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:45,720
like sugar or coffee, alcohol, tea makes the heart go fast and the pulse can go...

231
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,810
-You feel exhausted, you feel so tired?
-Yes.

232
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,710
-How is your sex drive?

233
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:15,370
You have sexual desire?
-Yes.

234
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:20,410
-Strong?
-No, medium I guess.

235
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:26,890
-How do you manage since you don't have a boyfriend?

236
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:35,480
-I did after this relationship, I had less sex drive.

237
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:44,210
-Which relationship made you feel worse? The first?

238
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,450
The grief was coming from this?
-Yes, yes.

239
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,710
-The second, the one year relationship also brought you grief?

240
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:00,650
-Not so much.

241
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,630
-You didn't care so much.
-We were more like friends.

242
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,820
I found out this was a friendship.

243
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:12,220
-Do you paint?

244
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:28,650
-I want to, I want to express but it's hard to express. It's like the creativity is very blocked.

245
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:43,050
-When you speak on your own language, do you sometimes forget words?

246
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:49,720
-The name of things yes. It feels terrible.

247
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,990
-As if the mind is blank.

248
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:03,150
-My head always feels very light, as if it is all empty, as if the brain is out there somewhere.

249
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:21,310
There was a time like I was meditating much and then I felt like leaving the body

250
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:27,570
and I looked at the watch and it was 5 hours and I thought that maybe 1 hour had gone.

251
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,010
-And you were on another level.
-Yes.

252
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:35,060
-Have you been taking drugs during that time?
-No.

253
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:56,400
-Meditating on what?
-I wanted to get closer to god.

254
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,740
-But you were meditating with the idea of coming out of your body?

255
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:09,970
You were doing repetition? What you were doing? Or you just sat down?

256
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:17,470
-I just sat down and listened to a music and then I go out in the nature

257
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:23,830
and I could feel being one with everything.

258
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,600
-When it was that?

259
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:37,300
-It was very much in the last 5-6 years with this long relationship, with this man.

260
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:46,660
He was like manipulating me, you hear this, I was like brainwashed from this.

261
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:51,060
-He was saying what to do. He was like a guru to you?

262
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:59,650
-Not a guru but he made me believe that he had some kind of contact and when ...

263
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,690
-And you wanted also the contact.

264
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:16,330
-Yes but there were times when I thought that this was not right and it's difficult to tell

265
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:25,720
but he suddenly changed very much after I wanted to leave him and I think

266
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,340
he went into schizophrenia I think.

267
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:47,900
But I have suppressed very much a lot of things because he always made me think that

268
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,220
everything was my fault, so I don't think much about it.

269
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,660
Once he tried to strangulate me and he made me feel this also was my fault.

270
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:09,490
-He tried to strangulate you and he said that it is your fault that he did that.

271
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:14,980
-Yes he made me feel that. So I don't even talk about it.

272
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:21,340
-You made him so angry to do it.
-He just reacted.

273
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,810
-During that time when he wanted to strangulate you, what did you do to him?

274
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:32,910
-He was scared by a sudden...

275
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:42,640
We were quarreling and I was angry and I throw away something,

276
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:55,640
not towards him and this broke into pieces and one piece he thought,

277
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:02,670
he just started because he thought it maybe could hit him but I throw it the other way.

278
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:13,070
And he reacted just like an animal, this is the first time all these years I saw him react

279
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,490
and that he wanted to kill.

280
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:25,750
And at that time somebody rang the bell, otherwise I could not breathe I could not talk, nothing.

281
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,320
-He meant it.

282
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:38,140
-Somebody came by chance, somebody that I haven't seen for 4 years, he never come

283
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:47,890
and then he came back to himself and he also told me that he didn't dare to be angry

284
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:51,080
because he didn't know what he could do.

285
00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:00,750
But this I did not talk about, I thought this was my problem.

286
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:28,230
-When you had an affair with him, sexually you were very alive?

287
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:35,080
-Yes but he also wanted to control that, he wanted to control everything.

288
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:41,080
-The way you were doing sex or what?
-When.

289
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:49,160
-And, according to you, it was too little or too much?

290
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:54,580
-Several years he didn't want touch.

291
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:04,230
-And then he said that he got a message that he had to grow spiritually

292
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:06,830
and blah, blah, blah so he could not touch.

293
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:13,750
-So you did not have any contact for several years.

294
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,000
What you did, your sexual energy

295
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:24,310
what you were doing with it?
-I had a couple of affairs at that time.

296
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:31,080
-And he knew it?
-Yes I told him.

297
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:38,070
-And you were very active?

298
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:42,650
You needed to have sex every day 2-3 times?
-No.

299
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:49,250
-How much?
-It's changeable.

300
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,320
-You could have sex if you like this man,

301
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:03,400
you could have sex 3-4 times the day?
-No.

302
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,180
-Not so much.

303
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:12,080
If you did not have sex, did you have to masturbate?

304
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,650
-Sometimes yes.

305
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:18,340
-A lot?
-No.

306
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:28,590
-But you felt you had to release this energy or you did it out of boredom?

307
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,840
You do not know.

308
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:59,870
The first remedy which comes here in the repertorization is Platina and then it's Cocculus

309
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,800
and then Staphysagria and Nat mur.

310
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,740
You took Staphysagria?
-No.

311
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,630
-Platina, Cocculus? No.

312
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:32,610
-Did you put sighing?
-Yes, I feel I don't get enough air, never.

313
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:37,960
Sometimes I feel so tired that I have to think I have to breathe because I just want

314
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:42,050
to breathe out and disappear.

315
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:57,050
When I wake up in the morning I'm breathing very fast like if I've been running.

316
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:20,950
But I feel what has affected me most is my mother, the hatred, the feeling of abandonment

317
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:26,240
and forsaken feelings and all this, this is what's bothering me most.

318
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,980
What ameliorates very much is being with animals.

319
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:20,300
-You like especially dogs or cats or any animal?
-Any animal.

320
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:49,880
I also feel very much hurry inside and so much guilt and shame,

321
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:55,020
the guilt feeling is very strong.

322
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,220
-Guilt for what?
-Not working.

323
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:17,970
I feel that I should be more able to do much out of my life and I feel very much guilt

324
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:30,720
and shame, hopelessness and despair, all these.

325
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:44,860
-But which is the most disturbing feeling for you, the sadness, the depression or the fact

326
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,360
that you can not push yourself to do something.

327
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:56,250
-Yes but then many things, I want to work.

328
00:47:56,350 --> 00:48:00,470
-To do something and you can not.
-Yes.

329
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:23,660
I'm always very cold.
-Very cold?

330
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:55,630
There is another thing that I really want to get help and that is osteoporosis.

331
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,240
-You have that also?

332
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,240
-And my back started to degenerate very early.

333
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:22,470
-Do you sometimes get a clairvoyant feeling? When you see something it's going to happen

334
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,570
for others or for yourself?

335
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:33,890
-Just a little bit, I had a couple of dreams that came true but also

336
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:38,410
that I can feel very much the vibrations.

337
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:47,140
-Tell me your emotions are alive or are tired like your body?

338
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,140
You have emotions?
-Yes I think so.

339
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:59,740
-Your emotions are quite strong? Mostly painful emotions?

340
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:10,670
-I can also be very accelerated, excited and accelerated.

341
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,660
-Do you have any fear?

342
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:27,420
-I had 2 car accidents and after that I'm a little afraid to drive motorbike or a car.

343
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:32,150
-Other fear? You used to have fears?

344
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:41,160
-From high places I used to have. I used to want to jump but now this is not so much.

345
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,160
-Other fears you used to have?
-No.

346
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:55,910
And there was something happening that gets me... I did not have fear of death

347
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:13,400
but something happened. 4 years ago that I was so much detached from the body

348
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,500
and I could not control, I could not come back.

349
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:23,470
-There was a time when you were out of the body and you could not come back

350
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:28,650
and then the fear came, fear of dying.

351
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:35,010
-Because usually I was seeing nice places, with nice color but this time it was just

352
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:50,300
black grayish and it was like nowhere. It was terrible and I could not move my body.

353
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,240
And after that I don't relax very good because I feel that the way I can balance

354
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:16,390
is to someway be in a day dream or being out of my body because it has been too painful...

355
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:18,990
-To be in the reality.

356
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:29,480
-Yes. But after this thing happened, I try to be more here,

357
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:34,230
in the present but it's very difficult.

358
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:41,240
-The other situation scared you very much? It was like a process of dying.

359
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:49,060
-Yes it was. I felt I really gone but at that time I made a decision because

360
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:58,230
I was longing for death and I was triggering and pushing it to the edge very much

361
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:07,580
and then I had this experience and I said, I'm gonna try, I want to live.

362
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,500
So it changed many things.

363
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:20,330
I also had another experience with this and it was like being with a group of people and

364
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:26,730
we were and somebody was taking us back to the time...

365
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:35,580
-The time of birth?
-The time in the womb.

366
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,150
-And what you experienced?

367
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:59,150
-The most terrifying, it was like torture because I could not be in there and she put on

368
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:12,590
a record of how the child can hear and the heartbeat of the mother and this was unbearable.

369
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:24,990
-She was a psychologist, a therapist?

370
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:30,570
-A therapist and all the other people had just nice experiences and I was crying, crying

371
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:37,070
and I said to myself, I was hiding underneath the blanket, I tried not to disturb the others

372
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:46,830
I said I have to go through this but then I leave my body there. Then I also had that out of

373
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:53,680
body experience because this heartbeat was unbearable.

374
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,240
-Did you feel that your mother had bad feelings?

375
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:07,450
-Yes I told you, I feel this hatred from her so strong.

376
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:09,850
-Already from that period you mean.

377
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:18,660
-I had decided to take Ignatia or Nat mur to do something with the grief and then

378
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:25,080
at that night I dreamed, the whole sky was lightening Phosphorus, Phosphorus,

379
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:29,830
that I should take Phosphorus.

380
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:32,680
-So you took Phosphorus?
-Yes.

381
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,840
-You are not a simple case.
-I know.

382
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:23,670
-About this case I think that the initial cause of the problem is the hatred of the mother.

383
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:34,920
She repeats many times the mother etc. and it affected in very early age and after that

384
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:40,770
the stress is continuing to the relations with the boyfriend or husband

385
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:44,350
and is going on and on and she gets weaker and weaker.

386
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:54,330
-The stress is on emotional level where the organism has decided to place most of

387
00:56:54,430 --> 00:57:05,020
the disturbance on the mental level, therefore is a confusion and weak, I can't work.

388
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:15,340
What is your worse problem? I can't work, I feel guilty but these are the side effects

389
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,270
of not being able to concentrate, not being able to think.

390
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:29,000
-Isn't possible that the mental level was so much affected because of the drugs?

391
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,920
Because very sensible people if they take drugs...

392
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:37,380
-Yes correct. Here the stress is not only emotional because she goes to different other

393
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:47,710
stresses and she takes the hallucinogenic drugs and what other stresses she has mentioned.

394
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:57,630
-Alcohol.
-Yes alcohol plus drugs.

395
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,630
-Remedies.

396
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:23,340
-Yes this is the worst, plus the remedies. Now all this came through the physical body.

397
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:30,680
The stress came from physical body but the physical body transferred the stress,

398
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:38,520
she didn't have a liver problem, she has a problem on the mental level.

399
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:47,600
The stress, alcohol and drugs is on the physical body but the final effect is on the mental

400
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:55,030
and then remedies which are beyond the mental.

401
00:58:55,130 --> 00:59:05,280
Mental-emotional-physical and here is the vital force and the remedies affect here directly

402
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:10,510
and then the body distributes the disturbance.

403
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:26,490
And it goes like this, more, more, more it distributes in the way it can do the best.

404
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,650
So disturbance of the remedies is on the vital force.

405
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:43,480
-When she was 13 she received a lot of fillings with amalgam and she said after that

406
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,990
the confusion started.

407
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,650
-I'm not sure about that.

408
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:39,160
Don't forget, otherwise we will be confused, what we're discussing is mental-emotional.

409
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:45,640
I see 65% of the class says it's mental. Why is mental?

410
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:55,040
There is a possibility of the amalgam and she says, after amalgam I felt... alright

411
01:00:55,140 --> 01:01:04,460
but there is a but and the but is that according to some people what they said is,

412
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:13,720
some disturbance has preceded the caries so therefore we can not attribute everything

413
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,710
to the amalgam. That's one.

414
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:20,120
The second is, which I would like to answer this question,

415
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:30,230
this person answering your questions he says, I did not see the problem on the mental level.

416
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:34,880
So why she was answering the questions?

417
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:45,810
Is this a mental disturbance we're going to treat or primarily...

418
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:54,310
If you remember I asked her, how are your emotions? Do you have emotions?

419
01:01:54,410 --> 01:02:08,750
She says, I have. I said, they are quite alive? Quite alive.

420
01:02:10,740 --> 01:02:22,390
Then don't forget that she is talking, as somebody says, she is talking for this inability

421
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:32,480
to concentrate from very young age. So this level is already affected from very young age.

422
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,560
She was not aware.

423
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:43,060
Most probably whatever emotional issues are here today, which she is clear,

424
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:58,060
my mother hates me, this issue is clear but she said, I had some suicidal thoughts

425
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:09,900
but what was happening my mind went out of my body, I went out of my body and in this

426
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:18,320
I realized certain things and I came back and I said, forget this issue of going out.

427
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:29,320
So the issue from very early age is the issue of not being able to concentrate,

428
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:41,230
a weak mind. These are facts which 65% of the class saw these facts, all right.

429
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:47,730
This is how you should go about trying to see whether you can help this person

430
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:51,200
by a remedy and what might be the indicated remedy.

431
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:55,480
Can anybody tell me why she answered my questions?

432
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:12,870
He says, well I can not see any mental problem with her or much less, I see more emotional.

433
01:04:12,970 --> 01:04:21,210
Why? Because she has answered your questions. She was with you, understood your question

434
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:24,390
and answered to the best of her ability.

435
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:35,230
Can anybody from observing the video tell me why she was able to do that?

436
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:45,210
-It seemed to me during the consultation that she was desperate to get the right remedy

437
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:52,880
from you, you could see her eyes, she was pleading with you all the time.

438
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:58,540
-She was all there. Can she live with that intention all her life,

439
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:04,880
she can muster everything for 1 hour because it's a matter of life and death,

440
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:09,640
you see her eyes how intense they were.

441
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:15,640
That is mustering everything which is possible to understand the question and

442
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:22,220
answer the question as much as possible. Can you live in this condition?

443
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:27,570
Normally is you see her now she is not looking like that.

444
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:41,550
The next question that we're dealing is, whether this case is treatable, yes or no?

445
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:53,050
Can we treat this case or we shall leave this case free of any remedy for about a year

446
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:59,140
perhaps, to see what settles down in this case?

447
01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:17,060
Before we answer this question, maybe you may say we must find out whether a remedy

448
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:25,600
is apparent in her case. If a remedy is apparent then we can give it. If it is clear we can

449
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:36,110
give it, no problem. Now in her case is a remedy apparent? Clear?

450
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:42,570
I mean you say, we don't have enough experience and therefore I have to answer

451
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:48,060
this question for you and say, no her case is not clear.

452
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:53,830
Her case is very confused from all points of view.

453
01:06:55,070 --> 01:06:59,580
It is confused because of the hallucinogenic drugs? I don't know.

454
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,560
From alcohol? I don't know. From other remedies? I don't know.

455
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:07,390
From mental-emotional shocks? I don't know. From all of them?

456
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:15,820
Most probably, all of them have contributed in her state, all these stresses, mental,

457
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,300
emotional, physical stresses have contributed into bringing about this.

458
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:29,180
The problem is that she took several remedies in high and low potency repeatedly

459
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:37,700
and that creates what I have said many times a state of weakening of the mind

460
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,990
and weakening of the body.

461
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:48,910
-George I put 24 symptoms in the computer and under the first 20 remedies there was

462
01:07:49,010 --> 01:07:51,950
not one remedy which fits the case. It's a totally confused case.

463
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:59,120
-Then I turned on the computer when I was enquiring about Platina, you remember?

464
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:05,950
Because computer in the analysis was showing first remedy Platina and second remedy

465
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:17,890
Cocculus which is interesting possibility of course. And then the third possibility Nux vom.

466
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:23,130
-She didn't say anything about vertigo.

467
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:29,290
-She never said but the computer analysis showed Cocculus as a first remedy and then

468
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:35,620
it became second and then Platina came up as a possibility and I was enquiring about

469
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:41,400
the possibility of Platina and I pressurized her a little bit more than I should.

470
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:50,060
Did you enquire whether she had gonorrhea ever?

471
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:57,060
-Condylomata.

472
01:08:57,810 --> 01:09:09,480
-But real prime gonorrhea?
-Not that I know.

473
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:11,560
-You would know if you get.

474
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:30,640
I have to make too many comments. You say why yes, I will say why not in each remedy.

475
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:40,710
My problem with Cannabis indica is that Cannabis is full of delusions in that state

476
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:50,710
where the mental is involved. She has a lot of delusions. She did not mention delusions.

477
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:57,650
The going out of the body is typical of Cannabis Ind.

478
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:05,050
Also I did not see with her where there are no delusions, there are a lot of theories,

479
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:09,460
theorizing. I will tell you why I have this why I have that.

480
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:13,540
I also did not notice that element for Cannabis Ind.

481
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:18,790
That's why I was enquiring about Cann. Ind. then my mind went away.

482
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:22,220
The same with Phos acid which are good prescriptions.

483
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:33,800
Phos acid I was thinking in the beginning. The problem with Phos acid is that affects

484
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:41,050
mostly the emotions. You can not say that yes the emotions are also affected.

485
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:49,740
No, Phos acid has to affect 75% the emotions. Here, 60 or 70% is the mental

486
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,680
and the emotion is 40%.

487
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:59,410
So the impact is more on the mental level which goes for Cannabis indica.

488
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:10,250
Cann indica affects mental level, much more than the emotional but I said why not this.

489
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:25,410
Staphysagria is a good prescription because she repeated said she has been suppressed

490
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:33,830
by the husband, 18 years actually is your husband and by the mother, father whoever.

491
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:51,240
If we go Medorrhinum, there is a strong symptom for Medorrhinum which is feeling better

492
01:11:51,340 --> 01:12:01,690
in the evening, it's very strong for Medorrhinum plus the condylomata.

493
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:06,780
Did you take Medor already?
-Yes.

494
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:16,210
-So she took. So Medor did not have an effect. She took Phos. Did you take Nat mur?

495
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:23,940
-It was long time ago when I took all these remedies together,

496
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,310
I think Nat mur was one of those.

497
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:42,990
-With Agaricus I have the problem that I did not see the anxiety and the fear of cancer.

498
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:50,020
Fear of cancer was not there, the anxiety and the hypochondriacal thing about health

499
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:57,110
I did not perceive. With Phos she took Phos and we saw the result.

500
01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:02,360
Are you happy with the results? Some people may say, what we can do? Maybe we cannot do better.

501
01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:12,110
I'm not happy with this result and Cocculus is a good prescription because it has this slowness,

502
01:13:12,210 --> 01:13:18,710
as she shows but Cocculus usually has the dizziness which she is lacking.

503
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:35,600
Carcinosin, Platina we reason out, we took it out. Anhalonium is an interesting possibility,

504
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:48,610
especially if she has said she had some kind of ecstatic state. It is really a remedy

505
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:59,970
which goes out of the body and has some experiences but here what I was concerned is ...

506
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:28,360
I read from a remedy. Lack of will power, disinclined to work, they don't like to work

507
01:14:38,300 --> 01:15:00,210
muscular debility, heavy tired feeling, weakness on the mental level, brain fag,

508
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:16,470
great weakness, tired, heavy feeling all over, especially the limbs, worse exertion.

509
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:44,060
Brain fag with sexual excitement.

510
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:08,130
The remedy for me which is somewhat indicated at this moment is to strengthen this area

511
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:16,370
which we say, it's very weak, she can not concentrate.

512
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:23,370
It is a remedy that we give to people who are mentally tired. They have students,

513
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:31,120
they have worked very hard and then the brain gives up, it says I'm not going to learn anything,

514
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:35,720
I can not learn anything, I just don't want to learn anything more.

515
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:39,550
It's not possible for me to perceive anymore information.

516
01:16:41,060 --> 01:16:45,720
Which is this remedy which we give in such cases?

517
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,130
Picric acid.

518
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:11,120
So in these cases when we see this brain fag, she says if I put some energy I will do it.

519
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:17,970
Then I collapse. She said it very well this lady who described her case.

520
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:26,710
They put all the energy which is left, the students and then they collapse

521
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:29,310
and you give Picric acid and they continue.

522
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:40,300
Now Picric acid is it going to be a remedy with dramatic results or very impressive

523
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:50,450
results? No. It's going slowly to strengthen that area with the possibility of reducing the

524
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:59,260
effect on the mental level and the next remedy might be apparent or more apparent.

525
01:18:01,220 --> 01:18:07,450
If she develops some delusions, then she may go into Cann indica, if she goes out

526
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:17,040
of the body all the time, if she develops this or that she may go to another remedy

527
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:28,730
and slowly somebody has said, she needs constant attention, constant  careful attention.

528
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:43,370
So slowly within 3 years she may gain back her mental strength. With Picric acid

529
01:18:43,470 --> 01:18:49,790
she may even go to work but this is not all, she may have to do a lot of work

530
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:55,130
because the mental level then will appear, the problems and then it is the time.

531
01:18:55,230 --> 01:19:04,790
Why Nat mur has not acted? It was given Ignatia, Nat mur, all these remedies were given

532
01:19:04,890 --> 01:19:12,870
by a homeopath who knows a little bit of Homeopathy, all these grief remedies.

533
01:19:12,970 --> 01:19:20,460
No effect, on the contrary. But if you start on the right direction then the organism

534
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:30,120
starts going up, so she needs little pushes, that means low potency repeatedly

535
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:37,290
to strengthen the mental primarily, strengthen all the organism but primarily

536
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:39,970
with the stress on the mental level.

537
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:48,130
The genius here is the remedy which has a brain fag, a tiredness in the mental level

538
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:52,140
and that is Picric acid.

539
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,800
-Just one more question about Phos.

540
01:19:56,900 --> 01:20:02,650
Could you explain more in detail why you don't like the results which produced?

541
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:13,170
-Phosphorus did not do anything according to what she was saying and what I see,

542
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:19,280
all the mental confusion is left there. Maybe it's even more.

543
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:32,710
-Yes but she immediately got another remedy, I think shortly after Phos,

544
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:37,020
I don't think she was treated correctly.

545
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:47,260
-I don't think she was treated correctly. Maybe Phos is an underline remedy

546
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:52,430
which was given prematurely, that's another story.

547
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:58,680
After Picric acid, maybe Phos will develop, maybe Staphysagria will develop,

548
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:01,100
maybe Mercury will develop.

549
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:13,270
There are points for Merc, for Staph, for Phos acid, for Cocculus, for Nux Moschata, for Phos

550
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:21,170
and they maybe develop, Phos may develop as a second remedy but at this time she has not.

551
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:29,530
Otherwise, if Phos had worked, she would not appear in front of us.

552
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:36,920
-What I don't understand with Pic acid is that it says there that Pic acid has not hunger

553
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:40,120
but this woman even gets up at night to eat.

554
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:49,020
-Pic acid is not going to cure the whole case, we don't take all the symptoms

555
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:53,170
and to say because of all these symptoms we give Pic acid.

556
01:21:53,270 --> 01:22:03,360
We give Pic acid as the uppermost layer in this case which is affecting the main symptoms for her.

557
01:22:03,860 --> 01:22:11,260
Here is the main symptom and the other is lower and there are symptoms from other remedies

558
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:23,360
coming up but the remedy that will show and affect in this case, possibly is Pic acid.

559
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:33,260
Pic acid does not cover all the picture, it's not the constitutional remedy or something like that

560
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:41,760
but what I say is, low potencies like 6X of Picric acid, twice the day and then

561
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:45,440
raise the potency every week.

562
01:22:46,230 --> 01:22:56,600
Every week she goes to 7X, 8X etc. twice the day and I believe in about 2 months

563
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:06,850
she will have another picture with more strength on the mental level and then maybe

564
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:15,590
it is Nat mur the picture she will develop, maybe the picture she will develop is Sulphur,

565
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:25,780
maybe Iodum or Phosphorus. We don't know.

566
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:31,640
-Did she connect this in this way?

567
01:29:33,140 --> 01:29:37,780
-Yes, this is what I said and it was very obvious, it was very clear,

568
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:40,450
a difference started at that point.

569
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:42,880
-Do you still have the amalgams?
-No.

570
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:48,530
-What you did?
-Slowly I removed them.

571
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:49,380
-OK. Thank you.
