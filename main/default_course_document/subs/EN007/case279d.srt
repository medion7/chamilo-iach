1
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,290
-Last time what was the remedy?

2
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,000
-After Calcarea we prescribed nothing and then I got the acute.

3
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,790
-Just describe a little bit the acute.

4
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,400
-Now?
-Yes.

5
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:55,900
-I don't remember but it was I think an acute influenza that came suddenly

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,720
after being wet after perspiring. And you gave Arsenicum 200.

7
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,370
-The way you say it, it's very simple.

8
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:16,120
The way your friends were telling us it was very  dramatic, you could not move from bed,

9
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:23,300
you had high fever, you did not want to take any medicine, leave me alone, let me die etc.

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,880
-Not that much.

11
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:34,800
-Then I asked you to take Arsenicum 200, we did not see the case, you did not come here.

12
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,640
And then what happened?

13
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,980
-I fell asleep for a couple of hours, after taking the remedy

14
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,330
and it was in the middle of the day and I woke up feeling much better.

15
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:05,030
The fever felt as it had gone down a little bit and I had more energy and there was

16
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:14,380
less pain in the lungs. So I was much better after some hours.

17
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:22,130
-You actually had pain on coughing.
-Yes and the whole chest and the lungs.

18
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,550
The next morning we had to get early to the airport

19
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:37,960
and I felt pretty good and I had a refreshing sleep and normally I don't experience that.

20
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,070
That was the first time I can sit in Skiathos and don't look around

21
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,290
because all the other times I had to be the watcher of the suitcases

22
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,130
while the others were shopping.

23
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,800
-This time you went.

24
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:00,370
-Yes I felt very good, still I had a lot of clothes, still a bit aching.

25
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:12,470
Being outdoors wasn't in the beginning so good either but very fast it got much better.

26
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:25,700
There was a change when I got home because it was getting better so fast

27
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:31,200
but when I got home I had to see my parents, to pick up my cat and then I was confronted

28
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,330
with a lot of negativity for many hours.

29
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,950
-What kind of negativity?

30
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:47,610
-My mother especially was hysterical and angry because my brother had been married

31
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:56,690
for many years and his wife had just left and all this anger towards her, condemnation

32
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:04,790
she just poured out on me for 3 hours and I was sitting there. So I had a big reaction.

33
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:14,110
When I come home, I cried, I got depressed all kind of things and I suddenly felt

34
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:19,700
that all fell apart again, that all the good things that I was building up.

35
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,450
-How much lasted this disintegration?

36
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,790
-A couple of days I was able to slowly come back.

37
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:45,520
But I felt the acute and the coughing and a lot of things from the influenza stayed on longer

38
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:52,100
than it might have been without this incidence.

39
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,750
-Did you take another dose of Arsenicum?

40
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,250
-No, I was thinking but I did not.

41
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,350
-Very good.

42
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,780
-I don't know if you want all...

43
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,860
For about 5-6 weeks I had very exhausting coughing and hoarseness and stitching pain

44
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,460
in the lungs and mucus and different things, I don't know if you want all these symptoms.

45
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,550
-As you said it, it's good enough.

46
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:32,410
-Other reactions after Arsenicum. I noticed the first week I did sleep better

47
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:37,020
because that is one of the main problems for years, the sleeping.

48
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:48,100
-Tell me something. Before, that you have taken a lot of medicines have you taken Arsenicum?

49
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,050
-Yes.

50
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,390
-Continue.

51
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:03,000
-But there was some things that disturbed the sleep after one week, so then that

52
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,850
I didn't tell but it was mostly noises from outside my window.

53
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:15,850
A lot of construction work and big tracks and digging and explosions.

54
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:22,930
This is lasting even now. So when I come home ...

55
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,520
-This apartment is yours?
-No, I rent it.

56
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,000
And also other things like more frequent urination started again.

57
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,840
So I was running back and forward, back and forward, several things disturbing my sleep.

58
00:06:48,850 --> 00:07:02,490
But the first week it was good. I slept 10 hours and after about one week I had sudden diarrhea

59
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:08,660
and a lot of distention and gas and lasted for some days and that is symptoms

60
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,760
that I had for many years earlier, 15 years earlier.

61
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,010
-What was happening by that time?

62
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:29,610
-It was during period with bulimia, anorexia, I took a lot of laxatives to lose weight

63
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:44,300
but I did have no constipation, I was dancing but it's many years ago, almost 25 years ago.

64
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:55,700
-And since that time these symptoms of sudden diarrhea was left with you or it was

65
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,960
many years since you didn't have this symptom?

66
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:07,710
-I had it on and off but for 15 years I had diarrhea. 10-15 times the day.

67
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,720
-With blood some time?
-No, I don't think blood.

68
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:27,460
-So that's another thing that you now tell us, that you have been taking drugs for...

69
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:34,470
-Yes it was terrible, I don't want to remember this thing.

70
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:46,110
Another thing after Arsenicum I got very much less thirst and I wanted mostly warm drinks

71
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:52,290
but after 3 weeks the thirst started coming back and I started having bigger sips again.

72
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:05,440
-You still have this type of thirst? You need sips frequently?

73
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:10,450
-Yes but it changed a little bit again, I don't drink so much as before.

74
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:18,360
After the remedy I felt a little bit more at ease, I'm not so restless, especially

75
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,860
when I sit down to do some work.

76
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:30,690
I usually get very restless when I have to sit and that was better so I could concentrate more

77
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:37,440
and I was also a little bit better with the confusion.

78
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:51,120
My head was a little bit clearer. After about 1 week I started having lots of lacrimation.

79
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:58,020
-Sudden lacrimation or when you are in the air?

80
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,620
-Yes mostly the fresh air made it and in the evening was worse and light.

81
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:11,770
But there was a lot of symptoms from the eyes, itching and rubbing and swelling.

82
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,270
-Like you are having a hay fever or allergy?

83
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,620
-Yes.

84
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,770
-Did you have this before? You remember?

85
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:29,710
-Not so much but I think after taking Phos I had this hay fever reaction also.

86
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,620
-In the past?

87
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:44,690
-Yes 4 years ago and it was like sand in the eyes and itching and very photophobic.

88
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:52,080
And I could hardly hold them open, I wanted just to close them and don't do nothing

89
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,470
and I could hardly see, it was kind of blurred.

90
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,930
-Because of excessive lacrimation?
-Yes.

91
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,420
The whole area around the eyes was swollen, especially the upper part.

92
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,280
-In the morning when you wake up?

93
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:27,350
-Especially in the morning after sleeping long but the whole day, it's like bags.

94
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:37,500
It never has been so much before, I had a lot of this swollen thing around my eyes for many years

95
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,050
but this was...
-Too much.

96
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:51,670
-Yes and I also felt the eyelids were inflamed and hard and all the area around the eyes

97
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,920
is very sensitive to everything and that also got aggravated.

98
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:06,170
I can not take water or any cream, everything irritates and the tears get very excoriating,

99
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,020
like burning.

100
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,750
-As a child you did not have hay fever in spring?

101
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,750
-I don't think.

102
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,100
-You don't remember.
-My brother had it but I don't think so.

103
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:37,100
A little from laying on the grass and also I got more hungry for different foods.

104
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,590
-What kind of food?

105
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,600
-I wanted to have cheese and more bread and all the things that I don't really tolerate

106
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:53,650
so good and I started having butter and this gluten and more fruits

107
00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:02,980
but it started a lot of distention and cramp and pains and a lot of problems started again,

108
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:09,240
which is much better if I keep a strict diet. So I don't know if this is the remedy.

109
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:15,080
-But you continued to take bread?

110
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:25,780
-Not so much. I decided I take once in a while.

111
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,770
-You mean every second day you take one piece?

112
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:41,060
-Not so much, it was for a short while but dairy products, butter and cheese I started taking.

113
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,070
-And milk you can take?
-No.

114
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:54,660
-You take cheese and yogurt?
-Cheese and a lot of butter I desire.

115
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,410
-The most strong desire you have now is butter?

116
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:10,160
-Bread and butter and ice-cream also, mostly ice-cream. I can eat many times the day.

117
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,860
-And you take it?
-No, I try not to take it but sometimes.

118
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,060
-You are afraid to put on weight?

119
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:29,010
-No but if I start having sugar, I get this craving and restlessness and all this,

120
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:37,520
a lot of problems and sleep is getting worse. So I noticed if I'm not eating sugar,

121
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,580
I feel much more calm and peaceful and much better.

122
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,480
And also with changing this diet, I also felt a lot of old problems

123
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:02,980
with the dropping of blood sugar, sudden hunger and cold sweat and shaking of the hands

124
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,300
and I just have to eat and very much restlessness.

125
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,950
-Hypoglycemia?

126
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:16,800
-Yes, I used to have for many years very low and it did not change so much after eating.

127
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,040
A lot of problems with that, since I was a little kid.

128
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,890
-But what you did in the past?

129
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,690
-I tried different diets and I was better eating protein and I tried different things

130
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:42,800
but this was since I was a small kid and I didn't know what it was.

131
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:51,450
-But I don't remember telling us before this symptom. Now you have it again, that means

132
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,800
you had it before.

133
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:06,620
-It has been better for a while. After Arsenicum I started having some dribbling of urine

134
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:15,700
while coughing and I don't think I had it before and it lasted about 3 weeks

135
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,380
but after about 4 weeks I started to feel stronger.

136
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:29,320
More optimistic, more happy and also self-confidence was improved a little bit

137
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:38,030
because that has been a big problem and after some weeks also from many remedies

138
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:46,540
I get also perspiring and the odor of axilla get more strong, so I wash and wash...

139
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,870
-What is the odor?

140
00:16:49,970 --> 00:17:02,620
-It's difficult... maybe like garlic, sweet, I'm not quite sure and it's like

141
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,970
you can not wash it away but it's especially if I'm anxious like now, it comes.

142
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,800
I also got aggravation from neck pain, I told you about this injury of my neck

143
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,780
and several years with that terrible pain.

144
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,870
-How is this pain now?

145
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:33,610
-It's still comes and goes but it is better than in the beginning but still it's there

146
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,370
and especially after sleeping, I wake up as if it's out of place, as if something

147
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,650
has changed in the vertebrae and first thing I do is this.

148
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,740
-In the morning?

149
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,550
-Yes and also several times during the night.

150
00:17:51,550 --> 00:18:00,450
It is better but it has been acute, I had to wake up and do it many times during the night

151
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:05,450
but it is better and also a headache comes from this neck pain, I wake up

152
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:12,800
and have headache in the occiput for several hours usually especially if I sleep long.

153
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,800
And after I start walking about and moving, it starts to going away.

154
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:28,890
I also had some acids coming up that I don't think I had so much before,

155
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:36,530
sometimes if laying on the left side, sometimes if I sit down and get a pressure up here

156
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,120
but it didn't last for so long.

157
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,700
And there is also problems with dyslexia.

158
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:55,550
I don't think I have told you that either but it started actually getting worse after Calcarea,

159
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,710
progress, getting worse and worse but now I think it's getting a little better again.

160
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,850
It also brought up some pain in the sacral, lumbar area but I did have a fall in the winter

161
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:26,960
time, I fell on the ice and maybe it was this. Rheumatic pains came back.

162
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,060
-Where?

163
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:41,380
-Everywhere in the body, especially knees, legs and cold draft always makes it worse.

164
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,130
This came back.

165
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:54,730
-Joint pains. She calls them rheumatic, she has mentioned here wrists, mostly the right wrist.

166
00:19:54,830 --> 00:20:01,320
-That was something for a short while, I had this carpal, it was after a remedy.

167
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:12,830
And I also noticed when I eat butter or this gluten, I got more diarrhea and loose stool.

168
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:31,220
Also I got a strong need to create more and more order around because I have

169
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,820
a lot of chaos in my house.

170
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,390
-So to put in order but most probably you have the energy to do it also.

171
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:49,990
-Yes, I have more energy but I was not able to keep up right, not really able to keep order.

172
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,330
-It's good enough.

173
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,740
-I think I should mention a little bit about that because that is a real problem

174
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:11,730
to be organized, to structure, to make a plan, everything is a mess and I had piles with papers

175
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:18,480
and things I can not organize and I suddenly find old letters and bills that I have not seen

176
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:31,840
and I put it away. It's very difficult for me and I try to make this, a small clear.

177
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:42,250
-Very good, you have to be more organized but you felt the need to be more organized.

178
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:50,580
-Yes, I can not relax seeing all this mess around, I can not sit down reading something.

179
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,990
-So you want first to put an order and then start working.

180
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:08,240
-Yes. Also some cystitis problems came back and pain in the bladder and pressure here

181
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:15,580
in the urethra and that I also had much before.

182
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:29,910
But after a while I got a little sleep because of this noise, so I started going down again

183
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:37,490
and got irritability and bumping things and dropping things because I was so tired.

184
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:49,060
Also I had an aggravation, I told you last time I can wash and wash

185
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:57,560
and never feel clean enough, this also got even worse. I can stand half an hour in the shower

186
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:01,310
and scrub myself with this hard.

187
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:06,060
-Do you feel that you stink because of the perspiration?

188
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:12,910
-No, the feeling of not being clean enough.

189
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:24,910
 Also when I'm at home I can go and wash my hands 20-40 times the day.

190
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:36,230
-Why? For no reason or you touch something, you think it's dirty and then you wash?

191
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,070
-Yes I touch.

192
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:55,320
-When you gave us your history was any sexually transmitted disease?

193
00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:06,820
-No, I don't think so, I might have had chlamydia but I'm not sure because they

194
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:15,310
had an operation because of infertility, some years back and afterwards they told me,

195
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:19,860
I might have had it because I had a lot of ...

196
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,670
-You get what?

197
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:40,060
-Adhesions after operation? Tissues which become hard?

198
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,170
-No, they grow from one place.

199
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:50,060
-Cicatrices outside where you can see?
-No, it's inside.

200
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,920
-Adhesions all right.

201
00:24:53,110 --> 00:25:01,370
-So I might have that and I also had venereal warts but I don't think I had gonorrhea.

202
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:14,730
I also noticed that the change in the diet I was more peaceful, before I was more restless

203
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,650
and the whole nervous system gets more easily excited

204
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:30,220
and itching as everything was more sensitive.

205
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:40,600
And the clammy feet started a little bit again, not as much as before.

206
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:51,710
-And the perspiration during night?
-It was last time?

207
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,590
-I'm asking you.

208
00:25:56,590 --> 00:26:05,550
-During the acute? It can be, it comes and goes, it's not always but I can have that

209
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:13,040
a lot in the night but if I take the clothe on and covers off I start to get cold immediately,

210
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,890
so I have to have a lot of covers.

211
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,900
-Do you feel the cold more than before?
-Yes.

212
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:33,810
-Do you feel you are restless more now?
-Not really.

213
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:40,210
-Did you have any suicidal thoughts?
-No.

214
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:47,310
-Did you develop any fear or you have any fear coming back or anything?

215
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,310
-I mentioned this fear of dogs.

216
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,710
-Which is strong or you will underline it once or twice?

217
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:02,310
-It got a little bit worse, it was very strong but now I think it's going back a little bit.

218
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:15,450
-Also the stiffness you had was quite strong but you say still the stiffness is there?

219
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:27,310
The same as before or worse now?
-I'm not sure.

220
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:34,560
-When you lie in bed do you feel restlessness in your legs,

221
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:39,630
moving your legs mostly or not so much?

222
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,140
-Yes, I can be very restless in the legs, yes I can.

223
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:04,290
-Also you have said that your menses cease when you lie down.

224
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,780
-Always.

225
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,890
-This continues?
-Yes.

226
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:29,640
But I think I got more in a hurry again, the feeling of never have enough time.

227
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,980
But I had an acute, so I'm taking a remedy.

228
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:58,070
-What do you take?
-I took Eupatorium Perfoliatum.

229
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:04,860
-Because you had an acute.
-It was in the beginning of February.

230
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,700
-What kind of an acute it was?

231
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:15,620
-It was very strong influenza, very sudden and people told me this can last for weeks

232
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:25,970
and at that time I just had started a work with children in school, so I needed to get well.

233
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:35,610
-You wanted to get well immediately and you took Eupatorium perfoliatum?

234
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,710
-D200.

235
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,610
-And it helped you?

236
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:47,860
-Yes after 20 min all these pains, I had terrible aching pains in all inner organs,

237
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,790
everywhere and I couldn't sit, I had to lay down, the back was as if broken, very strong.

238
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,040
-Very strong, very sudden.

239
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:11,040
-But again one hour earlier I had been very cold on my feet and this often comes and

240
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:22,740
also I was afraid of pneumonia again but it was bronchitis with a lot of mucus

241
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,460
that I couldn't get out.

242
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,110
-Afterwards?

243
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:35,170
-No from the very beginning, it went right down. Very sudden.

244
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:40,760
-Very sudden it went down and you started coughing and the coughing how much lasted?

245
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:55,930
-I have to tell you but I was really depleted, I could not hardly stand on my legs,

246
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,260
I was really ill.

247
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:13,760
The first day I went to work, I managed because this was the first day, so I felt I had to go.

248
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,260
-What work?

249
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:24,670
-With children 6 years old in school, just an assistant to help some special kid needs

250
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:33,090
some special care and I had not been working for so many years, so I wanted this so much.

251
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:41,990
-And you managed to go after Eupatorium?
-Before I took.

252
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,080
-And then?

253
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:52,330
-No, I had to stay for a week in bed. I tried but it was impossible, I had very high fever

254
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:55,760
and usually I don't get fever.

255
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,010
-I remember the last time you had fever it was Arsenicum and you said

256
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,000
that was the first time in your life.
-Yes.

257
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:17,990
-But this time again you had a high fever. Did you call any doctor to listen to your lungs?

258
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,250
-From the very beginning, I went to work and I went to the doctor just to see

259
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:31,990
if it was a pneumonia but that was in the very beginning of the flu and he said bronchitis

260
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:36,750
at that point, with a lot of mucus and he said it was a special influenza

261
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:42,600
that really stayed for a long time.

262
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:49,080
-You did not take any other remedy except of this?

263
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:55,490
-Yes, because it stayed for a week and a lot of the symptoms did not go away,

264
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,990
the pain and all the aching went away very fast but...

265
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,740
-Then you needed another remedy, what remedy?

266
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,170
-Causticum.

267
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:12,750
-You took Causticum, that's why I see some Causticum symptoms. What happened?

268
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:31,690
-A few hours later my cough was better, it was not so hard, not so wild, more loose

269
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:40,740
and I could get out some mucus, so very fast afterwards and I had a lot of nausea

270
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:48,240
during the acute and that got also better and I had no appetite and aversion to food

271
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,340
and all the appetite came back.

272
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:58,670
I wanted very much now cheese and bread and butter, even more.

273
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:17,110
And generally I felt better after a day and more strong, so I could go to work,

274
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,400
I had to stay one more day because I reacted so strong to the draft and to the fresh air,

275
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:31,660
so I stayed one more day, to be sure but even though the cough went worse again,

276
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,910
after going outside. So after Causticum the draft has been really strong and the cough.

277
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,910
-The sensitivity to the draft and the cough became very strong.

278
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,400
-Yes.

279
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,940
-Why didn't you take Rhus tox straight away from the beginning,

280
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:57,390
because you seem to have had strong Rhus tox symptoms and the last time we repertorised here,

281
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:00,140
we saw Rhus tox was coming, you remember?

282
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,140
-No, you have mentioned Causticum but Rhus tox I can't remember.

283
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,990
-I see the repertorization here from the last time. Rhus tox was the first remedy.

284
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:20,890
-But in the beginning of this acute, Eupatorium I felt was really indicated

285
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:25,150
because the main problem was really this aching in the bones.

286
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:31,560
-Yes but the same is with Rhus tox, the main problem is aching all over. It doesn't matter.

287
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,860
It's OK.

288
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,910
-But there was a lot of other symptoms I did not tell you that go for Eupatorium.

289
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:55,300
-You were feeling cold you said, it's started with feeling cold in your feet

290
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:09,310
and then it became very painful all over the body and then you had coughing.

291
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:12,990
-Yes but I thought I had caught something from the children.

292
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:24,720
-Sure you had influenza, there is no question but I'm just wondering whether Rhus tox

293
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:37,720
might have been better than Eupatorium. But Eupatorium acted so immediately,

294
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,830
maybe it was correct.

295
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:44,900
-Between that time I could hardly think. I had no energy to repertorize, I was too sick.

296
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:49,930
-Then what happened after the second acute?

297
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:57,880
-I got and aggravation after Causticum with coughing and losing urine,

298
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:07,630
that was getting more strong and after some weeks it stopped again but Causticum

299
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:13,930
also made me more cold, more freezing and all this aggravation from the draft.

300
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,550
I think I started going outside in the fresh open air a little too early

301
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:24,070
because it came back.

302
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,060
-You wanted to go to work and not to lose the work.

303
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:34,060
-I felt so ashamed you know, it's irresponsibility.

304
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,060
-It's like the devil interferes.

305
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,400
-Normally I would not have taken anything.

306
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,730
-It's OK, no problem.

307
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,540
-But Causticum helped me a lot getting all this mucus out because it was all stuck

308
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:04,130
but for some days this bronchitis and these pains lasted.

309
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:10,030
After Causticum, after 14 days I got a new, I don't' know if it's an acute

310
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:19,270
but constant mucus from the nose and I use a lot of papers, all day and night,

311
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:33,540
it lasted for 10 days and the hoarseness got very strong again and I had difficulty talking,

312
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:43,290
I lost my voice trying to talk and the lachrymation from the eye started again.

313
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,550
A lot of sties in from the eyes.

314
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:54,290
And a lot of itching and problems around eyes and also coughing started again for a while.

315
00:38:54,790 --> 00:39:03,020
But it did not last so long, about 10 days. The hoarseness was a problem after Causticum

316
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:08,020
because at that point I was doing an audition, I was singing and I could not sing

317
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,070
for almost 2 months.

318
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:20,940
That I had a lot before, irritation from air, if I was talking loud or singing, even crying,

319
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:29,540
I had to stop crying because I started to cough so much that I almost vomit.

320
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,500
I can not cry because this irritation, so I had this a lot.

321
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:44,650
And after Causticum also a lot of these rheumatic pains came up again and especially

322
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:54,390
in the knees, the legs, the neck and the back coming back and with a little bit of draft,

323
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,960
I lose my voice.

324
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:16,350
But after some weeks after Causticum I generally felt much better and more optimistic again

325
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:29,270
and more joy and more open to people and more confident, I wanted to be more with people

326
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:38,450
and more centered in a way in myself and more energy, more strong

327
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:54,200
and all this chronic fatigue it helped a little bit but the weakness in the physical got worse.

328
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:10,930
The muscles, the legs, I can hardly walk. I used to be able to go for walks

329
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:17,360
but no other exercises because I was too weak, no energy but now I don't' even walk much.

330
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:21,270
-Here how you come? By bike?

331
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:25,610
-No, I've been trying usually with the car.

332
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:32,760
-You said you can not walk when you feel like walking?

333
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:42,510
-No, I feel more weak in the physical, just rising my arms and put some clothes up

334
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:47,870
I'm tired for nothing.

335
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:04,110
After Causticum even more stiffness, especially after sleeping.

336
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:23,600
2 months after Causticum I also had an acute with vomiting very sudden,

337
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:30,610
it started in the middle of the night and it continued the whole night and then I got diarrhea.

338
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,000
-You had eaten the previous day something...?

339
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,850
-No, I don't think so.

340
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,890
-How are you so sure?

341
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:47,360
-I usually am very careful, at that time I don't eat so much.

342
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:56,770
-No, if I eat outside I very often get this, not vomiting but diarrhea.

343
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,170
-You had not eaten outside.
-No.

344
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,930
-Did you take any medicine for that?

345
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:21,390
-No, it lasted for a couple of days but I got nauseous after that and that's about it

346
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:31,570
but things that are bothering me today is postponing things, if you can underline that 4 times.

347
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:44,140
It's a big problem, it gives me this stress and I don't know why I do it.

348
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,840
-You seem not to have enough time to do whatever you want to do and that's why

349
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:56,490
you postpone a lot of things, it's not that you are involved into many things.

350
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:07,540
-That also but I think is as if I rebel in doing and being organized, as if I have

351
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:19,030
a kind of an aversion to it and wait to the last second and I really want to change this

352
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:29,050
because it is so much problems and I think it also has to do with being with not so much energy

353
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:41,280
and I have to push myself, so adrenaline and I get this energy and I have to

354
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:45,970
and I get more energy out of that, it's like a kick.

355
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,860
With this I have to sit down and write and go home from the class and do

356
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,710
and not follow  the lesson because I postpone.

357
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:18,700
-Is anything that makes you interested to do, is anything that gives you joy in doing?

358
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,200
-Singing and dancing, I love to dance but I don't have the energy to dance so much

359
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:27,550
but I used to love it very much.

360
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:39,940
-So singing and dancing is your best thing, you look forward to doing it, correct?

361
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:48,670
-Yes and if I go home from here, the first thing I do is I put the music on

362
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:57,880
and start to sing always before I get into the house, the first thing and music,

363
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:02,450
Music in general ameliorates many, many symptoms.

364
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:09,850
-Here with this weather, which is quite warm, with this jacket you don't feel very warm?

365
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,200
-I'm pretty warm now because I'm anxious.

366
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,930
-In general?

367
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:23,980
-I'm so cold, very cold and this winter I've been thinking of moving away from Norway

368
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:32,810
I can not stand this anymore and this is not warm enough, today I've been really freezing

369
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:45,710
2 wool shocks and wool sole underneath and I was freezing and then the wind came and

370
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:51,070
then I had all this cold, the whole body and in the back and the draft.

371
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:55,710
-The draft now you feel even more than before?

372
00:46:55,810 --> 00:47:03,390
-Yes, the draft this morning was terrible for me, I got so cold and I went home

373
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:13,630
and I put the blankets and I had a lot of croissants. But maybe I should say I took this test,

374
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:31,050
the blood sample, the thyroid and this level was quite low and all people said to me

375
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:36,300
this is not normal, I'm so cold that everybody else is warm.

376
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:45,290
-How many times you had hypoglycemia?
-So many, almost all my life.

377
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:55,630
-But I mean now, the last few months, you would just have it twice or you had it 20 times?

378
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:07,220
-Maybe 10-20 times but not as bad as before, it was not like I was fainting.

379
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:13,320
Some of the times were strong and some others lighter.

380
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:36,200
I also have headache from strong odors and I also get constriction, not able to breathe

381
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,970
and I feel very terrible.

382
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:47,960
-Your thirst is less than before you would say and for cold as before or not so cold?

383
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:57,310
-More cold but before I drunk room temperature but now I drink a little bit more cold.

384
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:03,640
It's not good because my whole body gets cold, I start freezing.

385
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:13,530
-The milk you don't drink it because it affects you badly or

386
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:16,880
because you don't like the taste of it?

387
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:25,790
-I don't like it so much but I also tend to get diarrhea, I used to like it more

388
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:30,470
but I had one yogurt here but it did not taste so good.

389
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:44,950
But after Causticum I also had some anger I was able to get out

390
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:52,210
and I said "no" and that felt good.

391
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:59,030
-Did you speak at all to your mother, did you have a special discussion?

392
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,620
-A little bit.

393
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:13,300
-Did you tell her something of what you hold inside?

394
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,320
-A little bit.

395
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,650
-What does she say?

396
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:28,320
-As usually she just pulls away from me and she doesn't call, I'm just the big problem.

397
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:44,960
-But you want her approval or her consent that she has really done something wrong with you?

398
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:51,210
Do you expect that she will... or do you want it?

399
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:55,720
-Of course I want it but I start to understand I can not expect it

400
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:04,960
because she will never give me, so it's better for me not to expect

401
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:12,820
because then it just hurts me again, so I try not to expect anything.

402
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:24,250
-Later on your mother got away from this anger with your sister in law who left?

403
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:29,330
-It's a little bit better but if I talk to her, it's the same thing.

404
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:42,150
And she is so powerful this woman, it's like the whole house is vibrating with her.

405
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,690
Even is she is not there.

406
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,550
-Is she huge or she is lean like you?

407
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:53,890
-It's about my size.

408
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:09,300
-What about sweets? Only ice-cream or sweets also?

409
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:17,810
-Sweets also, a little bit more but I decided not taking no sweets, I can be able to control it

410
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:21,650
but when I taste a little bit again, it comes back.

411
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:28,550
So I had ice-cream a couple of times here and then I feel desire for sweet again

412
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:35,850
but it's not as much as before, but it's mostly ice-cream.

413
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:45,630
After Causticum my menses came 4 days earlier and that never happened before.

414
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:56,730
Usually I'm very later but also less scanty, even less scanty, hardly anything.

415
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:05,230
-Menses get scanty, not less scanty because if they are less scanty, it becomes more.

416
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:12,130
-It's been scanty always but after Causticum even less.

417
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,810
-Now it's worse.

418
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:34,720
You have said last time lying in bed in general makes you worse, you feel bad,

419
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:40,990
do you still have this idea that lying in bed is no good for you?

420
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:48,630
-It's not that I think I told, it's mostly an anxiety going to sleep

421
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:53,980
because of a kind of fear for the bad or for the night.

422
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:57,720
-This was the idea, yes.

423
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:59,970
-Maybe it's a little bit better.

424
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:13,050
-Also you had very strong problems with your memory. How is that?

425
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,840
-I have to read.

426
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:20,200
-I can see you have to read but you also have a lot of things to say also.

427
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:27,040
-Yes, I think it is improved a little bit and when I started this work

428
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:39,790
I had to face 17 new kids and I remembered all the names and that was very new

429
00:54:39,890 --> 00:54:46,980
but the teachers I still don't remember the names but with the children

430
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,300
I remember the birthday.

431
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:55,900
-Very good.

432
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:04,880
You come inside in the analysis so if we want to ask you something we can ask in the class.

433
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:14,250
-But maybe I should mention that I found out that the vitamin B12 was very low

434
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:23,920
and it was because of antibodies towards these intrinsic factors and I did not know,

435
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:31,890
so it was for many years being low. So now I have to take these injections.

436
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:39,700
-For vitamin B12 you take some injections Why don't you take vitamin?

437
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:44,230
-Because of these intrinsic factors it doesn't work with vitamins,

438
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:53,200
you have to take injections and after that I also feel my memory...

439
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,040
The day I'm going to take the injection I feel more

440
00:55:56,140 --> 00:56:01,530
clear, especially that day I have more energy, I feel I can do more.

441
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:06,870
-What about the second day?
-Yes but...

442
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:12,870
-What about diarrhea, you said sometimes diarrhea?

443
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,370
You have stool every day or you have constipation?

444
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,980
-Never constipation.

445
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,460
-And the stool is soft or formed?

446
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:28,800
-After this acute with diarrhea and vomiting, it has been very soft and often diarrhea.

447
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:48,050
And anticipation is also a problem.

448
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:53,460
-How many symptoms you have all together?

449
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,640
-29.
-29?

450
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:07,470
-But I have a couple more. After Causticum I started losing so much hair.

451
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:48,660
And cigarette smoke I can not tolerate. But I also desire tangerines and oranges.

452
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:56,810
-Lately or all your life?
-Yes, as long as I can remember.

453
00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:02,560
-You crave for oranges.
-Yes and spicy food also.

454
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:05,240
-What about fear of thunderstorms?

455
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:12,640
-I used to love it but it has gone a little less.

456
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:20,140
-What about dark? You switch off the light, you go to sleep with total darkness

457
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,990
or you want some light in the room?

458
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:31,410
-In the beginning I like some light in the room but it's no problem, I can have it.

459
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:41,980
-Do you think you have some anxiety about your brother, your mother, your relatives

460
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:47,730
do you have any anxiety about their health?

461
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:53,980
-Yes but I try not to because I feel it's too exhausting, I try not to especially

462
00:58:54,080 --> 00:59:00,900
for my mother and father but they don't listen to what I say and they keep on

463
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,780
doing their stuff.

464
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:11,000
I try to make them work less because they work and work and my father has a lot of problems.

465
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,980
-What your father is doing? What work?

466
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:31,730
-He is a mechanic in the airline and they also have a shop and he used

467
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:38,730
to have a lot of work before, day and night, he hardly slept but now I try to push it away

468
00:59:38,830 --> 00:59:41,980
because there was too much pain here.

469
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:43,320
I cannot help them, I try.

470
00:59:44,110 --> 00:59:52,570
Even when my mother talked for 3 hours and put this to me I tried to help her but it's useless.

471
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:26,280
I was asked to speak about a little bit concerning repertorization,

472
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:33,380
what kind of repertorization we can be using in cases in general.

473
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:42,390
So I have some guidelines which I was thinking I would give you or you know most probably.

474
01:00:45,410 --> 01:01:04,130
But let us say that you don't have a computer and you are using manual repertorization.

475
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:21,040
The manual repertorization basically has 2 types. One writing all the remedies

476
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:27,380
and you have in front of you all the symptoms and all the remedies.

477
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:37,780
This is almost impossible to do and therefore usually they reduce this

478
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:48,020
to some important symptoms and you look through these symptoms to see which is the remedy

479
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:52,610
which mostly goes through this.

480
01:01:53,630 --> 01:02:00,260
The other way of repertorization is the eliminating repertorization.

481
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:12,360
That means you start with one symptom and has 50 remedies, then you start with another symptom

482
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:20,430
which has 35 remedies, you start with the third symptom which has 25, 3,4 and perhaps 1

483
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:26,290
and then in the end you see which remedy comes through.

484
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:33,030
This is the way I used to repertorize also before the computers.

485
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:44,650
The problem is, in both of these repertorisations, whether you want to write all these.

486
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:53,100
This eliminating repertorization, every time you put a new symptom

487
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:58,710
less remedies come through the repertorization.

488
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:10,850
Here is 50, here is 30, 20,15, 8, 5 and here comes 3 in the end.

489
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:16,520
Between these 3 you chose one remedy. This is eliminating repertorization.

490
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:23,510
This repertorization has the problem that you are leaving out certain symptoms

491
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:26,360
that maybe are important.

492
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:35,190
This repertorization of writing everything, all the symptoms, all the remedies,

493
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:43,170
sometimes there are 250 remedies and you have a problem in looking through all the symptoms

494
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:47,630
and choosing between them the right one.

495
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:55,170
Therefore the computer has made definitely much easier this manual work.

496
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:05,910
With the manual work, the best repertorization, of course, is the eliminating repertorization

497
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:10,700
but you have to chose the correct rubrics.

498
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:20,060
If you don't chose the correct rubrics, from the very beginning you may be losing the remedy,

499
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,860
which you should give.

500
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:48,310
And now I want to, on the occasion of this case which Margaret has inserted 28 symptoms

501
01:04:48,410 --> 01:05:00,630
between 28-29, you have a problem because in the bulk of these remedies

502
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,480
you may lose actually the correct remedy.

503
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,230
What you will do? There is a solution.

504
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:20,860
After you hear all these, this and this and that you go back either by your memory

505
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:28,610
or by asking even the patient what are the really strong symptoms

506
01:05:28,710 --> 01:05:32,460
and the really bothering, strong, clear, bothering.

507
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:40,110
So you go back and you say in this case for instance, let's do the test to see

508
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:55,880
how many people will give the 5-6 symptoms out of the 28, which are really there.

509
01:05:56,630 --> 01:06:03,960
And you put them either in eliminating or you put them in just flat repertorization.

510
01:06:08,210 --> 01:06:14,210
From general symptoms, tell me one.

511
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:30,210
-Sensitivity to draft and cold.

512
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:46,210
-Worse cold and draft. Do you agree with this? Is anybody who does not agree?

513
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:58,210
So what you think is correct, that is a strong symptom. Give me another one.

514
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:03,040
-Lack of vital heat.

515
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:15,530
-This is a problem if you do it because you will insert into your repertorization

516
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:25,250
twice the same symptom. Lack of vital heat, either you take lack of vital heat or worse cold.

517
01:07:25,350 --> 01:07:35,760
If you take both because you underline 3 times or 4 times in her case, you will get Arsenicum

518
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:42,270
or Calc carbon, Rhus tox.

519
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:52,440
So you have to be careful in repertorization not to use 2 similar rubrics

520
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:55,880
which indicate the same symptom.

521
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:04,190
So you say worse cold is enough or lack of vital heat, yes you take lack of vital heat,

522
01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:08,020
either the one or the other, not both.

523
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:12,370
Never do this because you will come down to the wrong remedy.

524
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:16,700
-She has strong desire for bread and butter.

525
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:31,540
-Bread and butter. Who agrees with this desire of bread and butter,

526
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:37,200
one of the first six strongest symptoms.

527
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:38,620
-No.

528
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:47,100
-Who does not agree? They do not agree.

529
01:08:51,890 --> 01:09:03,260
-It's a very strong symptom because she eats a lot, so much, in my family we use

530
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:10,600
the packet of butter for a month and she can use it for a week, so it's very strong desire.

531
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:20,440
-This is good but if she has said it in this way, it could have been.

532
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:24,940
The way she said it it's not.

533
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:34,610
She minimized the importance of this symptom by saying it in such a way.

534
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:43,590
Never mind what you say is a strong symptom.

535
01:09:44,890 --> 01:10:04,850
-Another symptom is menses ceases on lying down. You can take that symptom.

536
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:14,100
-Music ameliorates.

537
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:26,100
-She did not say ameliorate, she said?
-Yes.

538
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:33,180
-What ameliorates?
-Her singing.

539
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:58,840
-Who says ameliorates? What? All the symptoms? She wrote it. Where is she?

540
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:09,510
-Music ameliorates a lot of my symptoms, in general I feel much better.

541
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:16,500
-Music ameliorates.
-That also yes.

542
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:28,510
-If you are so certain, I did not hear it as being so certain, you can take it, better music.

543
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:53,510
-Only two remedies, Tarentula, Aurum also it can be ameliorated by.

544
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:05,500
-She has a strong aversion to cigarette smoke.

545
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:13,510
-I didn't see it as so strong.

546
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:27,410
-Mind postponing things or not enough time to do things or short of...

547
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,540
-In a hurry.

548
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:39,340
-She mentioned that she doesn't have enough time in the day, that's why she postpones.

549
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,240
-What is the difference in the rubric?

550
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:44,240
-I think one comes from the other.

551
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:51,820
-Where you search in the rubric because she says, I'm in a hurry.

552
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:56,630
-I'm not so sure it's in a hurry because she is postponing, that's why she is in a hurry

553
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:59,970
because then she has very little time left.

554
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:08,660
-If there is a symptom, for instance, I think I'm walking on the clouds,

555
01:13:09,650 --> 01:13:14,140
it's a very nice symptom but you can not find it in the Repertory.

556
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:18,240
Now what you say can you find it in the Repertory?

557
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:26,070
-Mind postponing things.
-Yes sure, you put it.

558
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:31,270
-Postponing everything to the next day.

559
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:46,570
-Which is the remedy? Medorrhinum, Nux vomica, Platina and Silica. Postponing.

560
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:55,820
How many symptoms you have? 1,2,3,4,5 one more.

561
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:07,660
-Desire to wash.
-Washing her hands.

562
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:19,460
-Now we have 6 symptoms.

563
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:29,720
-Now what you do in repertorization, you take the most...

564
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:44,930
As you chose 6 important symptoms you start putting them in your repertorization

565
01:14:45,030 --> 01:14:53,530
whether manually... Make another case.

566
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:59,280
-I made a new case now with these 6 symptoms.

567
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:19,930
-I wanted to go more slowly, that means you put, let us, worse cold, worse draft,

568
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:35,110
menses ceases and postponing, music ameliorates wait, later on.

569
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:48,860
So you have 4 symptoms and you can make a repertorization.

570
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:58,020
Immediately you go and look what is the suggestion out of 4 strong symptoms,

571
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:06,700
it says Silica and Medorrhinum and then all the others come almost...

572
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:22,700
-Only Silica has all 4 symptoms.

573
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:32,600
-It's very interesting that Silica has all 4 symptoms. So you get an idea, then you think

574
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:37,200
back. You say, this case can it be Silica?

575
01:16:50,940 --> 01:17:02,140
Postponing, female genitalia ceases, very interesting, what you need for Silica?

576
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:18,940
To be constipated for instance. Usually Silica is constipated. She is not.

577
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:27,680
But Silica is really very cold and very much aggravated by draft.

578
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:43,910
Let's go now and add one symptom by one symptom and then you put in a hurry and

579
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:47,930
look again at your repertorization.

580
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:55,080
So if you are doing it manually, Silica will be eliminating and Silica only will be coming down.

581
01:17:55,180 --> 01:18:02,020
Already by the 4th symptom Silica will show as the only remedy going through.

582
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:09,510
Where do you feel the draft mostly, can you tell us?

583
01:18:12,010 --> 01:18:16,680
-Along the spine I think. In the bones.

584
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:17,970
-Not here?

585
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:22,840
-Also there, the upper part of the body and also the abdomen today

586
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:30,360
and in the wind I got pain in the uterus and the patella.

587
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:37,700
-Bread and butter it is true what she said?

588
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:41,440
-Yes I eat much.

589
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:45,970
-Is it true?
-Yes.

590
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:54,290
-Why don't you say it? She did?

591
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:57,380
-Not in this way.

592
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:04,370
-OK, put desire bread and butter. What symptom you wanted to say?

593
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,870
-Worse exertion.

594
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:16,020
-You said that we shouldn't give 2 similar symptoms like drafts aggravate and cold air aggravates.

595
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:26,380
-No, they are not similar, they are different symptoms. Similar is lack of vital heat,

596
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:29,600
worse cold, general.

597
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:38,790
The draft it may be not aggravated by cold but aggravated by draft, it's different.

598
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:43,770
Aggravation by draft is very strong.

599
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:50,610
Bread and butter, did you find?
-Yes.

600
01:19:56,030 --> 01:20:01,850
-I want to ask you is it a desire butter, is it a desire bread and butter

601
01:20:01,950 --> 01:20:04,010
because there is a big difference.

602
01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:09,120
-What you would say? You desire butter?

603
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:18,010
-Both but very much bread because I used to keep a strict diet and I want this

604
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:24,280
because I didn't have and I desire very much bread but I don't take it.

605
01:20:25,810 --> 01:20:30,780
But I also mentioned anticipation is a big problem.

606
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:33,280
-Anticipation.

607
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:40,530
-I've been worrying about this exam for many months and I can get diarrhea from this.

608
01:20:41,280 --> 01:21:00,770
-OK put ailments from anticipation and strong symptoms. Bread and butter put 3 times.

609
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:17,350
-I think she said that she had a strong desire for ice-cream.

610
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:26,000
-Put strong desire for ice-cream, one by one and every time you put one symptom,

611
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:34,340
show me the effect. This is real repertorization.

612
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:45,340
Whether you do it by hand or by computer you should come to the same conclusions.

613
01:21:53,420 --> 01:22:08,570
The idea of Pulsatilla is not there? Remedies? Psorinum but Medorrhinum and Silica

614
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:11,170
still are leading.

615
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:27,250
Now the next? Washing hands we put, postponing we put, OK.

616
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:36,400
You can continue putting the symptoms and every time you look, tell me the next symptom,

617
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:51,410
put stiffness on cervical region. Make it more on waking if you can find it.

618
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:58,730
Very good, put it 3 times.

619
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:06,390
-I'd like to add something because I told you I was thinking about moving to some warmer place

620
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:15,140
and lately I've been thinking that I realized that I can not live in a place

621
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:19,240
if it is not near the ocean. I have to be near the ocean.

622
01:23:22,490 --> 01:23:24,830
-Ahhh!!!

623
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:29,410
-I told you this before also.

624
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:44,660
-Put better in the ocean, she said desires oranges, put desires oranges. She said it.

625
01:23:53,920 --> 01:24:02,560
And she says really butter and she says bread also, she said it,

626
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:13,080
she expressed it now not inside. I will tell you in the end of course.

627
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:19,730
Now you do all this analysis and you do it especially in the cases

628
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:29,980
where it is not a case where you have worse from the sun, worse headache from 10-3,

629
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,830
desire salt 3 times.

630
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:42,970
Then you don't have to repertorize but in this case, you have a problem, 29 symptoms.

631
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:47,720
She gave symptom, symptom, symptom, you have a problem and that is why

632
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:56,710
I show you how you start repertorising and getting ideas about the possible remedies.

633
01:24:56,810 --> 01:25:03,960
Then you study like this and you go on and putting symptoms, more and more.

634
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:15,220
Now you go back to the previous one that you've done inside with the 28 symptoms.

635
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:30,450
When you have put a lot of symptoms Pulsatilla and Silica, Mercury is also coming

636
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:41,200
but Silica is pressing. Are you going to give Pulsatilla in this case?

637
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:43,300
-No.

638
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:52,440
-It's a bit difficult because she says, when I go out actually I feel worse

639
01:25:52,540 --> 01:26:00,200
because of the air so you don't give Pulsatilla in spite of the fact your repertorization

640
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,900
may come down to Pulsatilla, correct?

641
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:16,960
But you have in mind Silica and finally in this repertorization put amelioration from the sea.

642
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:28,880
-I think she doesn't have only mania of washing hands, she has mania of washing everything.

643
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:30,780
You can ask her.

644
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:36,030
-We can not find the washing everything, so we put washing hands.

645
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:38,380
-Washing.

646
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,130
-You have it?

647
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:52,210
-Yes, washing, desire for wash, cleanliness, mania for cleanliness.

648
01:26:52,960 --> 01:27:02,370
-Yes that's it, put this. Show me.

649
01:27:16,860 --> 01:27:18,370
It didn't change anything.

650
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:26,180
-It's the draft that has aggravated very much lately but I still have a desire for fresh air,

651
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:35,280
being outside, always. I feel my mind much clear.

652
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:53,280
-She says that she always has and had desire to be on open, so Pulsatilla, Silica.

653
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:10,040
-But draft aggravates with her.

654
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:31,510
-Yes put it 3 times and take out draft aggravates. Desires open air but still draft is better

655
01:28:31,610 --> 01:28:36,610
symptom, it's more accurate for her, correct?

656
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:49,840
Show me now the repertorization and we put another.

657
01:28:53,380 --> 01:29:02,410
You put also dancing, everything, menses scanty.

658
01:29:06,910 --> 01:29:14,660
-Another symptom, head pain from strong odors, Silica is there too.

659
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:24,950
-That's correct and this is a confirmation for Silica, put this.

660
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:45,740
Sulphur, why Sulphur jumped into the picture when she put the last symptom?

661
01:30:00,070 --> 01:30:08,570
Just put it once, this head pain from strong odors, underline it once.

662
01:30:13,070 --> 01:30:17,570
So Pulsatilla, Silica, Sulphur, Medorrhinum, Mercury, Kali Carbonicum.

663
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:35,470
-I should say she loves animals, small insects, she takes care of everything.

664
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:40,060
-Love of animals I told you, it's a natural symptom, it's not unless

665
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:46,880
you pick up all the animals all around from your neighborhood, bring them home, feed them

666
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:51,740
teach them how to stand in their two feet.

667
01:30:54,490 --> 01:31:04,370
This has to be really pathological and pathological also is to be afraid of a little dog

668
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:14,870
like this but if you are afraid of a big German shepherd, who is going not to be afraid?

669
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:16,230
Everybody.

670
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:28,630
-What seems strange to Pulsatilla, she is very cold inside she says, very cold not only chilly,

671
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:31,880
very cold she says.

672
01:31:31,980 --> 01:31:37,540
-Either you take lack of vital heat, which she suggested, or you take worse cold.

673
01:31:37,640 --> 01:31:39,890
Whatever you take is the same.

674
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:48,800
Now what I want to show is, you did your repertorization in a very nice way,

675
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:51,400
that means you tried your best.

676
01:31:53,730 --> 01:31:59,960
You went through one after another you went systematically and what has come out,

677
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:05,320
certain possibilities but no certainty.

678
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:08,060
We agree?

679
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:20,370
Then we go back to the case and we ask ourselves, if at this moment of examination

680
01:32:20,470 --> 01:32:26,780
we don't have a clear picture, we have to ask ourselves one basic question.

681
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:37,380
Is this patient doing better and how much better? What is the answer to this question?

682
01:32:38,380 --> 01:32:41,780
-Much better.
-Great.

683
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:46,030
-I don't want you to tell me she is doing better or she is doing worse

684
01:32:46,130 --> 01:32:56,250
but you have to justify your statement, she is doing better because of 1,2,3 things.

685
01:32:56,740 --> 01:32:58,250
I don't want more.

686
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:06,200
-She is doing better because she is going to work, she hasn't work for years

687
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:07,790
and she started working.

688
01:33:10,290 --> 01:33:15,630
-The number 1 amelioration is the fact that she is going to work,

689
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:21,880
I thought you spoiled my lesson, I thought somebody would not say it or say it in the end.

690
01:33:24,380 --> 01:33:32,860
When you have a case that she herself says, I have not been able to work

691
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:39,280
and for the first time I go to work, this is a tremendous amelioration.

692
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:46,020
You have jumped a level already just for that, it does not matter now she says,

693
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:52,270
I don't have the suicidal disposition, still is good that she doesn't have it

694
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:57,020
but even if she had said, I still have the suicidal thoughts,

695
01:33:57,120 --> 01:34:03,100
the fact that she is going to work, she is determined to work, she tries to keep it,

696
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:08,770
in spite of the fact she got sick, she wanted to go to work, that is a sign

697
01:34:08,870 --> 01:34:16,770
she is in her health tremendously better, that means she has jumped 1 level definitely,

698
01:34:16,870 --> 01:34:27,280
from 3 level she has been to second with strong acutes.

699
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:39,680
The symptoms become more, the physical symptoms, the organism may become upset

700
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:46,770
or it looks upset but as a whole she is doing better.

701
01:34:47,530 --> 01:34:53,170
So on the one hand we have the confirmation that the patient is doing better,

702
01:34:53,270 --> 01:34:59,000
on the other hand we have from the repertorization that the remedy is not clear,

703
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:09,010
are you going to give a remedy? No, you don't give a remedy after all this battle.

704
01:35:09,110 --> 01:35:21,680
But if the remedy was absolutely clear and nobody would doubt about that remedy,

705
01:35:21,780 --> 01:35:27,180
we would say yes in spite of the fact that she is feeling better, we can make her even better.

706
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:31,680
You just give the remedy, Medorrhinum or Pulsatilla or Silica or Sulphur

707
01:35:31,780 --> 01:35:38,670
but these remedies I can not differentiate really that she needs the Medorrhinum

708
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:44,930
or she needs the Pulsatilla or she needs the Silica or maybe the Rhus tox,

709
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:50,160
as the repertorization the last time was coming to Rhus tox

710
01:35:50,260 --> 01:36:00,270
and which I believe that during the acute the Rhus tox would have done good job in general.

711
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:08,420
-Because she did well on the last remedy, wouldn't you give her the same remedy,

712
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,520
maybe one potency higher?

713
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:23,500
-Arsenicum? No, I would not give. What I saw with great pleasure is that she says,

714
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:31,250
I never had fever in my life, that means at this moment her organism never was so good.

715
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:36,500
Perhaps only when she was 5 years old she had such good organism

716
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:40,770
as to bring out twice high fever.

717
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:50,740
So in this case of course it is very fortunate to treat the acutes with the correct remedy

718
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:56,970
and if we go back to my statement when somebody was giving...

719
01:36:57,070 --> 01:36:59,350
You gave her case last time?

720
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:06,810
-I can not remember details. I can remember she was in a terrible state

721
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:10,880
and she was just laying there and we were quite worried about her.

722
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:18,990
-You can put back the playback and you will see the dramatic way in which she gave.

723
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:26,140
You had to travel next day and you were lying down, don't want anybody, just lying down

724
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:33,380
there in an exhaustion, in high fever, you were coughing, you were in a mess

725
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:37,390
and when we took the case we asked certain questions.

726
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:43,720
The case became for those who don't remember very clear Arsenicum

727
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:52,730
and then I said now after this Arsenicum you will see the real difference in her.

728
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:55,020
You saw the difference she got a job.

729
01:37:56,280 --> 01:38:02,230
That is the difference which I meant when I said, now you will see the  difference

730
01:38:02,330 --> 01:38:13,220
and if you like we play back the case and you will see what I mean by that.

731
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:21,730
So when you have this case studied so well and at the same time you know

732
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:31,980
that she is doing so well, the first is because she got the job, because she got the acutes

733
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:40,050
and because she doesn't have the depression, for these reasons we come to the conclusion

734
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:46,640
she is doing very well and we don't touch such a case unless we are sure.

735
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:50,190
Get this inside your mind very well.

736
01:38:51,650 --> 01:38:58,300
Get it really inside, otherwise you are going to spoil your cases,

737
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:03,840
I can bring you innumerable such cases to show you.

738
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:14,720
And it's a pity because you give Silica and if Silica is not, because it's close,

739
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:19,460
Silica is going to upset the system or you give Medorrhinum.

740
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:28,710
Medorrhinum is going to be needed at a certain period of time, not at this moment definitely,

741
01:39:28,810 --> 01:39:36,390
why we should be in a hurry and we want to make her quickly well, she is well enough.

742
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:42,390
No, I'm not.

743
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:48,370
-Right in the beginning of this follow up, one could see how lively she is well

744
01:39:48,470 --> 01:39:50,210
when describing her symptoms.

745
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:54,710
Before when she was presenting her symptoms was lifeless as if she was dead.

746
01:39:54,810 --> 01:40:05,330
-Exactly. Another very strong impression is that she was going in the beginning...

747
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:07,990
now she goes...

748
01:40:08,090 --> 01:40:19,550
Before I knew where she was, she was on the next symptom, too fast, too much, too fast.

749
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:33,550
For those who remember the original case, you remember the Picric acid state?

750
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:46,300
To think is an effort, so therefore don't touch.
