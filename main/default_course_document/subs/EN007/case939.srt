1
00:00:19,782 --> 00:00:28,462
She is a 13 year-old girl with recurrent epileptic fits.

2
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:34,372
- The attacks started focalized only in the face and over the years they have developed

3
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:37,702
to full blown grand mal epileptic fits.

4
00:00:38,702 --> 00:00:53,062
She has not taken any anticonvulsive medication yet. No allopathic medication.

5
00:00:53,823 --> 00:01:01,742
The first diagnosis was a Rolandic epilepsy, in 2011,

6
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:08,142
they altered the diagnose to a primary focal and secondary generalized epilepsy.

7
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:19,423
In 2009 the attacks started with a distortion of the muscles with clenching of the jaw,

8
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:31,182
twitching of the eyelids. Clenching, she could not speak,

9
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:34,265
she could not move the lower jaw.

10
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:40,142
– This is how it started and then developed into convulsions?

11
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:44,262
– Over the years it developed more and more into convulsions.

12
00:01:44,262 --> 00:01:49,892
– Now, when she has convulsions she first starts with clenching?

13
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:58,852
– Nowadays it starts differently. When it starts today she becomes altered in her mood,

14
00:01:59,103 --> 00:02:11,144
she becomes withdrawn, she starts developing a staring gaze with enlarged pupils

15
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:18,665
and this lasts for days so that the mother knows something is coming.

16
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:25,581
– How long after that starts the convulsion?

17
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:34,266
– Sometimes there is no convulsion, sometimes it takes only a few minutes

18
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:38,622
and sometimes it takes days until the convulsion comes.

19
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:45,296
What is very prominent nowadays is that she has an abdominal aura,

20
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:49,901
she has an odd sensation in the abdomen,

21
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:54,505
wandering pains in the abdomen before the convulsion.

22
00:02:57,306 --> 00:03:01,662
The mother just said the very last attack she had,

23
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:08,826
she had very severe abdominal pains before, so severe that she had to scream

24
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:17,296
and then she had the fit which immediately eradicated the abdominal pain.

25
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:24,104
– Mention all the remedies that you have given so far.

26
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:28,216
– The first remedy was in May 2009, Ignatia.

27
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:35,109
There were problems in the marriage of the parents.

28
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:40,229
The child was sad and was sighing a lot.

29
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:48,424
The sigh went away but the localized distortions remained. She is a very sensitive child,

30
00:03:48,424 --> 00:03:57,656
sensitive to what others say about her, sensitive to rudeness, sensitive to quarrels,

31
00:03:57,902 --> 00:04:03,269
starts biting her nails and the skin around the nails. She had a desire for cold milk.

32
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:10,949
Then I give Carcinosin 1M, no effect.

33
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:16,069
In October 2009 she had the next focal fit

34
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:19,416
in addition this time the head was drawn backwards,

35
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:25,644
the pupils were dilated before and during the fits, her teeth were grinding during sleep,

36
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:31,805
so I prescribed Stramonium 200C, no effect.

37
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:39,624
In the same month she had another 2 focal fits,

38
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:42,863
she had a great desire for company, needed to be magnetized

39
00:04:43,104 --> 00:04:47,983
and cuddled wanted to sleep in the bed of her parents and had fear of thunderstorms,

40
00:04:48,224 --> 00:04:56,266
I gave Phosphorus 200. After this remedy she developed her first wart on her right hand.

41
00:04:57,048 --> 00:05:06,262
In December 2009 3 strong focal fits. She received Belladonna 200C.

42
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:13,422
In January 2010 she had the first epileptic fit where she fell.

43
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:18,299
The day before she had had an adjustment of her cervical spine.

44
00:05:18,545 --> 00:05:27,259
The day before the large attack she had an adjustment of the cervical spine

45
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:31,863
because she had had an injury of her spine in the year before in May.

46
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:36,465
She was very sad at that time, she was sighing a lot

47
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:43,383
and also was sad because her schoolmates witnessed this epileptic fit where she fell.

48
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:52,343
I gave Ignatia Q3 in a daily basis, no effect.

49
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:56,945
In February 2010 she had another seizure of falling.

50
00:05:57,045 --> 00:06:07,285
This time we could observe a chewing motion of the jaw. I gave Helleborus 200C.

51
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:14,865
After this dose I lost contact with her for the next 2 years.

52
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:27,225
For these 2 years she had received homeopathic remedies

53
00:06:27,464 --> 00:06:35,144
from someone else alternating Zincum, Cuprum, Silica…

54
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:41,302
- Alternating means in the morning this remedy, in the evening that remedy…?

55
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:50,778
– Even at the same time. Even all 3 together.
– I would like to know all the remedies.

56
00:06:50,778 --> 00:07:00,746
– Silica as Schόssler salt, Cuprum metallicum 200X, Zincum (iso)valerianicum 30X,

57
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:10,488
then again Cuprum, Zincum, Stramonium when indicated,

58
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:25,338
Bufo 6X, Ignatia XM, Arnica, Bufo 6X… that was it.

59
00:07:29,178 --> 00:07:37,104
In December 2011 the patient came because of persistent abdominal pains.

60
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:43,504
In the meantime the generalized attacks came every 3 weeks.

61
00:07:43,768 --> 00:07:49,658
During the abdominal pains she was restless, had an amelioration from warmth,

62
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:54,778
had thirst for small quantities, teeth grinding during sleep,

63
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:59,662
desire for company so I prescribed Arsenicum 200C

64
00:07:59,903 --> 00:08:05,546
with a temporary relief of the abdominal symptomatology, no effect on the seizure.

65
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:08,347
– At this moment she already has her menses?

66
00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:22,169
– No. The first menstruation was in December 2013.

67
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:28,305
– From there on is her menses normal?

68
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:33,425
– You wanted to know if in December 2011 she already had her menstruation…

69
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:39,063
- No, if she has now normal menstrual period.

70
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:45,463
– It’s not that regular yet, overall it comes approximately every 4 weeks

71
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:51,199
but the bleeding itself is not stable. Sometimes she has bleeding for 1 day then it stops,

72
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:56,730
then she has 2 more days.
– Usually has interrupted menses?

73
00:08:57,706 --> 00:09:06,412
– Up to now, yes, this was the case.
– The color of the blood changes also?

74
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:12,812
– It’s red and sometimes brown. The patient says it gets brown towards the end

75
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:18,427
but the mother remembers that in the last menstruation was brown in the beginning.

76
00:09:18,943 --> 00:09:24,063
– More or less the color is steady.
– Yes.

77
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:32,507
- Ok, continue.
– In January new cramping pains in the abdomen with nausea,

78
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:40,703
this is when this odd feeling in the abdomen began which she cannot describe very well.

79
00:09:40,972 --> 00:09:52,223
–Is it checked if there are worms in the stool? She has never been aware of such a thing? Itching in the rectum?

80
00:09:52,492 --> 00:10:03,502
– No. After this abdominal aura she develops a tension in the lower jaw

81
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:09,627
then she makes a short sound, the extremities are twitching and jerking

82
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:13,742
and from time to time the thumbs are drawn inward.

83
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:18,862
In the attack her face is first pale and then it turns bluish

84
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:23,982
after a few minutes the attack ends with a deep breath

85
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:30,623
and afterwards she is either sleepy or sometimes also confused.

86
00:10:33,183 --> 00:10:39,852
She received Cuprum 200C and 5 week later in March she had a similar attack

87
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:43,423
with the same symptoms and we gave her Cuprum Q3 daily.

88
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:52,652
In the end of March I prescribed Hydrocyanic acid Q3 daily

89
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:59,547
because of the terrible nausea before the attack. No change.

90
00:11:00,332 --> 00:11:06,384
In April she developed warts close to her fingernails.

91
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:16,378
Complained of an electric-like pain in her head, or like a lightning pain.

92
00:11:19,702 --> 00:11:27,898
– For the first time?
– Yes. Due to the periodicity and her irritability

93
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:36,586
and moles I prescribe Sepia Q3. The attacks remained unchanged,

94
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:42,488
the aggression even increased and due to this and the abdominal cramps

95
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:47,862
I prescribed Nux vomica Q3 afterwards the irritability got a bit better,

96
00:11:48,106 --> 00:12:00,662
the attacks remained unchanged. She continues to be afraid alone,

97
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:06,298
has a desire for company, wants to be magnetized, is afraid in the dark,

98
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:12,182
still grinds her teeth in sleep.
– Fear of the dark when was it developed eventually?

99
00:12:12,426 --> 00:12:17,302
– It was there before too and she had a desire for cold milk

100
00:12:17,546 --> 00:12:22,488
and the mother has asthma in her medical history

101
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,818
so child received Tuberculinum 200C and 1M.

102
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:33,226
– There is a history in the parents or grandparents of epilepsy?
– Not that we know of.

103
00:12:37,848 --> 00:12:44,248
– How old she was when she had the child?
– 21.

104
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:50,384
– Was it the first time she was having sex with the husband?

105
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:55,258
– The husband was not the first man.

106
00:12:55,504 --> 00:13:02,168
My first boyfriend separated from me when I was 18. 6 months later I developed asthma.

107
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:06,262
Later I got to know my present-day husband

108
00:13:06,506 --> 00:13:12,728
and after 3 years we were together I got pregnant and then we moved in together

109
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:18,346
in a common apartment and then I lost my asthma and then it never came back.

110
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:25,528
Either because I moved out from my mother or maybe it went on to her, I don’t know.

111
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:34,986
– But after her first contact with the first man she had any cystitis or vaginitis?

112
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:48,058
– Cystitis and vaginal mycosis I’ve had frequently until not too long ago.

113
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:54,968
– But when it started? After the first contact with the first man?

114
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:58,808
– I think only with my husband, not with my first boyfriend,

115
00:13:58,808 --> 00:14:02,138
I think it only started after I met my husband

116
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:12,106
but as a child I had frequent cystitis with pain.

117
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:15,946
And she adds; in general no abdominal problems

118
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:20,822
but her mother had severe abdominal problems all her life

119
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:24,906
and actually the doctors told her mother that she would never have children,

120
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:31,578
so the mother of the patient and her sister are miracle children, they were not expected.

121
00:14:36,182 --> 00:14:41,302
She never had a regular menstruation. Not she, her mother.

122
00:14:44,378 --> 00:14:51,288
She, herself, never had problems but her mother always had problems.

123
00:14:56,182 --> 00:15:00,784
– Sophia has a boyfriend?
– No.

124
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:11,299
– Is she interested in any boy? Before menses she has pains?

125
00:15:11,814 --> 00:15:24,342
– Stitching in the abdomen like right now. In July 2012 she received Kali bromatum

126
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:28,705
because of her aggressiveness constantly playing with hands,

127
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:35,862
fingers and cracking her knuckles and the students in her class

128
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:40,226
were shunning her more and more due to her disease.

129
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:52,143
– Inside the class has she ever had any attacks? Have you seen the attack?

130
00:15:53,946 --> 00:16:00,585
– Mother has.
– Can you describe the attack how it is now.

131
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:05,977
– Can I also demonstrate it?
– Yes. Wait.

132
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:50,666
– It starts with a frightened expression in her eyes

133
00:17:50,938 --> 00:17:55,024
and starting jerking in the face with a wide open mouth.

134
00:17:55,542 --> 00:18:01,942
– Her distortions in the face are somehow scary?

135
00:18:02,186 --> 00:18:07,062
– For me it looks as if she is scared. Wide open eyes and mouth.

136
00:18:07,302 --> 00:18:16,784
– But for one that looks at her is it very aggressive distortion?

137
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:25,226
– Not aggressive kind of distortion. The face of the child is as if she had a great fright.

138
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:39,386
– The idea is that the voice comes by inhaling? Not exhale.

139
00:18:51,945 --> 00:18:56,301
– Let me recapitulate to get it right.

140
00:19:03,706 --> 00:19:11,145
– When she demonstrated it it was very clear that the voice was coming inspiring the air.

141
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:14,985
– It’s true. When I demonstrated it, that’s what I did.

142
00:19:15,226 --> 00:19:18,061
But if I think about it, it’s an exhaling cry.

143
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:22,416
Let me say a few things she added verbally to the attack,

144
00:19:22,516 --> 00:19:28,916
when she described the fit she said for once she turns blue

145
00:19:29,306 --> 00:19:34,701
and secondly when she collapses a while she still trembles

146
00:19:34,942 --> 00:19:39,821
but then her breathing completely stops. And then she goes limp.

147
00:19:40,336 --> 00:19:46,985
And then after a while there is one deep breath and after that deep breath she goes limp,

148
00:19:47,226 --> 00:19:52,621
is unconscious in this time and only after a while the regular breathing

149
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:57,982
starts to set in on its own and then she is kind of confused, tries to get up,

150
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:03,376
moves around with her arms and the mother keeps telling her stay down

151
00:20:03,866 --> 00:20:07,981
and then afterwards she falls into a deep sleep.

152
00:20:08,222 --> 00:20:14,106
And if she cannot have this deep sleep then she would develop severe headaches.

153
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:21,786
– What does she feel during the headache?

154
00:20:22,302 --> 00:20:25,626
– When I have the headaches I actually would like to get up

155
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:31,785
but I know it is better for me if I sleep then but I don’t want to sleep.

156
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,866
At home she sleeps but if it happens in school

157
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:43,305
or if they are at the campfire she always tries to get up. It’s a great desire to get up.

158
00:20:43,821 --> 00:21:04,542
– But still she doesn’t describe her feelings during the headache…

159
00:21:08,382 --> 00:21:15,305
- The pain is on both sides of the head and if I bend forward or if I move

160
00:21:15,556 --> 00:21:19,662
or if I bump into something or if the head is jarred

161
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:25,305
it increases the pain even more than before and it feels like a great pressure.

162
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:41,702
– But the pain is stitching, throbbing, tearing…?
– She doesn’t know how to describe it,

163
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:47,583
the only thing she can say is that it is not pulsating but it is an ongoing pain.

164
00:21:49,382 --> 00:21:55,263
– Is she a good student or medium?

165
00:21:55,502 --> 00:22:03,182
– I think actually she is a good student if she studies, unfortunately she is a bit lazy

166
00:22:03,182 --> 00:22:11,652
but she is a very gifted, talented and intelligent child and she grasps things very quickly.

167
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:14,463
The doctor says this is what you believe…

168
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:25,222
Immediately after Kali bromatum she had 2 large fits on the following 2 days.

169
00:22:25,732 --> 00:22:31,103
She was contrary with her parents, she had extreme wide pupils,

170
00:22:31,342 --> 00:22:37,503
saw things coming from her closet and fear of darkness

171
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:47,225
so I gave Stramonium on the 9th July 2012, no effect.

172
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:56,185
In August 2012 I prescribed Hyoscyamus 200C

173
00:22:56,452 --> 00:23:00,543
because of her long-standing jealousy towards her 2 younger sisters

174
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:03,624
which has been there from the very beginning.

175
00:23:07,982 --> 00:23:14,136
And shortly before that she also had her first epileptic fit where she lost urine.

176
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:23,096
Before the attack she also complained of pain in her ears with alternating sides.

177
00:23:23,342 --> 00:23:27,182
In September she developed a new wart close to her fingernails.

178
00:23:28,462 --> 00:23:33,336
With the next epileptic fit she had the head drawn backwards very strongly

179
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:36,665
and complained of pain in her neck afterwards

180
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:45,102
plus she had a very strong abdominal aura with strong pain and sensations and nausea.

181
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:53,029
And she also had the staring gaze so I gave Cicuta 200C.

182
00:23:53,305 --> 00:23:59,544
After Cicuta she had very strong nausea and these odd sensations in her abdomen

183
00:23:59,811 --> 00:24:05,701
and had to stay at home for days. I think it was an entire week she could not go to school

184
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:13,381
because of that. Then she was afraid that she would have an attack again at school

185
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:22,342
with everybody witnessing it. The attack she expected came in October

186
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:32,063
and then she received Oenanthe crocata in 30C daily for one week.

187
00:24:33,582 --> 00:24:38,982
2,5 months after that she had no attacks.

188
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:44,863
In January 2013 she had 3 epileptic fits with loss of urine.

189
00:24:47,172 --> 00:24:54,062
Plus a new additional wart close to her nails, so I gave Causticum 30C.

190
00:24:55,865 --> 00:24:59,462
2 months later she was in a car accident with her grandmother,

191
00:25:00,223 --> 00:25:05,343
she had a strong shock and complained for pain on her neck, otherwise no injuries,

192
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:12,505
she received Aconite 30C once, 10 days later she had severe angina tonsillaris,

193
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:17,378
no fever which was better by warm drinks, worse after midnight

194
00:25:17,702 --> 00:25:23,609
and thirst for small quantities, Arsenicum 30C ameliorated these complains quickly,

195
00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:30,263
afterwards one dose of Causticum 30C because she had a new wart on her finger.

196
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:36,706
2 days after Causticum she had 3 epileptic fits in 2 days.

197
00:25:40,023 --> 00:25:44,130
In these 3 epileptic fits she developed a new symptom

198
00:25:44,386 --> 00:25:48,983
which was that milk aggravated her abdominal pains.

199
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,090
Before she had always liked to drink milk, now symptom;

200
00:25:53,346 --> 00:25:57,700
the abdominal pain gets worse after milk. In addition the thumbs were drawn in,

201
00:25:57,943 --> 00:26:02,502
the pupils were wide, her sleep was very deep and long after the convulsion.

202
00:26:03,012 --> 00:26:12,985
I gave Aethusa 200C. In May 2013 she had a great grief,

203
00:26:13,252 --> 00:26:18,623
there was a horse she was caring for and she was not allowed to care for it any more,

204
00:26:19,652 --> 00:26:25,785
she was withdrawn, she did not talk about her grief, had abdominal pains

205
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:32,942
and recently developed herpes labialis, so I prescribed Natrum muriaticum 30C.

206
00:26:34,502 --> 00:26:39,582
In the middle of the month she had 3 grand mal fits one after the other

207
00:26:43,422 --> 00:26:52,905
and I prescribed Natrum muriaticum 1M. In June, another attack in the same way.

208
00:26:59,056 --> 00:27:03,661
In this month she developed a new symptom, which was strong desire for eggs,

209
00:27:03,902 --> 00:27:08,265
fried eggs and soft and had strong perspiration

210
00:27:08,781 --> 00:27:14,906
and so I prescribed Calcarea carbonica 30C daily. In June she had another grief

211
00:27:15,181 --> 00:27:22,345
because a girlfriend rejected her, just stopped all contact, ignored her completely.

212
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:27,981
She had another attack with a very long phase of not breathing

213
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:33,342
which scared the mother greatly and I gave her Ignatia XM.

214
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:40,506
The Ignatia did not bring about any change concerning the kind of attacks

215
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:45,705
or the frequency but then the mother told me of an incident that had happened

216
00:27:46,222 --> 00:27:54,425
which was invaluable. At this time the mother told me about an incident

217
00:27:54,692 --> 00:28:01,582
which had happened in 2008. At the time that was before the attacks started.

218
00:28:02,372 --> 00:28:06,212
At that time the child came running after her mother, saying

219
00:28:06,212 --> 00:28:10,542
“Mommy the boys locked us into basement and we couldn’t get out”

220
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:18,745
and she had a great scared expression on her face and she was talking very fast

221
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:20,014
and the mother tried to calm her down and said, well, come on, slow down

222
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:27,425
and tell me about it and stay here. She didn’t let herself calm down

223
00:28:27,694 --> 00:28:30,744
because she wanted to go right back down and play.

224
00:28:31,024 --> 00:28:34,343
She didn’t want to stay with the mother and so the mother thought,

225
00:28:34,584 --> 00:28:38,424
well it can’t have been that bad if she wants to go back down again.

226
00:28:38,704 --> 00:28:46,904
But after this, a few days later her voice dropped, the tone of her voice became lower,

227
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:52,543
that was noticeable. It was very odd.

228
00:28:52,782 --> 00:29:00,223
– Was there a second fright perhaps? She noticed her parents fighting?

229
00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:03,545
– Well, there was a situation between my husband

230
00:29:03,812 --> 00:29:14,783
and me which might have scared her but that was already in autumn of 2006,

231
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:17,712
maybe, 2 years before she had the attacks.

232
00:29:17,866 --> 00:29:28,146
But 1 year before attacks started lots of things happened in our family.

233
00:29:38,023 --> 00:29:44,423
Her parents are divorced. The wife second wife of her father died of cancer,

234
00:29:44,944 --> 00:29:51,590
in the same month I gave birth to my 3rd child, which is her sister.

235
00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:01,090
And in the very same month the brother of my father had an accident

236
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:05,943
which made him fall into coma, he died 6 months later.

237
00:30:07,941 --> 00:30:12,542
– Ask the child directly if she remembers all these. She does not remember.

238
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:20,022
How old was she?
– She had just turned 7.

239
00:30:20,545 --> 00:30:23,619
– But she does not remember all these.

240
00:30:24,134 --> 00:30:29,505
– Well I can vaguely remember that this happened but I have no idea how I felt.

241
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:34,102
– Does she remember she was locked down by the boys?

242
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:39,284
– A little bit but I don’t know who it was.

243
00:30:41,944 --> 00:30:50,386
– If the mother can describe her reactions, what would she say?

244
00:30:50,650 --> 00:31:07,544
How she reacts in the ordinary life? Is she very calm, very angry, very anxious…?

245
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:12,146
– On the one side if something really affects her or hurts her feeling

246
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:16,504
she withdraws into her room and does not talk.

247
00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:25,975
– The first reaction is withdraw.
– That’s the one side.

248
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:32,703
On the other hand she really knows what she wants and if there is something she wants

249
00:31:32,972 --> 00:31:38,346
and she cannot get it, she can become very clear, demanding, even aggressive

250
00:31:38,587 --> 00:31:48,703
and wants with all her mind to get it. And she manages to get it,

251
00:31:49,226 --> 00:31:55,372
even if she doesn’t get it from me. She gets it from the neighbor or somebody.

252
00:31:55,626 --> 00:32:04,586
– Is she eating fruits?
– I only like certain fruit.

253
00:32:05,866 --> 00:32:16,102
– Does she like unripe fruits or ripe fruits?
– Sweet. Ripe and soft.

254
00:32:16,343 --> 00:32:19,183
– How does she sleep? Which position?

255
00:32:19,424 --> 00:32:25,583
– Often on my left shoulder, sometimes on my right shoulder, I hardly ever lay straight.

256
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:29,143
When I wake up in the morning it’s mostly on my back.

257
00:32:32,224 --> 00:32:37,344
– If she takes a bath in the sea, how does she feel? She likes the bath?

258
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:44,262
– I like it but I prefer a sand beach because sometimes I am still afraid of the fish

259
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:55,533
and I don’t really like the stones that much. The pebble beaches.

260
00:32:55,782 --> 00:33:01,664
But the mother says she is in the water all the time.

261
00:33:02,104 --> 00:33:08,250
– She is not afraid she might have a fit during swimming?

262
00:33:08,504 --> 00:33:14,135
– If I have the sensation there might be one coming, I don’t go into the water.

263
00:33:15,415 --> 00:33:28,984
– Ok, then you gave Opium 200C and repeated Opium and then Pulsatilla…

264
00:33:29,223 --> 00:33:33,586
- Because of strong headaches which were ameliorated from cold applications.

265
00:33:34,343 --> 00:33:38,706
She was crying from pain. Pulsatilla helped very quickly.

266
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:46,135
Afterwards she developed a new wart. One week later she presented with gastroenteritis,

267
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:51,506
strong aggravation from everything that was fat. I repeated Pulsatilla.

268
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:59,429
- Is her stool normal or is diarrheic? Soft or hard?

269
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:04,399
– It’s not too hard and not too soft and I asked whether it is formed

270
00:34:04,665 --> 00:34:16,703
and it is soft and formed.
– Wart in index finger, you gave Thuja.

271
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:27,330
– In the end of December 2013 she had her first menstruation.

272
00:34:27,825 --> 00:34:45,250
– And she was actually 12 years old. A difficult case.

273
00:34:46,938 --> 00:35:05,368
– The pressure is increasing also from the side of the school authorities.

274
00:35:27,904 --> 00:35:56,099
That’s an easy case again. All the good remedies have been given. There is nothing left.

275
00:35:59,939 --> 00:36:11,459
What shall we do. Is the mother a student?

276
00:36:11,974 --> 00:36:19,906
No. Is there anybody who wants to ask a further question I did not ask?

277
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:24,770
She wants to ask. Ok.

278
00:36:30,893 --> 00:36:50,093
- I would like to ask if the girl is going in her room alone early in the evening

279
00:36:53,143 --> 00:37:04,422
and stays alone there. Probably masturbating.
– Once she is in grief.

280
00:37:04,663 --> 00:37:09,293
– Probably masturbating, this is the question.

281
00:37:20,023 --> 00:37:27,462
– Whether Bufo has been given. Has everybody understood what she asks?

282
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:35,902
Yes, everyone except of me. Very good.

283
00:37:36,666 --> 00:37:48,702
She was asking for the remedy Bufo and she is correct. She looks like Bufo, right?

284
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:54,345
But the girl is quite clever actually;

285
00:37:54,586 --> 00:38:00,745
I did not except that she would give answers of that type.

286
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:10,221
She is not the Bufo type though she looks like. That look is different.

287
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:18,142
I can explain to you why she has this but it’s not proper for me to do that.

288
00:38:25,581 --> 00:38:41,705
– About her character; is she dictatorial? I mean why have some of her friends left her?

289
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:53,982
Is it like she wants to dominate?
– You want to give her Lycopodium?

290
00:38:53,982 --> 00:39:00,141
- No, I just want to know for what reason they have left her

291
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:05,776
because she is very strong and her mother says if she wants something she will take it.

292
00:39:06,782 --> 00:39:21,901
And why her friends want to leave her?
– If she is dictatorial what would you give?

293
00:39:22,142 --> 00:39:27,021
– I just put in my analysis dictatorial…

294
00:39:27,262 --> 00:39:37,776
- Put it and tell me. If you put dictatorial what is the remedy?

295
00:39:42,622 --> 00:40:00,026
– There are many of course…
- Lycopodium. I saw it.

296
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:12,827
– Generally she is a quite sweet and shy type of girl.

297
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:18,986
Only before she is getting to have a fit she is getting to be more demanding

298
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:26,183
but I wouldn’t say dictatorial and concerning the friendships that are sort of dissolving,

299
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:33,546
this is girl is 11, 12, 13 years old and she is having fits

300
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:44,822
and the other girls are pointing with the finger to her, saying “look! She is having fits!”

301
00:40:46,102 --> 00:40:47,898
This looks horrible.

302
00:40:52,248 --> 00:40:57,862
– That’s correct. She is in a very difficult situation

303
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:04,023
because they have not given any antiepileptic drug so far,

304
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:11,703
therefore during school time she was having fits and everybody was looking,

305
00:41:11,942 --> 00:41:20,409
so it’s a very difficult situation emotionally and the girl is quite sensitive

306
00:41:20,663 --> 00:41:23,462
because you see, when she is insulted,

307
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:31,419
when she is in grief she withdraws, she goes inside.

308
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:44,983
That’s why they gave several times Ignatia but it is very interesting in the analysis,

309
00:41:45,745 --> 00:41:54,969
I will tell you a few things. Very interesting points in her case,

310
00:41:56,742 --> 00:42:00,859
very interesting points to understand what has happened.

311
00:42:06,225 --> 00:42:16,219
So this class will end up having more silence than talking.

312
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:29,265
These cases are so difficult, we have to put together.

313
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:41,819
– I found very remarkable that the mother was telling about this incident in the basement.

314
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:48,983
At that time the girl was 8 years old, she can’t remember.

315
00:42:49,222 --> 00:42:52,823
I think this is really remarkable

316
00:42:53,062 --> 00:42:57,179
and I really wonder what really happened down in that basement

317
00:42:57,179 --> 00:43:03,579
because shortly after this incident the focal fits started.

318
00:43:06,903 --> 00:43:13,049
What really happened in the basement and what did this incident do to the body

319
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:17,143
and especially to her nervous system.

320
00:43:19,822 --> 00:43:28,536
– Your observation is correct, I was also was wondering why she cannot remember.

321
00:43:29,029 --> 00:43:33,146
She has pushed it into the subconscious, something was taking place there

322
00:43:33,385 --> 00:43:37,990
and most probably, everybody knows what was taking place

323
00:43:38,266 --> 00:43:47,226
but nobody will speak about it. What do I mean?

324
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:51,066
You agree but if I ask you, you have to know what happened.

325
00:43:51,305 --> 00:43:54,906
– I would be interested in the following question.

326
00:43:55,145 --> 00:44:02,310
Hahnemann says stronger illness pushes away weaker illness

327
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:16,143
but she is developing warts, gastroenteritis and angina.

328
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:29,190
Is this a try of the organism to get rid of this illness

329
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:36,623
or is it just that they accidentally come in addition?

330
00:44:37,385 --> 00:44:46,617
– Definitely the manifestation of warts is an effort of the organism

331
00:44:46,863 --> 00:44:54,297
but this is not enough because it’s not pushed by the right remedy.

332
00:44:55,305 --> 00:45:02,223
All these remedies have been given according to the symptoms

333
00:45:02,746 --> 00:45:11,183
and are good prescriptions but still they are the wrong prescriptions.

334
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:16,303
They did not bring about a curative action,

335
00:45:16,826 --> 00:45:27,577
the organism is still trying to get rid of the problem but cannot,

336
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:39,590
so we’ll see what really happens in the afternoon.

337
00:45:43,183 --> 00:45:53,670
One more question. My voice has not stopped.

338
00:45:54,185 --> 00:46:17,743
– The father was really seemed having affairs.
– Does she know? The woman told you?

339
00:46:18,051 --> 00:46:25,221
It’s not something you know. She already knows.

340
00:46:26,744 --> 00:46:33,906
– In 2009 they had a crisis in the marriage and they were close to divorce.

341
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:45,182
And at that time her husband was studying in Vienna and was having several girlfriends.

342
00:46:45,426 --> 00:46:53,624
– He was having several at the same time, together…

343
00:46:56,946 --> 00:47:08,984
- Well at least not only his wife, to put it this way.

344
00:47:10,264 --> 00:47:24,101
– That is quite possible that the father had gonorrhea,

345
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:29,221
because they married she starts having vaginitis,

346
00:47:29,464 --> 00:47:35,102
she starts having leucorrhea, she has itching.

347
00:47:35,864 --> 00:47:43,026
He has given her an infection of a gonorrheal type.

348
00:47:44,581 --> 00:47:50,981
There is no question about that but also this confirms,

349
00:47:51,224 --> 00:48:01,464
because a man who has so much sexual desire has to run, he runs there,

350
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:11,704
that means one time he will get it definitely. Because at a certain moment,

351
00:48:11,971 --> 00:48:23,770
when there is no real partner, he will go to a prostitute or to find easy sex and then,

352
00:48:24,263 --> 00:48:31,943
that is the time they get it. So he was having gonorrhea

353
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:39,384
and gave to her before their marriage and then she was born

354
00:48:40,146 --> 00:49:06,262
and then we will give Medorrhinum. Who agrees with Medorrhinum? Only 2, 3, 4, 5, 6…

355
00:49:07,022 --> 00:49:25,705
Not enough votes for Medorrhinum. This is a very interesting case for me

356
00:49:25,977 --> 00:49:32,870
because it is a big challenge. I will explain why.

357
00:49:40,826 --> 00:49:47,737
From what you perceive from my talking to you now

358
00:49:47,737 --> 00:50:02,063
do you think I know the solution of this case or I don’t? Who says I know?

359
00:50:04,105 --> 00:50:12,303
From my talking you understand I know. I think I know. That’s different.

360
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:18,283
That is true. But we will see the effect.

361
00:50:28,262 --> 00:50:38,253
I want to make a statement in the beginning.

362
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:51,303
As you have seen the case was going from bad to worse,

363
00:50:53,345 --> 00:51:04,344
within 4-5 years progressed to the point that…

364
00:51:04,624 --> 00:51:18,704
what scared me a little bit was the fact that the mother said lately she had an attack

365
00:51:19,214 --> 00:51:33,784
which was not coming back and this epileptic fit scared the mother. Do you remember?

366
00:51:34,064 --> 00:51:52,622
Did I understand it well or not? It will appear that perhaps the homeopathic remedies

367
00:51:52,898 --> 00:52:10,818
were actually pushing the disease deeper and deeper. Correct? Correct. This is not so.

368
00:52:15,938 --> 00:52:26,422
The actual and the usual progress of an epileptic person is exactly that;

369
00:52:26,422 --> 00:52:34,862
if you let it without medicine epilepsy has the characteristic

370
00:52:35,382 --> 00:52:43,330
of becoming worse and worse year after year. This is the normal.

371
00:52:43,582 --> 00:52:49,345
What you do not see perhaps is that they don’t have fits

372
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:53,006
because they get antiepileptic drugs,

373
00:52:53,147 --> 00:53:04,492
but if it is left alone like in this case the normal progress of an epilepsy case is like that.

374
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:16,507
So they start with one grand mal in 6 months, then it comes in 3 months,

375
00:53:16,782 --> 00:53:28,812
then a month and then once a week and then several times a day.

376
00:53:34,702 --> 00:53:40,063
I would accept the remedies were not correct.

377
00:53:41,866 --> 00:53:47,743
But that does not mean, as many of you thought,

378
00:53:48,012 --> 00:53:54,666
that the homeopathic remedy pushed the disease deeper and deeper.

379
00:53:54,666 --> 00:54:12,943
Simply did not do anything if not helped in certain cases. It might have been worse.

380
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:26,777
I was told that by Mr. Hahnemann this afternoon.

381
00:54:30,618 --> 00:54:39,106
He says tell them that because they will think that my method is suppressing.

382
00:54:39,106 --> 00:54:46,263
I told him ok I will have this in mind, I will tell them. So my mission is accomplished.

383
00:54:46,786 --> 00:54:51,650
Now we go to the actual facts.

384
00:54:53,425 --> 00:55:01,623
The remedies that were prescribed were quite to the point.

385
00:55:01,623 --> 00:55:15,185
That means the one who prescribed except of the mixtures, he had some good idea of the Materia Medica.

386
00:55:15,185 --> 00:55:28,503
If we go to the causative factor, what caused the beginning of the problem.

387
00:55:31,054 --> 00:55:41,025
If there was a hereditary predisposition you could say mother,

388
00:55:41,294 --> 00:55:48,464
father or grandparents had epilepsy so she had a predisposition.

389
00:55:48,705 --> 00:55:54,094
She did not seem to have a predisposition.

390
00:55:54,094 --> 00:56:21,506
She seemed to have a weak nervous system that was very much disturbed by several factors, I believe.

391
00:56:23,025 --> 00:56:33,540
What are these factors? The fact that the girl got such a fright on the first

392
00:56:33,783 --> 00:56:43,227
when she went back to her mother trembling in a terrified condition, something happened to her,

393
00:56:43,502 --> 00:56:52,187
nobody know she cannot remember, therefore the trauma must have been quite deep.

394
00:56:52,462 --> 00:57:02,943
Because children will bury the trauma, they don’t like to remember.

395
00:57:04,987 --> 00:57:21,902
This was the first shock and most probably there was a further shock in the family

396
00:57:22,002 --> 00:57:34,943
where there must have been some conflicts between man and woman and most probably the child

397
00:57:35,043 --> 00:57:43,246
felt she is going to lose the parents. That’s another fright.

398
00:57:43,387 --> 00:57:51,342
So ailments from fright is one symptom that you can use.

399
00:57:58,252 --> 00:58:13,657
You will say why you thought this way and why we cannot think the same way as you.

400
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:45,306
I will ask you this; what was the most peculiar symptom for her that strikes you. She has raised her hand.

401
00:58:50,426 --> 00:59:12,986
– For me it was that it starts with a terrible pain in the abdomen and also bending backwards

402
00:59:12,986 --> 00:59:21,177
which point to one remedy.
– What she says is correct.

403
00:59:21,423 --> 00:59:31,706
The most peculiar thing that was coming again and again it was a connection between the abdominal upset,

404
00:59:31,973 --> 00:59:51,938
pain as a precursor of the attack. For one moment during the prescription this symptom started going away

405
00:59:52,186 --> 01:00:07,298
but fortunately it came back that was the key to the solving of the case. Why was it the key to the solving of the case?

406
01:00:07,546 --> 01:00:32,384
I will show you now. If you go to that symptom that Ilana had pointed what you would have seen… show them.

407
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:58,986
The aura of an epileptic fit comes from the abdomen and it says Indigo.

408
01:00:59,227 --> 01:01:10,747
As soon as you see this remedy you should immediately go to the Materia Medica to see what this Indigo is doing.

409
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:20,258
– But there is another rubric; abdomen, epilepsy, begins in and there is only Bufo here.

410
01:01:20,258 --> 01:01:40,982
– Stupid! Put this. Wait. Abdomen… your Bufo is coming back.

411
01:01:40,982 --> 01:02:00,623
She was thinking of Bufo. Abdomen, epilepsy, begins. Also mydriasis

412
01:02:00,864 --> 01:02:10,093
– Epilepsy before. Eye, pupils, mydriasis, before are also 2 remedies Argentum nitricum and Bufo.

413
01:02:11,373 --> 01:02:42,582
– Also the excitement from the fright.
– That’s correct. Show that. And has given Bufo. Who prescribed Bufo?

414
01:02:42,826 --> 01:02:58,063
–It was 2 years ago.
- It was a mixture. Very low potency.

415
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:16,745
Now, go to the Materia Medica, this is the process;

416
01:03:16,745 --> 01:03:31,590
you notice this, you go to the Materia Medica. We show the Materia Medica of Indigo. Materia Medica;

417
01:03:31,866 --> 01:03:45,946
marked action on the nervous system and of undoubted benefit in the treatment of epilepsy with great sadness.

418
01:03:46,185 --> 01:04:08,710
Excited mood and desire to be busy. Neurasthenia and hysteria. Blue color. Stricture of esophagus.

419
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:15,625
Vertigo with nausea. She mentioned nausea again and again.

420
01:04:15,897 --> 01:04:23,577
Convulsions. Sensation of a band around the forehead.

421
01:04:23,823 --> 01:04:34,586
I was trying to see because there is a peculiar symptom where the person feels that may have water in the head,

422
01:04:34,825 --> 01:04:42,266
so I was asking to see whether she would give me, I didn’t want to ask a direct question but she could not say.

423
01:04:42,505 --> 01:04:55,938
She said that she felt her head frozen. Ears; Pressure and roaring. Excessive sneezing and epistaxis.

424
01:04:56,186 --> 01:05:07,302
She had epistaxis? No. Metallic taste. Eructations. Bloating. Anorexia. Rectum; Falling of rectum.

425
01:05:07,543 --> 01:05:11,142
Aroused at night with horrible itching at anus.

426
01:05:11,383 --> 01:05:25,984
Constant desire to urinate. Urine turbid. Catarrh of bladder. Hysterical symptoms where pain predominates.

427
01:05:26,253 --> 01:05:35,703
Excessive nervous irritation. Epilepsy; flashes of heat from abdomen to head; fit begins with dizziness.

428
01:05:35,803 --> 01:05:46,833
Aura from a painful spot between shoulders. Aggravation during rest and sitting and this remedy is better,

429
01:05:46,982 --> 01:05:53,903
she has the feeling that if they get up and move they will feel better.

430
01:05:54,144 --> 01:06:01,094
So at a certain moment she said when I have the headache my inclination is to get up.

431
01:06:01,859 --> 01:06:09,025
But then logically I say it is better to stay here but I want to get up and move.

432
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:35,623
So we don’t have enough information about that remedy… Let’s go back to Bufo. Show me Bufo.

433
01:06:50,225 --> 01:06:55,063
Acts on the nervous system and skin. Uterine symptoms marked. Lymphangitis of septic origin.

434
01:06:55,163 --> 01:07:03,665
Arouses the lowest passions. Causes a desire for intoxicating drink, and produces impotence.

435
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:11,345
Of use in feeble-minded children. Prematurely senile. Epileptic symptoms.

436
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:20,305
Convulsive seizures occur during sleep at night. More or less connected with derangements of the sexual sphere,

437
01:07:21,346 --> 01:07:29,784
seem to come within the range of this remedy. Injuries to fingers; pain runs in streaks up the arms.

438
01:07:30,051 --> 01:07:36,946
Anxious about health. Sad, restless. Propensity to bite.

439
01:07:38,226 --> 01:07:58,664
Howling; impatient; nervous; imbecile. I try to find out about her sexuality. It’s a very sensitive issue.

440
01:07:58,764 --> 01:08:08,765
The mother was there, the girl is 13. Are you masturbating, I could not ask these things.

441
01:08:08,865 --> 01:08:19,516
So I wanted to get information and in an indirect way. So what did I ask; are you interested in boys?

442
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:32,132
Do you have a boyfriend? No. Are you interested in any boy? Yes.

443
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:49,785
That means in her fantasy, she fantasizes something. I don’t know what she fantasizes and I could not go any further.

444
01:08:50,052 --> 01:08:56,185
But then if you remember I asked what class she was and if she is good at school.

445
01:08:56,703 --> 01:09:11,545
For this reason; to differentiate. To see her mental condition. She said she is a medium student.

446
01:09:11,812 --> 01:09:21,023
And then the mother started saying something and I whispered almost what she was going to say,

447
01:09:21,262 --> 01:09:29,132
she was going to say that she is not studying properly so if you listen to the video carefully you will see me telling

448
01:09:29,386 --> 01:09:40,906
before the mother what the mother was going to say because I saw the IQ of the girl was not for Bufo state.

449
01:09:42,186 --> 01:09:56,012
She is a hysterical girl. You see the make-up of the girl; it’s a hysterical girl who wants to get whatever she wants…

450
01:10:00,622 --> 01:10:16,537
But she is not… You see Bufo… She has some thicker lips and keeps the mouth open but Bufo

451
01:10:16,783 --> 01:10:44,425
brings the tongue out much more obviously. The real state of Bufo is one of constant pleasure of the lowest type.

452
01:10:44,943 --> 01:10:57,743
Do you know that there are pleasure of higher order and then middle order and low order?

453
01:10:58,266 --> 01:11:07,983
So Bufo is on a constant pleasure on the lower side.

454
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:21,306
Seeing the symptoms we say he seeks solitude to practice masturbation.

455
01:11:21,545 --> 01:11:33,826
He seeks solitude he wants to be by himself and enjoy. But that pleasure is all the time.

456
01:11:33,926 --> 01:11:55,463
That means the hormones are in such condition that they arouse the lowest feelings and sensations of the human.

457
01:12:02,622 --> 01:12:25,742
So, she did not give me this idea. Also the fact that Bufo was given before and brought about no change

458
01:12:27,022 --> 01:12:37,262
though I investigated I was not happy with the prescription.

459
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:47,502
Therefore the description of Indigo is much more fitting

460
01:12:48,025 --> 01:13:00,825
her personality, a hysterical girl with fears, with tendency to get frightened,

461
01:13:01,064 --> 01:13:09,785
frightened she may lose her parents, because the boys did whatever they did to her etc.

462
01:13:10,296 --> 01:13:26,936
This shows an excitable person, nervously, which is afraid, which has a tendency to get a fright quite easily.

463
01:13:29,224 --> 01:13:41,102
Therefore the description, what I saw in Indigo, fits more than Bufo.

464
01:13:46,862 --> 01:13:57,892
Now you may say Indigo is going to cure the child?

465
01:13:58,143 --> 01:14:16,302
No. But it is going to reduce the epileptic fits quite substantially

466
01:14:18,623 --> 01:14:35,184
and most probably the next remedy that will be needed will be… Medorrhinum.

467
01:14:35,694 --> 01:14:39,534
The next remedy that she will need will be Medorrhinum,

468
01:14:39,783 --> 01:14:45,934
but when I investigated whether Medorrhinum is at this moment indicated,

469
01:14:46,034 --> 01:14:53,863
I did not see any of the keynotes of Medorrhinum. Therefore it’s not the time to give Medorrhinum now.

470
01:14:54,104 --> 01:15:12,304
Though it is an epileptic condition which is primarily guided by the fact that she has a sycotic miasm,

471
01:15:12,545 --> 01:15:25,863
how do we know that? By the warts. The warts which come out show that there is a sycotic miasm,

472
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:34,574
that means infection from gonorrhea in the past, either the parents, or the person herself,

473
01:15:34,823 --> 01:15:50,704
or even the grandparents can pass the predisposition to the children.

474
01:15:57,104 --> 01:16:32,665
Therefore I would think Indigo will affect the case. Now which is the potency? This is a big question.

475
01:16:32,865 --> 01:16:53,506
What is happening in an epileptic fit? Here is an inflammation of a certain area in the brain.

476
01:16:53,745 --> 01:17:05,024
There is an inflammation and the inflammation every year becomes bigger and bigger

477
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:14,262
and the inflammation comes from time to time, it’s not all the time there.

478
01:17:14,506 --> 01:17:31,146
But at this moment it has covered a big area of the brain because the fit remains quite strong and quite long.

479
01:17:31,928 --> 01:17:46,346
The mother says, I was afraid she would not come back. So, we have an inflammation but it is quite deep in the brain,

480
01:17:48,652 --> 01:18:03,227
we have some indications about a remedy… which potency?

481
01:18:13,226 --> 01:18:55,703
Who will give 10M? 50M? CM? 1M? 200C? 30C? Majority. 12C?

482
01:18:59,823 --> 01:19:19,533
I try to gather some more points for 12 you see. Somebody else maybe? 12X? 12C? Was it the first question?

483
01:19:19,782 --> 01:19:36,173
The centesimal. 12X is the decimal. 1 over 10 is much lower. Well, 12X is my decision if not even lower,

484
01:19:36,943 --> 01:20:03,543
repeated 3 times a day, every day for 1 month and the next month 13X, and the other month 14X for 2 -3 months,

485
01:20:04,064 --> 01:20:20,739
in which time I believe it will start showing a reduction of the intensity and the frequency.

486
01:20:24,579 --> 01:20:37,622
This is a very teaching case, in case the remedy acts. Why do I say that. Can anybody tell me?

487
01:20:37,722 --> 01:20:41,863
You are homeopaths, you are looking on a case,

488
01:20:42,135 --> 01:20:52,690
you have discovered a new remedy you never thought about and you have some points and you give it.

489
01:20:52,790 --> 01:21:14,264
What is the benefit?
– I am thinking not only the benefit of the case

490
01:21:14,775 --> 01:21:23,986
but our benefit to discover more symptoms for Indigo. If some proving symptoms will appear.

491
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:38,066
– But more specifically?
– She is not under allopathic drugs.

492
01:21:38,823 --> 01:21:52,146
– She is pure it is a benefit.
But the real benefit that you would never imagine in your life to see

493
01:21:52,410 --> 01:22:01,370
it was the performance of the mother who imitated the attack.

494
01:22:02,135 --> 01:22:09,815
When you see it again you may happen to be in front of an epileptic fit and what you have seen,

495
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:24,903
stayed in your memory, will never go away. Because an epileptic fit has so many different types.

496
01:22:28,250 --> 01:22:46,701
And you saw the imitation of the mother. This is something very interesting from her description.

497
01:22:46,942 --> 01:23:08,461
I said did you inspire? She was inspiring making the noise? When she performed it was like taking a deep breath.

498
01:23:08,702 --> 01:23:23,546
When the case was finishing, how did it finish? Like a deep breath again.

499
01:23:24,062 --> 01:23:35,341
An epileptic fit starts with a deep breathing and ends in deep breathing.

500
01:23:35,582 --> 01:23:48,382
If Indigo cures the case, then it becomes keynote for the remedy. See how you study the remedy.

501
01:23:48,656 --> 01:23:57,865
What more? How much you learn. You have learned certain things in the medical schools.

502
01:23:58,381 --> 01:24:09,901
All are mechanical things. Useful but mechanical. So what else you learn from this case?

503
01:24:10,416 --> 01:24:22,942
It is very interesting that her problem is connected to lack of oxygen.

504
01:24:23,465 --> 01:24:38,576
The brain is at a certain moment depleted of oxygen. Why do I say that?

505
01:24:49,065 --> 01:25:04,941
– During the epileptic fit she has cyanotic lips and this is an expression that has a deficit of oxygen

506
01:25:05,182 --> 01:25:21,065
and this is disturbing the brain. Damage is progressing with each epileptic fit.
 – So what we learn further?

507
01:25:21,581 --> 01:25:37,705
That Indigo affects the nerve which gives movement to the lungs, which is the vagus nerve.

508
01:25:37,946 --> 01:25:49,466
Which is cramped. And the moment it is cramped, in a hysterical person,

509
01:25:49,982 --> 01:26:00,222
you can understand the inner structure of the organism. What happens; there is a kind of a stricture,

510
01:26:00,496 --> 01:26:16,105
a kind of a cramp on the vagus nerve and the lungs stop producing, giving out oxygen to the brain.

511
01:26:16,862 --> 01:26:37,616
Then the brain says I am in danger and then either has to faint, fall down, or in this case, because there is a problem,

512
01:26:38,622 --> 01:26:53,741
the person becomes unconscious. Why in fainting you become unconscious? Because you don’t have enough oxygen,

513
01:26:53,982 --> 01:27:03,423
you faint unconscious so you don’t need so much, the brain can survive without the normal amount of oxygen.

514
01:27:03,662 --> 01:27:09,062
Do you see how the pathology is connected according to my understanding?

515
01:27:09,305 --> 01:27:22,416
This is how I understand and how I observe. I spoke last week in London.

516
01:27:22,665 --> 01:27:40,546
They had a meeting in which all the famous homeopaths of today were going there to show solidarity.

517
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:48,502
So they asked me George please come to London, I said I cannot come to London and it’s very good

518
01:27:48,742 --> 01:27:52,342
because most of them were my students.

519
01:27:52,582 --> 01:28:03,862
I said it’s good for you that I will not be there so you can be free to express your crazy ideas.

520
01:28:04,102 --> 01:28:23,062
Because if I am there you will feel a bit shy, timid. They pressed me to come, I said ok, what I will do,

521
01:28:23,302 --> 01:28:35,586
I will send one of my lectures and after the lecture I will answer questions for half an hour.

522
01:28:37,252 --> 01:28:47,225
They showed the lecture and then opened skype so I spoke to them.

523
01:28:47,506 --> 01:28:56,745
I told them you must know that I love you very much because most of you are my students but

524
01:28:57,261 --> 01:29:10,061
also you must know I do not agree with the crazy things you are doing. So now you put questions.

525
01:29:10,576 --> 01:29:19,856
They put some questions which were not important. But some clever guy who was there,

526
01:29:20,346 --> 01:29:30,221
said can you tell us how did you make your Materia Medica?

527
01:29:30,462 --> 01:29:39,945
He thought if he told us the way then we can also make our Materia Medica.

528
01:29:40,702 --> 01:29:51,706
So I told them what I just showed you in practice. This is how I made Materia Medica.

529
01:29:52,222 --> 01:30:01,456
But now if I see a second case and has similar symptoms and I prescribe Indigo and is doing well,

530
01:30:01,946 --> 01:30:07,582
then immediately the picture of Indigo becomes alive.

531
01:30:08,105 --> 01:30:17,065
And this was the idea originally because people were saying we hear all symptoms,

532
01:30:18,861 --> 01:30:24,222
we don’t hear something concrete and complete and alive.

533
01:30:24,496 --> 01:30:32,425
So when I gave the Materia Medica everybody was excited because I have done these observations.

534
01:30:37,545 --> 01:30:45,225
I don’t know if I have prescribed because they are thousands of cases but as far as I remember

535
01:30:45,466 --> 01:30:56,496
I do not remember an epileptic case in which I prescribed Indigo. But this case now it is like a first case for me.

536
01:30:56,986 --> 01:31:13,627
So I put this in my memory and I will have it as a model. If I see it again, repeat it, acts, the third time I am sure,

537
01:31:13,902 --> 01:31:24,652
this is a case of Indigo. This is how I made Materia Medica. I gave you all the secrets.

538
01:31:25,422 --> 01:31:41,292
So you do not have any excuse for not doing the same. Hyoscyamus is the first one.

539
01:31:49,983 --> 01:32:06,426
You changed the symptomatology. Some more symptoms of Bufo. As far as I know the Bufo epilepsy,

540
01:32:06,937 --> 01:32:19,252
it’s an epileptic fit which comes usually in connection with sleep, it comes during sleep,

541
01:32:19,503 --> 01:32:36,143
it is quite convulsive, not what she showed me,

542
01:32:36,418 --> 01:32:44,346
this trembling convulsion and after that deep sleep follows for quite sometime.

543
01:32:44,864 --> 01:32:58,222
– I feel that you are not 100% satisfied with Indigo. Can I make another suggestion for another remedy?

544
01:32:58,745 --> 01:33:06,425
– Yes, I would be very happy to hear it.
– I found some arguments for Artemisia.

545
01:33:06,692 --> 01:33:11,022
– I have never prescribed Artemisia but...
- In the books it’s a good remedy…

546
01:33:12,825 --> 01:33:30,222
So you want to see whether Artemisia has any of the symptoms. Can you find for me Artemisia?

547
01:33:30,385 --> 01:33:40,625
Convulsions from fright, ailments from fright, eyes staring, bladder, urination, unvoluntary, convulsions,

548
01:33:41,143 --> 01:33:50,103
during, face, lockjaw, extremities clenching, thumbs.

549
01:33:54,143 --> 01:34:12,827
Not bad but still no effect because it does not take the main symptom which is

550
01:34:13,612 --> 01:34:26,412
the abdominal aura from which starts the epileptic fit. That is going on again and again.

551
01:34:26,907 --> 01:34:37,932
– But I have the symptom with Artemisia, it’s under stomach, I will look for it.

552
01:34:38,186 --> 01:34:50,732
Stomach, convulsions, spasm, epileptic aura. There is Artemisia.

553
01:34:50,986 --> 01:35:01,467
- It’s not in aura. It is an aura which starts from abdomen.
– But abdomen and stomach are not so far away.

554
01:35:01,983 --> 01:35:18,382
– It is interesting also in Indigo that in the
pathology, in the Materia Medica, it says epileptic fits

555
01:35:18,623 --> 01:36:03,423
from worms which is definitely an idea that the abdomen is involved…
- Epileptic fits from anger; Indigo…

556
01:36:06,747 --> 01:36:19,052
- But the guiding symptom which brought us to the idea of Indigo was the connection between

557
01:36:19,306 --> 01:36:31,067
the abdominal aura and the epileptic fits. That was all along the description.

558
01:36:31,342 --> 01:36:43,103
After a certain time in the development of the case the abdomen was involved.

559
01:36:43,372 --> 01:36:51,052
Pain preceded the epileptic fit. Somebody wants to talk.

560
01:36:51,306 --> 01:37:04,864
– For me it was also striking that during all these
epileptic fits this symptom persisted. It was related to

561
01:37:05,382 --> 01:37:18,703
abdomen. So what she said is that at the end of this
story she describes a feeling which wanders up and down,

562
01:37:19,213 --> 01:37:35,343
sometimes more, sometimes less. Abdominal aura. So we have this kind of rubric; generalities; convulsions;

563
01:37:35,584 --> 01:37:47,863
epileptic aura abdomen to head which, so Indigo is the only remedy that has this symptom.
– That is the idea.

564
01:37:48,143 --> 01:37:59,663
The whole prescription is based on that particular strange, rare and peculiar symptom.

565
01:37:59,904 --> 01:38:10,455
Only one remedy has this. That’s why I feel quite certain that the remedy is correct.

566
01:38:10,706 --> 01:38:18,542
– Something more; without knowing anything about Indigo I just went as you said in Materia Medica and

567
01:38:18,822 --> 01:38:30,585
then there is said these epileptic fits with great sadness. So it’s related to Ignatia,

568
01:38:31,103 --> 01:38:35,972
there is the sadness and the cramps, it’s said they are even.
– Exactly.

569
01:38:36,462 --> 01:38:52,345
And you remember the girl as soon as she felt a grief, it was deeply, inwardly sad.

570
01:38:52,612 --> 01:38:59,502
– What I want to say is that Vithoulkas compass is excellent.

571
01:38:59,782 --> 01:39:08,462
Without knowing a remedy you just put the striking symptoms and it will…
- Bring it up.

572
01:39:09,503 --> 01:39:18,212
Compass is programmed according to my way of thinking of course.

573
01:39:18,702 --> 01:39:33,573
That’s why with 2-3 symptoms the remedy comes up and shows it and you have to investigate. Says be careful.

574
01:39:35,343 --> 01:39:49,698
– George, I would like to know how you estimate the chances of healing for this girl and

575
01:39:49,946 --> 01:39:59,938
on which level of health you consider her to be.
– The level must be around 7-8.

576
01:40:00,186 --> 01:40:23,493
If the remedy is correct there are chances of healing. Because later on we may have the possibility to give Ignatia

577
01:40:23,744 --> 01:40:37,824
for her grief and we have the possibility also to give Medorrhinum because of her predisposition with sycotic miasm.

578
01:40:39,618 --> 01:40:55,493
Ignatia was given frequently but did not act. Because in the uppermost layer there is another remedy.

579
01:40:55,983 --> 01:41:03,424
Unless you give the uppermost layer remedy forget it.

580
01:41:03,663 --> 01:41:15,706
The grief is there but upon it there is another layer and this is Indigo.

581
01:41:15,973 --> 01:41:33,893
Unless you give it forget the cure. For 5 years he is struggling. Last question.

582
01:41:36,453 --> 01:41:43,343
She is not sure she wants to ask a question but she will ask.

583
01:41:48,224 --> 01:42:12,026
– I always of the girl in the basement what happened there and afterwards it started not much later and maybe

584
01:42:12,544 --> 01:42:21,253
there was something of a sexual misuse…
- Maybe.

585
01:42:21,504 --> 01:42:33,384
– But maybe all these things in her abdomen, we think they are strange but I think this...

586
01:42:33,900 --> 01:42:47,705
- This is going a little bit too far… Epileptic fits from fright…

587
01:42:50,786 --> 01:43:03,855
- It started with convulsions only in the face.
– She got a fright, that is enough for us.

588
01:43:05,625 --> 01:43:13,305
And then started convulsions. Which are the main remedies for convulsions from fright?

589
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:17,566
– Calcarea carbonica, Hyoscyamus, Ignatia, Indigo and Opium.

590
01:43:17,666 --> 01:43:35,625
The main remedies. Therefore this fright supports the idea of Indigo.
