1
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:31,440
I want to give you a case and the follow up of the case, so I can show you a point which I

2
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:37,940
have said in my teachings frequently.

3
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:49,450
This is a woman 50 years old and she is suffering with varicose veins and some kind of

4
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:58,690
disturbance, a kind of colitis.

5
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:08,370
She says that she has pain in the right leg on the calf and behind the knee and

6
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:13,130
in the knee as well and in the knee also. So there is some pain in the calf,

7
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:24,960
pain in the knee and she cannot flex it.

8
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:43,380
She has varicose veins in both legs and these are worse standing and with stitching pains.

9
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:50,300
The pain in the knee is better walking.

10
00:01:50,400 --> 00:02:04,800
She takes Brufen 400 ml; this anti-inflammatory drug that she takes, makes very little

11
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:14,890
difference.

12
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:40,620
She is wearing this orthopedic kind of shocks for the phlebitis, for the varicose veins and

13
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:50,850
because her work is mostly standing, she is working on a coffee shop...

14
00:02:50,950 --> 00:03:02,240
She has bloatedness in the abdomen in the evening hours, the bloatedness is underlined

15
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:16,140
twice and worse after exertion.

16
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:35,870
She takes Tavor and she is generally worse after exertion. Exertion makes her much

17
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:42,120
worse, underlined twice.

18
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,130
She has anxiety in her work because she has to deal with a lot of people and she has

19
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:56,120
anxiety about her children and she is impatient.

20
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:14,870
She has right hemicrania, right type of headaches and mostly on the right temple.

21
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:26,630
Together with the headaches she has a inner trembling, loses her color and she feels very

22
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:36,960
much weak and she has to lie down at least two hours.

23
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:55,460
She takes [drug name] it is a major painkiller with caffeine inside and

24
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:14,240
after she's recovered from the headache, she remains in a state of exhaustion for many hours.

25
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:29,640
Constipated, sometimes she has to take laxative, small laxative, it's not a big constipation.

26
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:36,380
The blood pressure comes up to 170 and she takes this tranquillizer and brings the

27
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:43,800
pressure down.

28
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:50,970
Do you have any idea about the remedy? Do you have any indication what is the remedy

29
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,560
and for what reason?

30
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:03,720
I give you the symptoms. It is a person suffering from arthritis of the knee, from phlebitis,

31
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:22,970
from varicose veins and headaches, she is worse definitely with exertion.

32
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:37,050
Calcarea is the right thing to think under this symptomatology, wakes up refreshed most of

33
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,960
the time...

34
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:54,880
If she has high blood pressure, she noticed that she has burning in the eyes.

35
00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:08,130
She had all the children diseases, she had tonsillectomy at the age of 20, she has an

36
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:15,050

37
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:22,800
She never suffers with any allergy or any skin eruption.

38
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:35,550
The father died from brain stroke and the mother died from brain stroke.

39
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:47,100
She perspires only during summer.

40
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,180
She says in order to drink water, she wants it a little bit sweet the water, therefore she

41
00:07:52,280 --> 00:08:09,680
adds some orange, sweet  juice orange and she has a big thirst and drinks quite a lot.

42
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:21,600
She has a lot of urination, copious urination, immediately after drinking water.

43
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:41,680
She said I never cry in front of people, I go and hide myself to cry, sighing, she has a

44
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:55,930
flabby stomach and abdomen and she is wearing a kind of girdle.

45
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:12,010
Nails are good, she says she is a closed person, not underlined, she is rather optimistic,

46
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:23,770
easily offended, underlined once and she says she is worse in Autumn time, generally she

47
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,100
feels very much the cold.

48
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:37,350
Generally worse cold, underlined two times but the feet are always in good condition,

49
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:48,850
rather warm and in spring time she had to take them out but not in the winter.

50
00:09:48,950 --> 00:10:01,360
She used to have a lot of cramps in the night, generally better in summer time and better

51
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:18,850
with the sun and better with Tavor, this anti-anxiety remedy.

52
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:30,610
She is easily disgusted but not underlined.

53
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:47,100
Desires, she has an aversion to fat only and she has a desire for milk, underlined twice,

54
00:10:47,200 --> 00:11:01,940
fruits, underlined twice, she eats a lot of fruits, she does not like sweets at all unless it is

55
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:12,270
homemade.

56
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:25,350
And she has a desire for soft boiled eggs, underlined three times.

57
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:33,360
That's interesting for the follow up, I know it's not interesting the case for you.

58
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:41,440
Who knows the remedy?

59
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:54,690
The obvious remedy is the correct remedy here, don't be afraid.

60
00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:01,440
Because I'm bringing all difficult cases here and you say it can't be so easy.

61
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:12,690
It is Calcarea carbonica. So Calcarea carbonica 1M was given to this woman and she

62
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:26,180
never came back for the follow up. She only came back five months later when she used

63
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:40,410
an expression with 'your medicine I flied'. There is an expression, if you feel very well,

64
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:52,240
you say 'I fly' meaning I was very well. She used this typical expression to show how well

65
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,820
she felt.

66
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:04,330
It stopped the anxiety she says, no anxiety, I was flying and I was absolutely well, no

67
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:23,830
distention, no dysphoria, everything was perfect, no drug and she took only one medicine.

68
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:37,320
She said that there was a great grief in her house. She does not rely actually what has

69
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:45,580
happened but she says that she was except of the grieves, which is one part, she does not

70
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:56,070
say what was the grief, she also had a quarrel with her husband and further problems with

71
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,980
her children, she does not relate what it is.

72
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:18,860
So she says I have again sighing, I can not take enough air inside me, it's very difficult to

73
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:31,620
breathe and I had to take tranquilizers again.

74
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:51,870
There are some stitching pains in the sole of the feet, I feel psychologically tired and I'm

75
00:14:51,970 --> 00:15:20,000
irritable and I can not take up anything. I forget easily and I had too many things to do, she

76
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:38,600
didn't have the headaches also but now she says again I have anxiety.

77
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:46,590
So there is anxiety, there is psychological tiredness, she is not feeling well and she has

78
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:53,340
this syndrome of not being able to breathe.

79
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:03,420
In that case I would like to tell me what you will do?

80
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:09,590
You have a Calcarea carbonica which acted beautifully. It took away the pains from the

81
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:19,950
legs, the varicose veins and she had a grief and she comes back with that syndrome, the

82
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:28,020
anxiety, the irritability, the tiredness and the difficult respiration.

83
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,280
She was doing perfectly well but she says I had a great grief and I had a quarrel with my

84
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,890
husband and I had problems with my children and all this together brought about that

85
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,610
stage which she describes.

86
00:16:44,710 --> 00:17:06,170
My question is what do we do? We have several possibilities. First question, is this a relapse?

87
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,420


88
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:15,980
It is not a relapse, it's a partial relapse.

89
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:24,730
What is that now colors the case? What is the patient she said I had that grief and then I

90
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:33,390
sigh, I can not take a big breath, I can not still be satisfied with the breath.

91
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:42,650
That is... she says that when she came for the first time?

92
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,150
-No.

93
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:54,480
-So we have a Calcarea case which did very well and then that person who is quite

94
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:04,260
healthy now but take on grief, she does not say what kind of grief.

95
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:21,080
She develops symptoms of either Calcarea phosphorica or what?

96
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:28,500
In a Calcarea carbonica case when it is done worse, when there is a relapse with anxiety

97
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:41,750
and difficult respiration, this sighing what you would prefer to repeat Calcarea, to give

98
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:53,500
Ignatia or to give Calcarea phosphorica and for what reason?

99
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,510
But I have to prescribe.

100
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,340
Who will be in favor of repeating Calcarea carbonica and for what reason?

101
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,600
Is anybody wants to speak up?

102
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:14,090
We don't have a description of the anxiety in the first place, the anxiety here is described

103
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:20,410
as a general state. What we had before is characteristic of Calcarea carbonica, it was the

104
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:32,670
aggravation from exertion, it was the phlebitis and the getting cramps and then worse cold

105
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:38,250
and then desire for soft boiled eggs.

106
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:47,250
They were the symptoms on which we prescribed Calcarea carbonica on the first case.

107
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:53,000
We do not know whether to start with anxiety which she has now, it is a different type of

108
00:19:53,100 --> 00:20:03,170
lesser or not even intensity, we don't have that information. If we had prescribed on a

109
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:12,870
particular kind of anxiety on the first place and she had the same anxiety the second time

110
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:23,000
exactly, we can base a prescription, a repetition of Calcarea carbonica.

111
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:34,250
But here we have a case where it has done very well and then she has from that person

112
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:40,250
who may need a second remedy, Calcarea has done whatever it could, at least for the

113
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,510
time being.

114
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:49,250
It's not so easy for a Calcarea to come back, if you give a Calcarea or a Sulphur or a deep

115
00:20:49,350 --> 00:21:02,750
action remedy and takes away a layer, it's not so easy to see the same layer coming back,

116
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:08,000
unless it is really some big stress.

117
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:16,500
What I have told you that there is many times an imprint of the remedy upon the person.

118
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:27,440
Due to certain stresses the remedy a picture of a remedy is imprinted upon the person.

119
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:43,170
It is the same way that we give Arnica, the idea is not that everybody needs Arnica.

120
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:55,500
It is a sudden shock of the tissues of the body that brings about a state, which is the state

121
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,250
of Arnica. That is why when you give Arnica to 100 people, it will act to 20 people, to the

122
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:11,660
rest 80 will not act because this 30% people may need Berberis, Rhus tox, Bryonia, they

123
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,120
need other remedies to cover the state which was brought about after shock and you give

124
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:23,170
Arnica and it does not work. Then you have to go to Rhus tox or Bryonia and it acts

125
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,340
beautifully.

126
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:33,830
So there is an imprint, we can have our organism which is imprinted upon a remedy and

127
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:43,830
this is my reason why I agreed with Ignatia and I have prescribed Ignatia.

128
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:51,590
Because Ignatia is a grief remedy, that person got a grief and got a symptom which is

129
00:22:51,690 --> 00:23:06,910
characteristic of Ignatia. After a grief, a strong keynote of Ignatia.

130
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:21,420
If that person had tell you, I have anxiety, tiredness, pains in the sole again but she did not

131
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:37,000
mention at all this difficulty in respiration, until she has told me that I feel extremely tired

132
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:49,090
now, very tired and I take a lot of fruits, my mind would go to what remedy?

133
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,110
-Phosphoric acid.

134
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:57,610
-Phosphoric acid because this is the information and you have to base your prescription.

135
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:09,920
It changes the remedy, if she would tell me that she is anxious, tired and pains in the sole

136
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:24,120
but not sighing but this tiredness is accentuated to the grief after sleep, wake up from an

137
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:33,880
afternoon nap that she takes and she says I'm absolutely rotten, then...

138
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:43,120
Open your remedy generalities, sleep, aggravation afternoon sleep and tell me what is the

139
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:51,620
remedy? Everybody will see the remedy.

140
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:59,870
A grief remedy that says tired, does not have the sighing, after sleep...

141
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:22,800
Which is the remedy?

142
00:25:34,640 --> 00:26:11,370
Grief remedies, ailments after grief, grief after an aggravation...

143
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:19,120
But the way that the patient said that symptom, accentuates that symptom so much and

144
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:26,120
she gives it to you then you would go to remedies which have it very strong.

145
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,620
Which is the remedy that has it very strong?

146
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,240
-Staphysagria.

147
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,160
-Staphysagria because the person gave it very strong in the same way that that person

148
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:41,160
gave strongly the sighing, I can not sigh because it is a peculiar symptom of Ignatia.

149
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:47,660
It covers the case and leads towards Ignatia. In the same way if it was said afternoon

150
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:58,510
sleep I'm rotten, I can not wake up which is a strong symptom of a remedy which has

151
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:04,870
grief and worse afternoon sleep. This is Staphysagria.

152
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:12,820
I had a case which was Calcarea and now she has gone to Calcarea phosphorica because

153
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:18,830
of the difficulty on the respiration, because that is all the symptom you have.

154
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:36,330
This tiredness is a general symptom, anxiety is a general symptom, too many remedies.

155
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:46,740
How many times in your life you have given Calcarea phosphorica after grief?

156
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:57,850
Very few times. That which is frequent...

157
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:23,080
For me it is very obvious, I don't know if it is for you, but for me it's very obvious.

158
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:34,080
Because if we have upper remedy, we have the development of another keynote, this

159
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:43,830
keynote will be the leading symptom for our prescription. If that keynote is of the same

160
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:54,080
remedy like before, I will give Calcarea carbonica but if that keynote is a keynote of

161
00:28:54,180 --> 00:29:00,160
another remedy, which are the remedies that have that strong? Calcarea phosphorica and

162
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:06,500
Ignatia, either I would give Ignatia or Calcarea phosphorica.

163
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,580
Why do I go to Ignatia? Because first of all the state she presents to me is not anymore an

164
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:19,830
arthritic condition, that it has been taken care, it is not varicose veins, it is just the grief of

165
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,310
something that has happened to her life.

166
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:29,230
Grief brought about some kind of anxiety again of course,

167
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:35,310
with a strong keynote of a remedy which is more superficial than Calcarea phosphorica.

168
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:46,550
I would not go and give such a deep remedy for what I consider to be a minor symptomatology and

169
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:54,220
 I do not have enough symptoms for Calcarea phosphorica to justify, giving such a deep remedy.

170
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:09,810
Now if she had said instead of...  but she has developed now a great pain in the cervical

171
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:20,540
region, which again is a characteristic of Calcarea phoshorica, then I will have no more

172
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,510
point to prescribe for Calcarea phosphorica and I would have seen that something is

173
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:33,260
going on in this area of the vertebrae and that is on the realm of the Calc. phosphorica

174
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:41,090
pathology but we don't see anything of that. We see grief and sighing, which is the first

175
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,840
remedy for grief?

176
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:53,760
You don't go and give deep remedies for that reason before we try the most obvious.

177
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:58,610
So the most obvious is Ignatia and we try...
