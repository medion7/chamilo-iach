1
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:31,030
-It's 11 months old boy, it's born 20th of October 96, he was one week late,

2
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:39,440
and the umbilical cord was around his neck and the delivery was

3
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,460
-Speak slower and more clear.

4
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:59,960
-His weight was 3.620 gr, his height 53 cm, the anamnesis of 5th of January 97 was

5
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:07,210
the following. Parents removing from one flat to another but it was a neighbor flat and

6
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:17,800
the mother was very nervous, everybody was very nervous and there was a lot of fuss

7
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:29,610
going on. He had milk crusts on his head with bad smell and around the size of a palm.

8
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,370
-How old he was by that time?

9
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,030
-Half a year.

10
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,190
-And how this went away?

11
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:50,040
-He received Sulphur 1M and after that it went away almost, to a little small like a coin.

12
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,480
-You have treated the child so far?

13
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,690
-I gave him Sulphur but after that he received Calcium.

14
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,140
-Calcarea carbonica?

15
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:09,410
-Cal. carb. 20th of August this year, 200 Calcarea.

16
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,650
-And Sulphur?

17
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,400
-1M, 5th January 97.

18
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:24,150
-When did the child develop the neurodermatitis?

19
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:34,410
-It was middle of June, end of June. In the beginning of the year he was very restless

20
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,910
his hands and arms were always moving and he was showing with his arms to the air

21
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:46,900
just like this.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,410
-Before Sulphur?

23
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:57,600
-Before Sulphur. When being in the baby carrier, he was calmed down, also when we

24
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:04,180
were driving, the vibration did him good, he falls asleep in a couple of minutes when

25
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,390
he had been softly vibrated.

26
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:13,140
Also when he was hearing soft music or all kind of music, he likes it, now he is even

27
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,400
clapping his hands when hearing the music.

28
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:26,140
When he was being dressed up for walk and gets warm, he starts crying very much.

29
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,650
-Crying, not scratching?

30
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:37,650
-No. Why he is crying? When he is dressed up?

31
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:44,400
-It was winter and if he is getting dressed up, in January and he was very soon too warm

32
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,160
then he started crying.

33
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,650
-And if you take out his clothes, then he calms down?

34
00:03:52,750 --> 00:04:04,160
-Yes. He was sweating easily, he has smelly perspiration in his hairy scalp and around

35
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:13,580
the nose, there are always little drops around his nose.

36
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,990
-Only the nose?

37
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,960
-Scalp and the nose.

38
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,660
He was a little too late when he was born and he had already the finger nails and he

39
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:32,410
was scratching his face very much, immediately after birth, which is considered to be

40
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:39,660
relatively normal.

41
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,160
He sleeps 7 hours at night, best on his belly.

42
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,910
-This report when it's written?

43
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,160
-In January.

44
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,150
-Before you gave Sulphur?

45
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:58,910
-Yes. Afternoon sleep is very bad because of restlessness, he likes warm bathing

46
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:06,580
with his father, 38 degrees, he doesn't like to be alone in the bath.

47
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,580
-38 degrees in the bath but he cries when he is dressed?

48
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,340
-Yes.

49
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,340
He wants to feel his parents, specifically his mother close, otherwise he screams.

50
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,100
This was in January. We tried to let him sleep without breast feeding during sleep or

51
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:37,590
in the beginning of the sleep but he wouldn't accept it. He would scream.

52
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,850
-He was immediately feeding before go to sleep.

53
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:49,680
-Yes he would fall asleep during breast feeding.

54
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,900
He likes very much to go out and play, mainly with other children, still now.

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,660
After receiving Sulphur his mood was 95% better, his sleep was much more calm and

56
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,660
he slept now from 7 until midnight without waking and he would wake at midnight

57
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,820
he takes a breast and then after he sleeps again.

58
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:22,080
Then there was a vaccination from 24th of January to 20th of March, he received

59
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:31,890
hepatitis B, TB, diphtheria, haemophilus influenza all intramuscular in the right thigh and

60
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,260
the first and last state combined with polio.

61
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,530
Everything together.

62
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,270
-All this is compulsory for Germany?

63
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,050
-No.

64
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:52,100
-But until that time there was no trace of neurodermatitis?

65
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:58,600
-No, nothing.

66
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:06,680
-Some of them at least they need a repetition. When it was the repetition?

67
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,680
-Of the vaccination?

68
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,420
-Yes.

69
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,910
-It was 3 times, these 3 months from 24th of January, 20th of February and 20th of March.

70
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:20,330
-So the last vaccination was 20th of March. After that he was not vaccinated.

71
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,250
-No.

72
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,500
-And the first signs of neuro-dermatitis when?

73
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,450
-3 months later.

74
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:37,660
-What happened after vaccination? Did he have a reaction in vaccination?

75
00:07:37,760 --> 00:08:03,670
-No. No fever, no restlessness, nothing. No problems. He continued to sleep well.

76
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,170
-He has some problem with his breathing?

77
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:27,410
-No.

78
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:36,050
it was first diagnosis of fungus infection antimycotic drugs didn't work on it.

79
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:43,310
On the 10th of July there was the diagnosis as neuro-dermatitis. He was very red

80
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:52,070
and it was now in both legs, very red and rough, he had small spots in the cubital fold

81
00:08:52,170 --> 00:09:06,160
he had behind the ear, he was sweating, he still has some behind the ear

82
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,320
-What is this? First time he does like this?

83
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:26,990
-No, he does that very often. That is his way of expressing himself.

84
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,750
-It was on the knee folds.

85
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,940
-Is he a boy or a girl?

86
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,660
-Boy.

87
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:42,660
-Spreading first down and then upper leg, it was a time when he was beginning

88
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:49,100
to crawl on the floor, so it was maybe because of this.

89
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:58,460
On the hands, the back of the thumb the first finger was very red as well.

90
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:07,500
The whole back was red, face, cheeks and under chin, he received therapy with  (?)

91
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:21,920
which contains Dulcamara and he wasn't reacting to drops of Dulcamara.

92
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,420
-Only, nothing else?

93
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,170
-Nothing else. Dulcamara mother tincture?

94
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,170
-I think so.

95
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,090
-Not potentized?

96
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,460
-No.

97
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,320
-And the mother why she was taking this?

98
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:46,230
-I used to have neuro-dermatitis.

99
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,100
-And how this went away?

100
00:10:48,200 --> 00:11:10,070
-It ended with the birth of the child.

101
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:16,350
- Further therapy for the child was now ointment with olive oil and aqua cream

102
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:33,520
 and she baths him with soya bean oil once the week.

103
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:52,400
It has been significant high Klebsiella oxytoca in his stool.

104
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:59,650
He was fully breast fed until 8 months but now he eats bananas, apples, carrots,

105
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:07,540
corn, chicken, buns rice waffles and milk powder and biscuits.

106
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:18,040
He needs nursing to fall asleep, motorically he is an early developer since 97 he is

107
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:25,950
crawling, since beginning of June he tries to walk and since August 16 he walks.

108
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:34,630
His teething was late, first tooth came in July 97, nine months of age, his weight and height

109
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:47,560
according to percentile. 10th of May he had an intestine flu.

110
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,800
-How it was treated?

111
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:56,060
-It was just diet and mother milk.

112
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,300
-No medicine.

113
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:12,690
-He still has some slight milk crust he received Calcarea carb. C200 in 20th of August.

114
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:20,570
-What was the effect of Calc. carb.?

115
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:27,320
-He reacted very well to Calc. carb. You can't really tell in detail because at the

116
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,580
same time we went to the sea.

117
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,840
-Which sea?

118
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:43,820
-Northern sea. I don't really know if it's the effect of the sea or of the Calc. carb.

119
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,580
-After Calc. carb. anything else, except of the eczema changed?

120
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,580
-No.

121
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,320
-The child perspires during sleep in bed?

122
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,330
-When I'm nursing so that he falls asleep, before he falls asleep he gets wet at

123
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:06,820
his neck.

124
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,080
-He is constipated at all?

125
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,320
-No.

126
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,440
-There are other symptoms that she has noticed?

127
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,160
-Another thing that we remarked and which puzzled us was that he never scratches

128
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:44,660
what we know otherwise from neuro-dermatitis. He never does that. Never.

129
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,400
-Does he eat eggs now?

130
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,380
-No.

131
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,990
-You don't give him or he doesn't like?

132
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,240
-He doesn't get any.

133
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,990
-She does not give him.

134
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:04,740
-No.

135
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:15,490
-I don't see this child to be sick, considering that he had all this vaccination, he should

136
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:22,990
be much more ill, than he appears to be. Most probably both Sulphur and Calcarea

137
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:33,860
have acted and Calcarea followed Sulphur well and both these remedies have acted well

138
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:45,320
and you just wait to see. Because I don't see any problem with his skin at the moment.

139
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:53,070
So that means the remedies have acted well and he should not take any other

140
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:55,180
remedy at this time.

141
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,560
-We thought was that shortly before we flied here to Alonissos, it started all over again.

142
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:08,980
It got worse, I can show you where it is.

143
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:17,480
-Now it is full blown or it is medium or it just started?

144
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:25,150
-It is pretty decent for the time being. Not very much at the moment.

145
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:38,650
-Show me.

146
00:16:38,750 --> 00:17:07,110
-You see these red pustules

147
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:16,350
-And he was absolutely clear before, in Germany?

148
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:36,560
-No, the only thing was it wasn't red anymore. It still had this roughness. Dry and rough.

149
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:42,190
-And no itching?

150
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:51,950
-No scratching. I don't know if it itches.

151
00:17:52,050 --> 00:18:01,640
-Yes, you will know. In her case it was the same place?

152
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:12,940
-I only had it in my arms, my hands and my face.

153
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,950
-Also you did not scratch?

154
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,940
-Yes, I did.

155
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,190
-It was itching?

156
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:25,440
-Very itching.

157
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,190
-Now she has nothing?

158
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:38,600
-Nothing.

159
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:51,850
-The moment that they came here, the eruption became better?

160
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,850
-The second day yes.

161
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:00,860
-How much better, 50%?

162
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:14,600
-Yes, you can say 50%.

163
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:24,100
-And what is the position in his sleep?

164
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,010
-On his tummy.

165
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,690
-Flat or he puts his hands like this?

166
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:38,010
-Sometimes he lies completely flat and sometimes he bends his knees and his elbows

167
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,010
both.

168
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:46,180
-Is he groaning and moaning?

169
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:57,420
-He moans a lot when he is tired and if he doesn't get what he wants.

170
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,170
-But does this make her irritable?

171
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:13,920
-Partly yes. I leave the room for 5 min. I count up to 10 and then come back.

172
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:21,930
-Then you have an exercise.

173
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:26,670
There is a lot of salivation?

174
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:34,840
-When he is teething yes and during the first 3 months too.

175
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,340
-How many teeth have come out already?

176
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,790
-Five.

177
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:50,260
-When they put him in bed in his cradle, he always calm down?

178
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,920
-During the first 3 months yes. When he was smaller.

179
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:07,260
Now he is more interested in looking around than sleep anymore.

180
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:14,050
-Did he have any rash around his nates around his genitalia?

181
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:27,860
-Yes, redness but it was never been a candida.

182
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:36,360
-I didn't ask about candida, I asked if that redness was like an eruption, very red.

183
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,780
-No.

184
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,940
-How she will describe his character?

185
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:49,890
-He is strong willed, very happy, normally he laughs with everybody, he doesn't feel

186
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:55,640
strange to others, he is not shy with strangers, he is interested about nearly

187
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:04,050
everything, he looks for flowers and what he sees he is very interested.

188
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,550
-How much milk he takes now? He takes outside milk than his mother's?

189
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,800
-No, just mother milk.

190
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,560
-Liquids other type he takes a lot?

191
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:29,550
-He drinks a lot of herbal tea or water.

192
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:44,300
During the pregnancy I have been treated with acupuncture because of my hay fever.

193
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:51,720
I don't know if this is of any relevance.

194
00:22:51,820 --> 00:23:17,280
-Probably it is some hereditary predisposition.

195
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:27,410
-I was in the airplane together with this child, they sat aside of me.

196
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:39,160
The child constantly came up, crawled on my lap and wanted to drink out of my bottle.

197
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:45,910
And always when he returned to his mother, he was dominating, being a little tyrant

198
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:53,910
towards his mother. Like she said, when she gets angry she counts to 10 and she

199
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:57,910
doesn't show anger but I have the impression she doesn't have any control over this

200
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:08,160
child. And I had the impression with the child run out of the room yesterday, it would

201
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:18,910
have gone with everybody and would have been happy.

202
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,910
Me too I would give Medorrhinum.

203
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:32,410
-I thought of Medorrhinum because he was ameliorated by the sea, when he was in

204
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,160
they came here to Alonissos, she said he is now OK.

205
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:41,660
He was bad a few days ago and as soon as they arrive here, he was OK.

206
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,830
-Concerning his sleep I just wanted to say that his improvement was just in the beginning after

207
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:58,880
12 o'clock he was waking very frequently in our days, up to 20 times the night.

208
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,550
She just told me that yesterday he woke up all the time during the night.

209
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:10,020
Not in general but very often he wakes up and he always need her breast and then

210
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:21,970
he goes to sleep again.

211
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:30,710
-In a case where you are doing a follow up, that is a follow up after Sulphur, which was

212
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:39,220
successful and Calc. carb. which seems also to be correct, you are doing a follow up

213
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,210
after two correct remedies. You have to judge on two things.

214
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:57,570
Whether the pathology which is there justifies a prescription, absolutely justifies the

215
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:11,300
prescription and the second consideration is whether the remedy is clear, you have any

216
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:18,050
clear indication.

217
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:30,550
Pathology and clear remedy. In this boy we have some symptoms.

218
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,550
Which are the symptoms?

219
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:49,300
There is the pathology which is eruptions on bends of joints and the second is

220
00:26:49,400 --> 00:27:13,190
what is the main symptom of that child on which you could think of a remedy?

221
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:38,910
Medorrhinum, Calc. phosp., Kal carb. mostly.

222
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:44,080
What other symptom you have for this child?

223
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:53,590
Amelioration at the sea. What else?

224
00:27:53,690 --> 00:28:02,860
-She was already describing an anal eczema, an eczema around the nates.

225
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,820
-Not really.

226
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:19,150
-Sweat around his head and his neck.

227
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:40,910
-By the time he is falling asleep. During nursing.

228
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:47,160
-What is remarkable too is he doesn't like to be dressed up warmly but he loves the

229
00:28:47,260 --> 00:29:03,910
warm bath and that is amazing.

230
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:13,160
-He is too warm and he likes warm bath.

231
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,690
-It was mentioned too that he sleeps better when he is pushed around his stroller or

232
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:34,350
by the vibration of the car.

233
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:39,100
-He only can sleep when he has been eating before.

234
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:56,850
-No.

235
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:15,850
-Concerning point one he has redness behind his ears together with pus.

236
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:21,100
-You can not make a prescription with all these?

237
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:47,540
-He said he developed quickly but his dentition was slow.

238
00:30:47,640 --> 00:31:01,300
-He walked early because usually it's over one year, so it's early.

239
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:08,940
You wrote down all these symptoms and the question you are asking is the second

240
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:17,130
question, is this clear? Is this presenting a clear case?

241
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:25,130
You can argue with any of these symptoms that they are not symptoms.

242
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:36,380
With every one of them, even the eruption show something without itching, why you

243
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:44,630
bother? Knee-elbow position, all the children are...

244
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:50,880
and then amelioration in the sea, doubtful. Was the remedy, was the sea?

245
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,110
We don't know.

246
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:58,290
Sweats on scalp, only during nursing and a little bit.

247
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:06,250
After vaccination. There are so many vaccinations which he took ,we don't know

248
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,660
which one.

249
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:18,080
Too warm, likes warm bath. You can not make anything out of that.

250
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:25,040
Better vibration, it's not there anymore.

251
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:34,020
Finally you don't have a real, clear symptomatology like him, he had this drop

252
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,460
it was very clear. He does not have.

253
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:47,210
At the same time the child you would expect that the child would have some

254
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:53,130
disturbances, especially after so many vaccinations.

255
00:32:53,230 --> 00:33:08,130
He, throughout, has a deeper tendency for allergy but not aggressively.

256
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:19,790
The child has all these good qualities, are you going to give a remedy to this child?

257
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:28,530
You have to wait and see how it develops. The whole issue of this may stay on

258
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:34,630
a very mild level or it may even disappear.

259
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:47,380
Then once you have really some pathology to deal with, then you don't interfere with

260
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:57,380
a case that has taken two correct remedies.

261
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:04,880
You may disturb the child and you may see this eruption with Sulphur becoming

262
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,880
unbearable.

263
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:20,880
Especially with the last information that the child wakes up frequently for breast

264
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:28,130
feeding.

265
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:34,540
If you put it there, you will see Sulphur.

266
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:45,290
Also the child, according to me, was moaning, he was crying with little reasons.

267
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:52,040
There is a tendency for moaning, which again shows the possibility for the

268
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:59,040
Calc. phos. which is a possibility for the knee-elbow position.

269
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,540
But you don't give it at this moment.

270
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,740
At this moment, after two correct prescriptions, don't try to make things better than the

271
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:16,800
organism can do because you may have the opposite effect.

272
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:27,300
The child is developing nicely, his bone structure is good, Calc. carb. is out of question

273
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:36,800
in spite of the sweating in the scalp, the sweat is not so great, you do not have the

274
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:44,300
desire for soft boiled eggs, no.

275
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:51,540
The child must not take a remedy because none of these symptoms we wrote down

276
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:59,960
are strong enough to persuade us that some deeper disturbance is going on.

277
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:07,960
There is a possibility of course for Medorrhinum, for Calc. phos. and maybe he may

278
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:20,960
develop into Calc. carb. It was already given and it seems that it has acted.

279
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:27,370
Maybe he will go back to Calc. carb. and needs repetition.

280
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:36,130
Maybe he will go to Medorrhinum, especially if he develop a rash between genitalia

281
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:46,510
and nates all this area in Medorrhinum children becomes very red and painful.

282
00:36:46,610 --> 00:37:02,600
It is an eruption, it's not only a redness, it's very strong, dark redness.

283
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:13,340
Therefore the answer is no remedy.

284
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:24,510
Who wrote no remedy. Very good.

285
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:29,810
You see you are getting so good.
