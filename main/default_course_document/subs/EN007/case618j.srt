1
00:00:21,207 --> 00:00:30,487
This is the 8th follow-up of a young girl we saw 9 years ago

2
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:40,968
with the diagnosis of pubertas praecox where very early menses started

3
00:00:43,407 --> 00:00:59,279
and for this syndrome it is compulsory, I think, in your country to take hormone treatment...

4
00:00:59,664 --> 00:01:14,496
- Every 28 days.
– So we started treatment with Med.

5
00:01:15,216 --> 00:01:27,264
which she has received in several repeated doses, she had Lach., Phos., Lyc., Stram.

6
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:38,640
I prescribed Stram.? 
– Yes, each year. I didn’t touch the case.

7
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:46,753
– Puls. She has not taken any other homeopathic remedies?
– Only Bell. in acute state.

8
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:55,720
Or Dros. once but nothing else.
– Now, as you can see she has developed quite nicely,

9
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,768
she’s not taking the hormones since a few years already...- Since nearly 5 years.

10
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:17,425
– She was supposed not to develop according to the standards.

11
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:27,144
She’s good in school and catching some cold rarely, otherwise she feels quite healthy.

12
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:32,232
Her menses are irregular, what do you mean?

13
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:43,184
Misses menses, sometimes very short menses?
– Very short. It’s different.

14
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,480
Sometimes it’s too long period, sometimes it’s too short, it’s not arriving every 28 days.

15
00:02:51,041 --> 00:03:00,072
– Before menses your psychology changes, you’re irritable, depressed, anxious?

16
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:15,688

46
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:06,849
According to my understanding she is quite good and we should not interfere at all.

47
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:18,199
Let her develop normally and she is quite a healthy child as I can see and I can also read.

48
00:08:20,152 --> 00:08:35,048
There is no need at this moment, she has developed nicely. She’s almost at your height!

49
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:43,400
– But she was not here last year and I thought it would be better for you to see her.

50
00:08:43,944 --> 00:08:51,744
– Yes. It is good to see that she is developing and she may marry and have children,

51
00:08:52,160 --> 00:09:05,744
then I live until 250. Ok, that’s it, no medication! Thank you!
