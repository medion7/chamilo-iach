1
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:28,695
What was the main problem?

2
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:34,822
– Pubertas praecox. It’s early puberty.

3
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:40,706
When she was already 2 years old she got her menses.

4
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:45,335
– What was the original remedy?

5
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:50,182
– Medorrhinum and then last year you gave Lachesis

6
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:53,015
because there was a lot of jealousy in the case.

7
00:00:55,062 --> 00:01:00,695
The fear of the parents was that she doesn’t grow anymore after 7 years

8
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:07,586
because the puberty was stopped when she was 7 and then she remains small,

9
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:10,662
that was the biggest fear in the case because now she is growing very fast

10
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:20,142
and after this will stop.
– Now she is 7?

11
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:42,662
– In 30th August she will become 7. Should I say from the last year or from the basics?

12
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:45,742
– From the last year...

13
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,942
- From the last year I got a report from the mother that she doesn’t see

14
00:01:54,942 --> 00:02:01,858
and changes since Lachesis, only that Nickola is more independent

15
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:10,818
but she thinks because she is going to school now and it’s normal for her age.

16
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,290
The mother cannot really realize any changes and in school she is good

17
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:32,062
and there are no complains and the mother says she got some challenges now

18
00:02:32,302 --> 00:02:37,698
because she needs some challenges, she’s got much energy...

19
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,452
– She’s got much energy and she needs challenge?

20
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:45,783
Does she attack her mother verbally?

21
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:52,460
– And also they fight.
– With fists?

22
00:02:54,743 --> 00:03:01,420
– Yes.
– Not so often with me but very often with her mother,

23
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:10,103
she punches and cries very much. She cries to her mother “you don’t love me”.

24
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:17,292
–“I hate you, you don’t love me” and kinds like this.

25
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:22,412
For example says she is very demanding.

26
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,982
When she wants something then she wants to get it immediately

27
00:03:26,252 --> 00:03:31,863
and cannot stop after to demand. For 2 hours she is demanding,

28
00:03:32,902 --> 00:03:35,462
you hate me and you don’t give me that,

29
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,342
there is no stop for 2 hours after demanding something when she wants something.

30
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:46,220
She has much energy and the mother says thanks God she is in school now,

31
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:50,822
where she has some challenge.
– Much power!

32
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:56,183
– But that she already had it before Lachesis.

33
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,822
She always had a lot of power and fits of rage coming back after the Medorrhinum.

34
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,742
Medorrhinum brought back the suppressed fits of rage.

35
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:18,982
– Now when she sleeps she needs a light or can she sleep in darkness?

36
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:25,382
– Her mother says there’s no problem, she prefers little light but not too much.

37
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:36,382
– She used to talk in her sleep. Is she talking in her sleep?

38
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:40,492
– Sometimes yes, she is talking during sleep.

39
00:04:43,052 --> 00:04:46,380
And a certain fear of thunderstorms and rains.

40
00:04:49,452 --> 00:05:03,532
A little bit, not much, and also for rain a little. Now she says no.

41
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:20,422
– Is she seen masturbating?
– No, it was 2 years before she was here but not now.

42
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,852
– Neither you have noticed doing it in her own, when she is in bed?

43
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:36,023
– I don’t know, I don’t live with her, I haven’t seen it.

44
00:05:36,542 --> 00:05:42,423
As I remember the mother also doesn’t know.

45
00:05:47,302 --> 00:05:55,223
But what was very intense is that she is always playing the leader among the children

46
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:58,822
and when they play something she wants to be the first and the leader.

47
00:05:59,582 --> 00:06:05,982
She is demanding to other children and when other children leave her she is very sad

48
00:06:06,252 --> 00:06:08,812
and she says they don’t like me.

49
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,462
But she is provocative that the mother says that it’s no wonder why they leave you.

50
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:25,702
She is very demanding and aggressive and dominant.

51
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:32,862
– She does this with you also?
– She tries it.

52
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:37,982
– To be the most important person the mother says.

53
00:06:38,502 --> 00:06:43,102
She always seems to be the most important person. She wants to be in the middle.

54
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:52,332
– But she does it in another way with me.
– She tries to make you do things.

55
00:06:52,823 --> 00:07:00,780
– Yes, with smile.
– With the mother she is more aggressive.

56
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:11,782
And when the mother explains something to her, for example you caught a cold

57
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,932
and now you cannot go to the pool, she explains to her because you can catch a cold

58
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:21,260
and I don’t want, it’s cold already and it is evening,

59
00:07:21,772 --> 00:07:27,142
then she is very sad and shouting you don’t love me!

60
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,223
When others forbid something she cannot accept.

61
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:41,222
The father says to me that the mother has another outcome of vibration

62
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,303
and she reacts on this and he is another person,

63
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,980
has another vibration so she is reacting completely different

64
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:57,342
and the father says this is because the mother has another vibration.

65
00:07:57,612 --> 00:08:10,412
–She is more aggressive, low energy and this vibration makes her nervous.

66
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:15,532
– He also doesn’t feel sometimes very comfortable in her presence.

67
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,582
He offered the mother that she can come this time with the girl to Greece

68
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:31,902
and the mother refused

69
00:08:32,172 --> 00:08:38,302
because I think the mother isn’t really understanding this treatment.

70
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:46,252
It’s a little difficult also for me to explain how that can be a miracle and work.

71
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:55,462
It took long time till May till the mother was ready to come for a follow up.

72
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,782
She doesn’t believe in that way.

73
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:05,943
– I told her that she should come with us but I told her only for 3 days

74
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:11,582
and it’s stressing flying and going by boat. She said, no I don’t like it,

75
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:18,502
but she wants to come here if 1 week of holidays will follow.

76
00:09:23,102 --> 00:09:27,462
– You could pay her.
– Yes, I think so.

77
00:09:34,622 --> 00:09:41,022
– Her height is still growing fast?
– It’s normal now.

78
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:54,583
– Her height is within normal range?
– She is 10cm too high for her age.

79
00:10:06,892 --> 00:10:16,862
– Snoring in sleep is still there?
– Very much. But not every night.

80
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:28,652
3 months before she was sucking her finger.

81
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:50,662
But she is finished now and now she takes dental device for her teeth to be in order,

82
00:11:05,772 --> 00:11:13,702
dental correction.
– You don’t know if she still talks in her sleep.

83
00:11:17,022 --> 00:11:21,900
– Her mother says she still talks sometimes.

84
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:43,383
– She has impulses to kill?
– No.

85
00:11:45,943 --> 00:11:56,183
– But strike?
– Yes. But not kill.

86
00:11:58,502 --> 00:12:05,420
– Ask her if she wants to strike and she holds back, tries to control herself.

87
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:22,572
No response. Is any salivation in the night in bed? Saliva running in the pillow?

88
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:35,102
– It was before but now there is no sign.
– Her gums are ok?

89
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:49,182
– They are ok, teeth are ok.
– And she had previously any otitis?

90
00:12:52,012 --> 00:13:01,740
– Sometimes if she goes to cold water. 2 months ago she had otitis in one side.

91
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:09,420
– You gave a remedy?
– They didn’t call me.

92
00:13:09,662 --> 00:13:17,100
– They gave antibiotics.
– No antibiotics. She hasn’t get any antibiotics in her life.

93
00:13:19,142 --> 00:13:32,460
– But the inflammation went away by itself.
– Her mother gave her anti-inflammatory drugs.

94
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:42,423
– She had fever?
– No fever but very much pain in the night, right ear.

95
00:13:43,462 --> 00:13:49,342
And she got a packing aid pharmacy and she got anti-inflammatory drug

96
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:56,780
but only one time because she was weeping with pain.

97
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:07,262
– Does she have the habit of spitting frequently?
– No.

98
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:24,940
- I got that she feels like an outsider. Although she is a dominant person,

99
00:14:25,182 --> 00:14:30,060
directing everybody she often feels like an outsider, nobody loves me

100
00:14:34,412 --> 00:14:37,222
and complaining the others go home.

101
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,822
That was very dominant when talking with the mother.

102
00:14:45,932 --> 00:14:53,862
She loves dancing and loud music but only when she wants it.

103
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,220
For example she puts on loud music and dances when she like it

104
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:02,302
and when the mother another time she puts on loud music she doesn’t like

105
00:15:02,822 --> 00:15:08,460
and says to turn it off.
– Who gave you this information?

106
00:15:08,702 --> 00:15:16,140
– The mother.  After many months I met with her, it was not so easy.

107
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:35,852
– The fear of dark and ghosts she gave originally?
– It’s not much. Little bit.

108
00:15:37,382 --> 00:15:45,303
– Sometimes I ask her if she sees something that is not real of if someone speaks to her.

109
00:15:46,342 --> 00:15:51,703
I asked her yesterday and she told me that grandpa

110
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:56,823
who died 2 years before he speaks to her.

111
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:09,623
– She is having no constipation?
– Sometimes.

112
00:16:11,942 --> 00:16:21,420
– How many hours she sleeps?
– Very long from 8 p.m. to 7 a.m.

113
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:36,262
– Almost 12 hours. But in the morning when she wakes she is not in a good mood,

114
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:50,583
very irritable. Because during the week she has to go to school.

115
00:16:52,382 --> 00:16:55,980
– She is very irritable in the morning.

116
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:04,422
– She has to go to school and she doesn’t like it?
– No, she likes going to school

117
00:17:04,663 --> 00:17:10,302
but going out of the bed she doesn’t like it.
– Does she eat a lot of sweets?

118
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:20,812
– In the morning?
– During the whole day. Every day she needs sweets?

119
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:31,820
– Sometimes, not every day.

120
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:37,702
When she was younger she was 5 she asked me for sweets every day

121
00:17:37,943 --> 00:17:45,900
but now she asks for apple or pineapple.
– What does she like to eat now?

122
00:17:48,702 --> 00:18:02,540
– Pizza, fish still, ice cream very much.
–Big thirst?

123
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:13,292
– No she drinks less. Her mother told her to drink more water but she doesn’t like.

124
00:18:21,982 --> 00:18:25,303
– You do not know if she grinds her teeth?

125
00:18:27,622 --> 00:18:39,383
– No. I asked her mother and I can see in a kid if someone is pressing the teeth.

126
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:48,102
– She’s very capricious? She wants something and then she doesn’t like it.

127
00:18:52,702 --> 00:19:05,772
– Yes, she has that. She demands something and then the next moment...

128
00:19:08,062 --> 00:19:12,172
- When I get her a present she looks, play and...

129
00:19:12,422 --> 00:19:16,780
- In front of you she does this?
– Yes, looks, plays and...

130
00:19:19,852 --> 00:19:28,023
- You told me once she is almost as demanding as the mother.

131
00:19:32,652 --> 00:19:37,772
The mother demands from him good life-style and she demands the same

132
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:42,103
and he was a little upset because of this.

133
00:19:48,780 --> 00:20:01,303
She is on one hand she is coquettish like in puberty and she like movies

134
00:20:01,822 --> 00:20:10,022
and TV shows with super models and super star shows

135
00:20:12,332 --> 00:20:15,902
and she also has longing for horror movies

136
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:21,022
but her mother doesn’t allow her, of course. She is fascinated by these things.

137
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:31,020
It’s not fitting to her age. He tells me that she already watches films

138
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:34,932
like the Pirates of the Caribbean with Johnny Depp,

139
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:52,930
it’s a film for adults already one year ago and she was not in fear of it.

140
00:20:55,222 --> 00:21:02,902
She can stand all these films. He says he wouldn’t have stood them at that age.

141
00:21:04,942 --> 00:21:12,622
– Was there any times when she had worms in her intestines, in the stool?

142
00:21:22,102 --> 00:21:44,622
-No but sometimes she has pain in the abdomen but depends on the stool.

143
00:21:45,662 --> 00:21:49,502
– She has pain and then diarrhea?

144
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:54,862
– She has pain when she goes to the toilet and then it is finished.

145
00:21:56,142 --> 00:22:01,538
– After stool the pain is gone. But she was vomiting quite a lot, I think.

146
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:12,022
– Vomiting at 6 a.m. sometimes. But not every day.

147
00:22:12,782 --> 00:22:20,462
Every 3-4 weeks I think this could depend on what she has eaten.

148
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:34,050
– She has a big appetite? She eats a lot but she does not put in weight?

149
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:47,342
– Yes. The Professor in Vienna told me when I give her hormones

150
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:55,298
her weight will increase but it doesn’t happen.

151
00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:05,262
– In this year how many centimeters she grew?
– Nearly 3-4 cm.

152
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:24,462
– Fear of thunderstorms is still there?
– Yes but 2-3 years before it was more intense.

153
00:23:28,302 --> 00:23:35,222
– Now the menses are appearing or not?– Not at all.

154
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,582
– She is still gets the hormones.

155
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:49,302
– Her nose bleeds sometimes?– No. I haven’t seen it.

156
00:23:49,822 --> 00:23:52,622
– Never?– Never.

157
00:23:53,902 --> 00:24:02,370
– Does she complain that her tips are numb?– No.

158
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:17,982
– Her knees are very cold?
– No knees but feet are sometimes cold.

159
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:32,062
– Still likes ice cream a lot?
– Very much. In summer if it is warm 3-4 ice creams.

160
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:42,050
Give me ice cream! She likes strawberry and mango ice.

161
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:49,982
– Chocolate?
– She likes.

162
00:24:54,850 --> 00:25:05,342
– If you are sick she will care, she will be anxious, have you noticed anything like that?

163
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:18,658
– She takes care, if I come and my head is aching she comes but she is not anxious.

164
00:25:20,182 --> 00:25:30,178
– No fear but she takes care.
– But fear of dark and ghosts is less.

165
00:25:31,702 --> 00:25:40,418
– In the medium, not panic but... When she sleeps she wants a little light.

166
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:47,822
– But when there are thunderstorms she gets really panicky?

167
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:58,338
She said yes, she answered herself. She has not said anything else.

168
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:17,262
Concerning the evaluation of the treatment so far,

169
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:28,290
I don’t think that homeopathic remedies have done anything so far.

170
00:26:30,582 --> 00:26:49,262
If i take the reports from the mother as being true. The remedy at this moment that appears is...

171
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:01,058
repeat capriciousness, dictatorial, fear of thunderstorms,

172
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:06,178
irritability in morning when waking, striking, talking in sleep,

173
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:13,582
vomiting early in the morning, stool after pain ameliorates,

174
00:27:14,622 --> 00:27:25,102
snoring in children, fish desire, ice cream desire

175
00:27:28,942 --> 00:27:46,102
and you see her behavior is of course the behavior of a grown-up woman.

176
00:27:53,262 --> 00:28:01,982
There is also aggressiveness and therefore I thought for a moment of Nux-v.

177
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:19,138
That was showing also in the repertorization. I said put this symptom

178
00:28:19,382 --> 00:28:26,050
and then showed me Nux-v and the symptom went right on the top.

179
00:28:27,822 --> 00:28:40,898
Between Nux-vomica and Phosphorus... Definitely there is a Phosphorus... Tuberculinum also.

180
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:56,502
There is any tuberculosis in the family?
– As far as he know there is no TB.

181
00:29:02,142 --> 00:29:05,730
– My father and my grandfather were in war...

182
00:29:06,742 --> 00:29:13,662
- We don’t know whether there is TB or not.

183
00:29:14,178 --> 00:29:19,542
Phosphorus and Nux vomica are possible remedies.

184
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:26,210
– What is her feeling for consolation?

185
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:43,862
– If she has pain, she comes to me and cries and then I take her and then it’s finished.

186
00:29:47,970 --> 00:30:03,582
– That’s in favor of Phos.
– I wonder if she still puts things in her mouth.

187
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:14,062
–No, he says she has stopped. A few months before she stopped sucking.

188
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:24,578
– Can I ask why you did not take the symptom of early menses?

189
00:30:25,582 --> 00:30:37,890
– Is too early! That’s why! I don’t know if that fits. You can put add early menses.

190
00:30:40,702 --> 00:30:49,662
If you add this there are going to be quite a lot of remedies. 126 remedies.

191
00:30:55,022 --> 00:31:12,450
– Menses appear before proper age.
– Add this 3 times.

192
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:20,382
– What is your opinion about Carcinosin in the case?

193
00:31:47,502 --> 00:31:53,410
– Can we use the symptom precocity?

194
00:31:54,422 --> 00:32:05,182
– Yes precocity should be there. Mercury is there? Where is Mercury?

195
00:32:07,982 --> 00:32:42,050
Use this 3 times. Use it 2 times. Use it 1 time.

196
00:33:36,706 --> 00:33:47,222
– Is there any sweating?
– George about perspiration.

197
00:33:54,902 --> 00:34:07,942
– On the armpits. Precocity is usually used in little children

198
00:34:12,546 --> 00:34:19,222
who do not have this problem. She has problem in the hormonal system.

199
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:26,626
So she acts because of hormones as a grown woman.

200
00:34:28,182 --> 00:34:40,215
Precocity has to be taken with some precocity. But still you can use it.

201
00:34:46,102 --> 00:34:51,222
– Calcarea phosphorica.

202
00:35:09,932 --> 00:35:17,342
– He lost some weight, I don’t like that he has to put on some weight!

203
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:29,623
– He is very controlled he doesn’t want to get fat.

204
00:35:44,492 --> 00:35:49,862
– I was thinking of Veratrum album because she is a little girl being so dictatorial,

205
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:57,542
disappointed if the others go away, she is vomiting in the morning,

206
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:08,542
desire for ice, not ice cream, is in favor of Verat. The enuresis...

207
00:36:12,382 --> 00:36:18,782
- How is Verat.?

208
00:36:27,500 --> 00:37:00,503
– How many? 8 symptoms. Put precocity in 3 Veratrum album comes up.

209
00:37:01,783 --> 00:37:04,862
– His opinion is that both remedies Medorrhinum and Lachesis brought something

210
00:37:05,382 --> 00:37:14,342
but the mother cannot realize it but he says she was not so childish anymore,

211
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:23,302
she got better constitution.
– She became calmer.

212
00:37:23,543 --> 00:37:27,383
– Not so much crying with red head.

213
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:39,180
– The father says with the remedies we gave she became calmer,

214
00:37:39,942 --> 00:37:51,703
she is not beating so much etc. Veratrum album is a good idea. I don’t know.

215
00:37:52,742 --> 00:38:09,382
The salt she needs is a lot? What about lemons? Takes a lemon and eats?

216
00:38:11,692 --> 00:38:39,852
– It’s not so good, it’s very sour.
– Ice cubes, maybe she likes them but lemon;

217
00:38:40,343 --> 00:38:56,222
she puts it in the mouth but doesn’t like it so much. Restlessness? Sometimes.

218
00:39:02,622 --> 00:39:11,582
The thing that makes me think of Phos. is the fact that after all these questions

219
00:39:13,132 --> 00:39:20,300
she answered she is afraid of thunderstorms.

220
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:26,423
So I think we have to take into consideration this.

221
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:32,332
Also we have to take into consideration the fact that she cares

222
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:40,012
and also the fact that the father says if I take her in my lap she will stop.

223
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:45,900
Everything is ok. That means she needs affection.

224
00:39:46,142 --> 00:39:56,902
Is a child who needs a lot of affection and then the other thing is

225
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:04,823
that she would be bleeding quite a lot if she hadn’t taken the hormones.

226
00:40:10,732 --> 00:40:28,902
I would prefer Phos. But take it 30C every day for 10 days

227
00:40:31,703 --> 00:40:44,780
and if there is an effect and see it

228
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:52,183
and then it can go 32C for another 10 days 34C another ten days etc. for a month.

229
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:10,103
I don’t know what changes may be observed.

230
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:22,142
The problem is we don’t really have the real symptoms

231
00:41:22,662 --> 00:41:30,342
because they are covered by the injections. You cannot go back...

232
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:44,422
Do they measure hormonal levels? If you go before the injection.

233
00:41:59,782 --> 00:42:05,420
– For how long this treatment he says must be given?

234
00:42:24,102 --> 00:42:26,412
– Professor Waldhausen in Vienna told me

235
00:42:27,692 --> 00:42:41,772
that the hormones will continue until she is 150 cm. Then it won’t act anymore.

236
00:42:43,543 --> 00:42:57,900
Now she is 134 cm. I think we have 3-4 years time to continue.

237
00:43:00,183 --> 00:43:06,583
But we are forced in Austria to give hormones by the law.

238
00:43:15,543 --> 00:43:26,572
– One of the characteristic of Phos. in connection with this child is what?

239
00:43:39,102 --> 00:43:55,223
Grows fast. Phos. has this characteristic, Phos. children grow very fast very soon.

240
00:43:56,012 --> 00:43:59,582
So she has this characteristic as well.

241
00:44:01,623 --> 00:44:07,262
We will see whether this treatment may have a more dramatic effect.
