1
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:22,217
He was born normal child and he developed autism after,

2
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:25,272
when he was a year and a half, he was immunized

3
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:30,336
and shortly after that he became severely autistic.

4
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:34,080
However even before there were certain...

5
00:00:34,999 --> 00:00:43,823
- What were the vaccinations?<br/>– MMR, mumps, measles, rubella.

6
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:48,295
– That’s all? Previously did he have other vaccination?

7
00:00:49,727 --> 00:00:55,631
– A few, not all, because we were postponing everything. I don’t like vaccination.

8
00:00:56,096 --> 00:00:59,495
– Why were you postponing? Were you afraid?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,616
– I didn’t like vaccinations at all but I could not find a way to get rid of it

10
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:10,617
because I knew in Canada it’s not a law but I couldn’t find a way...

11
00:01:11,256 --> 00:01:15,888
- To bypass?<br/>– Yes. Everybody was telling there is a paper

12
00:01:16,304 --> 00:01:18,633
but I could not find how to get the paper.

13
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:26,752
So I did get find out from Helen when he was at the age of 3 and he didn’t have after that any.

14
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:35,328
So I was postponing all.<br/>– That means he had at the age of 6 months he had some?

15
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:37,831
– Yes,some.

16
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,783
– Do you remember to give me an idea of what exactly happened with the vaccinations?

17
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:46,368
– He only had one reaction.

18
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:51,759
– When was the first vaccination and what was the vaccination?

19
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:58,032
– I think he was 2 months old but I don’t know what...

20
00:02:00,063 --> 00:02:12,631
-Usually in Canada at 2,5 months they do diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.

21
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:29,464
– That was 2 months. Then again?<br/>– I don’t remember. I have a paper.

22
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,015
– But you don’t have it with you.<br/>– But he didn’t react to them.

23
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:40,816
– There was a preparation on the organism by these vaccinations

24
00:02:41,232 --> 00:02:47,336
and when the third time came the vaccination then the organism broke down,

25
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:52,672
it doesn’t break down like that but the last vaccination...what was it?

26
00:02:53,408 --> 00:03:08,144
– MMR. And it was an anamnesis? It was given this before and repeated?

27
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:14,583
– No, it was the first time.<br/>– And it was 1,5 year old.

28
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,320
– At that time also I stopped breast feeding him, so he was breastfed until 18 months.

29
00:03:22,016 --> 00:03:28,088
He got rubella and 2 months after that he got his first big fever,

30
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:31,976
with sore throat, treated with antibiotics.

31
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:36,528
– You gave him antibiotics?<br/>– Not she, the doctor.

32
00:03:37,096 --> 00:03:43,959
- She is a doctor?–<br/>No. The doctor gave it. And then we went to Serbia,

33
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:52,319
because we are originally from Serbia and my husband’s mother died,

34
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:58,080
then we went back to Canada, the kid got again throat infection,

35
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,944
again treated with double antibiotics too

36
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:11,967
and after that I noticed something he was... lost.

37
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,880
– So there was a vaccination,

38
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:23,776
then after the vaccination there were several times tonsillitis, 2 times or 3?

39
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:33,360
– 3 times. First, before Serbia and then after Serbia in a 6-month period.

40
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,704
– And the last time he needed double antibiotics?<br/>– Yes.

41
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:47,896
- He needed double antibiotics because the fever would not go down?

42
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:53,679
– Yes. So sad.<br/>– Also the trauma.

43
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:59,968
She mentioned to me that when she stopped breastfeeding he became very sad.

44
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:09,327
– He never reacted. And it surprised me because I went to a friend for 2 days

45
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:15,191
and then I came back and... he loved breastfeeding and he never reacted.

46
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,544
And I felt terrible because we were sort of talking to each other

47
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:22,928
and I was asking him are you ready to cut off?

48
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:33,296
So we cut it off and he didn’t react to it and I found it very strange,

49
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:40,439
I felt as if I had betrayed my child because he didn’t react to something he really liked,

50
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:47,063
he never asked about anything ever. He suppressed his reaction.

51
00:05:54,592 --> 00:06:00,983
– When you cut the breastfeeding there was vaccination

52
00:06:02,352 --> 00:06:06,833
and after 3 days or after 3 months you stopped?

53
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:13,817
– I think it was before.<br/>– He was 1 year old, when she stopped breastfeeding.

54
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:16,671
– No, a year and a half.

55
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:21,079
– He was a year and a half when you stopped breastfeeding.<br/>–Exactly.

56
00:06:21,623 --> 00:06:24,032
– Then he was vaccinated.<br/>– Yes.

57
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,743
– How long after that?<br/>– Maybe a few days. 2 weeks the most.

58
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:35,592
– And then the tonsillitis, when did it come?

59
00:06:36,623 --> 00:06:45,903
– This was 15th July, tonsillitis in the beginning of November. So that’s 4 months.

60
00:06:47,143 --> 00:06:58,575
– 4 months later he develops severe tonsillitis. Very high fever?<br/>– Yes, 40-41,5 Celsius.

61
00:06:59,143 --> 00:07:06,031
– Gave him antibiotics, for how long? One week?<br/>– Yes, one week.

62
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:12,327
– Then you go to Serbia.<br/>– There was a big emotional reaction.

63
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,967
He really liked the grandma, he was playing with her on her bed, she died of cancer,

64
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:20,872
so the day that she went to the hospital, he was crying,

65
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,223
he knew that she was going to die.

66
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:28,416
– But by the time you went to Serbia he already was 2 year old?

67
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:37,168
– Not really. It was December.<br/>– 22 months. Has he started talking already?

68
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:49,256
– No, he was late with talking. No. After that his talk diminished.

69
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:53,936
He was talking before that...

70
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:04,479
- You told me that 9 months he talked.<br/>– When he is 1,5 year-old,

71
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:11,888
when you cut breastfeeding, you were communicating by words with him? Yes.

72
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:14,640
– Was he saying yes or no?<br/>– Yes.

73
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,656
– And he could understand what you were asking?<br/>– Yes.

74
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:23,136
After that he drank rice milk, I said bring the bottle,

75
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,624
he went to another room and brought the bottle.

76
00:08:26,528 --> 00:08:29,816
And then at the age of 4 my son couldn’t do that anymore.

77
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,799
And he had words, we were reading the book,

78
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:37,376
what the cow says, moo, he knew all that.

79
00:08:40,504 --> 00:08:45,098
– You must tell that to the authorities.<br/>– I know.

80
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,272
– They don’t want to listen.

81
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,361
– There were a few problems before with him

82
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:57,735
because he started teething very early at 4 months he got his first teeth

83
00:09:00,048 --> 00:09:11,504
and then his teeth at the age of 2 crumbled. In that period they were getting bad.

84
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:17,824
–And the teeth fell off at the age of 2?
– No. Crumbled with lots of cavities.

85
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:30,265
Especially the four front. When he was 1 year old all his teeth were out.

86
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:45,656
– Then when I first saw him in the beginning of 2008

87
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:49,168
he was completely not communicating with anybody.

88
00:09:49,568 --> 00:09:53,000
He was just running around in circles and making noises

89
00:09:54,104 --> 00:10:00,280
and she said that I cannot communicate with my son I cannot get through

90
00:10:00,648 --> 00:10:13,192
and she started crying.<br/>– By that time he was 3 years old.

91
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:21,064
– First, I didn’t know what to do, just running around,

92
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:30,576
I repertorized her and gave her Staphisagria. She’s on one remedy per se.

93
00:10:32,128 --> 00:10:38,056
– You gave to the mother?<br/>– Yes. I do that with the babies too,

94
00:10:38,784 --> 00:10:44,104
I give the mother remedy at first. He also had Staphisagria symptoms with the teeth,

95
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,855
they were all covered with yellow stuff.

96
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,192
– She was not breast feeding him.<br/>- I know. I thought it was the right thing to do.

97
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:58,223
But he reacted to Staphisagria, he started sleeping through the night,

98
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:05,648
so after that I thought about it some more and gave him Carcinosin,

99
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,408
he was doing very well on Carcinosin and half a year later, gave him Tuberculinum,

100
00:11:12,904 --> 00:11:20,000
he had lots of severe allergies. And he was grinding his teeth

101
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:22,729
and was very restless at night and sweaty.

102
00:11:24,544 --> 00:11:31,615
– But he had no teeth. How was he grinding?<br/>– No, they were there, just crumbled.

103
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:41,735
When she said all his teeth were out she meant all teeth were coming out, not falling off.

104
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:46,248
There were there just crumbling. He still is grinding his teeth sometimes.

105
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:51,296
– Yes, on and off. I would like to say about the allergies.

106
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:57,183
When he was a month and a half old from my husband’s side his younger brother

107
00:11:57,792 --> 00:12:07,401
had extreme eczema, as a result of food allergies. But they never tested him.

108
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:13,467
He developed a severe eczema in a month and a half,

109
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:17,315
my mother in law gave him to lick a little bit of chocolate.

110
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:25,315
– One month and half he developed an eczema all over the body.

111
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:32,218
And what did you give? Not homeopathically.

112
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:42,371
– The prescribed cortisone, of course and what I tried, I knew cortisone was bad,

113
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:48,803
we did put some times, not all the time, and then I was testing him through me

114
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:53,755
because he was breastfeeding, I would test him through me for the allergies,

115
00:12:54,747 --> 00:12:58,219
meaning I would exclude wheat for a week and then watch my child,

116
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:07,251
then I would exclude milk for a week, so by his 5,5 months I had a list by testing him

117
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:13,811
and then he didn’t need remedies. That’s what we did.

118
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:19,011
– How do you know that it was not suppressed by the [cortisone] cream already?

119
00:13:20,203 --> 00:13:25,028
– Because they were coming out, if I ate something it would come out, it was really bad.

120
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:28,451
– Again?<br/>– Yes, again and again it comes out.

121
00:13:29,883 --> 00:13:37,635
– But after the finally going away of the eczema did it come out a month later

122
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:43,180
if he ate some allergic food.<br/>– I didn’t eat anything.

123
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:49,420
– Sometimes you may have accidentally eaten something.

124
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:56,876
– It suddenly comes out. For example, he was allergic not only to food but perfumes.

125
00:13:57,411 --> 00:14:01,667
So if a lady with a perfume and touches him he got eczema.

126
00:14:02,923 --> 00:14:09,851
If your detergent is really strong and he scrubs on your detergent he gets eczema.

127
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:17,867
That’s not very bad because you can wash it and it goes away.

128
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:25,660
The problem is when it goes inside by food, through the inhaling of perfumes etc.

129
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:33,202
– The eczema came through many times when I was treating him.

130
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:38,243
– It was so bad as if he had third degree burns.

131
00:14:39,026 --> 00:14:41,226
–During your treatment, did the eczema come back?

132
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:46,683
– Yes. He had fevers, like when I first gave him Carcinosin and Tuberculinum.

133
00:14:48,923 --> 00:14:55,643
Not very often, every 3 months or so he had extreme fevers like 40 Celsius or more.

134
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:04,082
– With tonsillitis?<br/>– No. Mostly cough. Tonsillitis never came back.

135
00:15:06,763 --> 00:15:13,131
But in between the fever or after the fever he would often get eczema too.

136
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:22,274
And fevers were very long lasting. And often after the fever he would get better mentally.

137
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:29,523
He also developed infection in his mouth a few times,

138
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:36,747
so I gave him Mercury, Belladonna, Pulsatilla. He reacted very well with his fevers.

139
00:15:37,323 --> 00:15:42,611
He stops drinking, becomes extremely clingy to his mother.

140
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:56,131
– He is very attached to me, still. Pulsatilla state.<br/>– His father is very detached?

141
00:15:57,603 --> 00:16:06,284
– He is a Lycopodium but he is a very nice guy. They are very good parents.

142
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,435
– He is not detached, he likes his son but he just didn’t know at the beginning,

143
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:22,075
before Lycopodium how to play much. Now he is different.

144
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:39,738
– So he always had this cough as he would get in the acute, there is lots of mucus,

145
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:47,963
but last year, exactly the day before I came here, he started having severe dyspnea,

146
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:53,499
that’s the first time, a year ago. Ended up in the hospital.

147
00:16:57,723 --> 00:17:04,371
– They gave him inhalation?<br/>– Yes. Mentally he is so much better

148
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:10,635
every time after most of the remedies, he would get so much better.

149
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:20,419
– That’s the only one we give him some times. He had one dose that time of cortisone...

150
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:25,779
– Does it contain cortisone?<br/>– That one doesn’t. It’s the only one that doesn’t.

151
00:17:27,323 --> 00:17:30,387
But that time, when he ended up in the hospital last year,

152
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,322
they gave him one dose of cortisone to swallow, not only to inhale,

153
00:17:35,883 --> 00:17:43,171
plus cortisone liquid and it changed his behavior in 3 days but Helen gave him a remedy...

154
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:48,139
- After the cortisone did you notice any change in his behavior.

155
00:17:48,675 --> 00:17:55,875
– He was hyperactive, I couldn’t talk to him. Not anymore, though.

156
00:17:57,235 --> 00:18:02,531
– The most important thing that I see here is as he gets better and better mentally,

157
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:08,228
his asthma gets worse and the remedies start shifting too like,

158
00:18:08,843 --> 00:18:14,875
in the start Antimonium worked for probably almost a year, last year,

159
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:20,908
and though there is still a little bit of rattling always there left, it stopped working.

160
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:28,587
Then the picture started changing more often. In May he was an Arsenicum,

161
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,523
because he developed very burning discharge and some other symptoms,

162
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:36,707
for 3 weeks Arsenicum worked perfectly and then it stopped.

163
00:18:39,547 --> 00:18:44,715
Before that Phosphorus worked for over a year, probably,

164
00:18:45,418 --> 00:18:50,026
Phosphorus had a tremendous impact on him mentally and emotionally.

165
00:18:53,363 --> 00:18:59,531
But since last year, asthma episodes started getting worse

166
00:19:01,163 --> 00:19:08,243
and now they have to use inhalers every time there is an episode of asthma

167
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:16,091
because he cannot breathe and so I started using the remedies more often.

168
00:19:16,691 --> 00:19:21,347
Like right he is on Antimonium which worked by 3 weeks ago.

169
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:25,659
Now he is in Antimonium 200C and 1M once a day.

170
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:31,755
– Is he coughing?<br/>- No, but you can hear wheezing.

171
00:19:33,395 --> 00:19:36,307
Sometimes. Now, he is really good.

172
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:41,587
But what we noticed when he started getting remedies often

173
00:19:42,595 --> 00:19:48,083
like every day a certain amount, he got better. He is better mentally.

174
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:53,867
But the remedies are shifting from 2 weeks.

175
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:59,482
–The Antimonium did not stopped working last year, totally and now it works again.

176
00:20:02,731 --> 00:20:06,130
Also tried Pulsatilla last time and did not work at all.

177
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:11,060
And he doesn’t have high fevers anymore, fewer and milder,

178
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:20,195
he does not have these high fever episodes anymore. Last month he had 38,5 Celsius.

179
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:34,555
– I will see him. Will he easily respond to questions?

180
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:39,947
– He does may not appear, especially when he is anxious,

181
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:44,338
but he understands everything, he knows everything.

182
00:20:44,987 --> 00:20:50,484
They were in Volos, last week, they went one way from the hotel

183
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:57,307
to wherever they were going to take another route, he’d never been there before,

184
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:01,067
and he said no we go the exact same route. So he knows everything.

185
00:21:01,747 --> 00:21:05,467
He is extremely sensitive too. Not even to criticism.

186
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:11,002
He is very afraid that his mom is angry at him.

187
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:16,907
So, if she just raises her voice just like that, he is already so scared,

188
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:20,859
why are you angry with me, what’s going on, he wants to please her all the time.

189
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:28,411
– He says so or his eyes look so?<br/>– No, he says mom what’s wrong, are you ok.

190
00:21:28,763 --> 00:21:32,083
– He needs approval. At school when they say well work

191
00:21:32,691 --> 00:21:36,715
and they will tell mom he had a good day at school, this is a motivator.

192
00:21:37,107 --> 00:21:43,659
Big approval of mother all the time. Of both parents!

193
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:52,403
– Overboard you mean, really, all the time makes you tired saying “you are so good”?

194
00:21:53,387 --> 00:21:57,723
– Yes. You have to tell him all the time.

195
00:21:58,475 --> 00:22:05,316
– If his father is strict with him he doesn’t get frightened or upset. But if his mom is...

196
00:22:05,954 --> 00:22:21,371
- It’s worse.<br/>– The approval he needs from you only or from his teachers?

197
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:27,315
– From everybody but mom is the highest.

198
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:32,404
– However sometimes, he gets into periods he is very upset at her,

199
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:36,923
if she leaves for work without telling him, then she comes back,

200
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:40,715
then he goes into his room, closes the door, doesn’t want to talk to her

201
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:46,284
and she has to beg him.<br/>– I have to come and say I am home,

202
00:22:46,675 --> 00:22:50,482
I’m sorry, I had to go, I apologize.

203
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:54,851
- And another thing he does, punish them both if, for example,

204
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:57,675
they don’t let him swim for the entire day,

205
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:03,899
he is not happy with his parents, he soils his pants.

206
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,195
– As a punishment to us.<br/>– Yesterday we didn’t go swimming

207
00:23:12,578 --> 00:23:15,330
because it was so cold and he loves beach and water,

208
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:20,506
and he would punish us by soiling his pants, making his statement.

209
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:28,475
He holds a grudge against somebody, if you are not nice to him,

210
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:35,827
there was cousin who wasn’t nice to him, 9 months he wouldn’t see her,

211
00:23:36,268 --> 00:23:39,507
she is in the room, he behaves as if she doesn’t exist.

212
00:23:41,786 --> 00:23:54,291
Not anymore as extreme but holds a grudge a lot if somebody pushes him away

213
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:58,140
or pushes him down, offends him in any way.

214
00:23:58,691 --> 00:24:05,538
– And a few times he had very close friends, they left, he suffered so much.

215
00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:13,428
I gave him Ignatia a couple of times. He became very sad and depressed.

216
00:24:14,747 --> 00:24:19,867
– But that’s understandable because he doesn’t have many friends,

217
00:24:20,323 --> 00:24:26,827
people don’t connect easily to him and when he has people they have patience with him,

218
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:31,259
because he is very smart and he can give a lot but just cannot communicate as much.

219
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:39,619
He gets upset if people go away or they don’t pay attention to him.

220
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:51,122
He gets stuck on one food often and just eats one thing for a long time.

221
00:24:52,243 --> 00:24:59,387
– He wants to eat only one food?<br/>– Once he eats spicy salsa or spaghetti...

222
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:05,844
– Every day spaghetti?<br/>– Not every day but he is narrow-minded with the food,

223
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:12,700
he wants 3-4 things, he can maybe eat 50 but he wants now 5 things only.

224
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:16,611
So, I always have to push to new stuff...

225
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:22,739
- You have another child?<br/>– No.

226
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:26,675
– She is afraid to.<br/>– You had enough with the one.

227
00:25:27,074 --> 00:25:30,915
– It’s not enough, but I am afraid for him too, not for me, it’s our struggle but...

228
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:34,651
- It’s ok but why don’t you have another child?

229
00:25:35,187 --> 00:25:40,451
– She is afraid it’s going to be autistic again. That’s what I say, it won’t, right?

230
00:25:41,387 --> 00:25:46,067
– They told you that the other child may be [autistic]?

231
00:25:46,668 --> 00:25:49,924
– No, they didn’t tell me. I am just afraid.<br/>– There’s no such a chance...

232
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:55,995
- I am trying to persuade her.<br/>– Because you are healthy

233
00:25:57,467 --> 00:26:01,363
and your husband is healthy, the boy was born healthy.

234
00:26:03,635 --> 00:26:11,035
It was made sick with vaccination and antibiotics, that is very clear.

235
00:26:11,763 --> 00:26:24,106
Everyone who will be hammered by all these introduction of the chemicals into the body

236
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:29,211
will break down. So, there is no problem.

237
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:35,635
– Can I tell you about his eating?<br/>– His eating habits.

238
00:26:36,627 --> 00:26:43,379
– Yes. He doesn’t drink water at all, he drinks juice, orange juice.

239
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:52,123
– Aversion to water?<br/>–Yes. And he doesn’t crave for bread.

240
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:56,850
Here because he didn’t have much of his teeth he didn’t want to eat bread

241
00:26:57,306 --> 00:27:05,419
but at home he doesn’t want bread. Doesn’t like sweets.

242
00:27:07,811 --> 00:27:11,923
I didn’t like when I was a kid but he really doesn’t like sweets at all.

243
00:27:16,556 --> 00:27:22,594
- This is very unusual in Canada not to like sweets.

244
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:29,546
– His father likes sweets.<br/>– A lot!

245
00:27:34,803 --> 00:27:38,764
- Is there any other peculiarity about him?

246
00:27:39,603 --> 00:27:43,324
– He doesn’t like to try new food or new way it’s made.

247
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:51,651
Like tomatoes; he likes everything from tomatoes, like salsa, but not the fresh.

248
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:10,228
– His feet always sweat and smell sometimes.

249
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:18,275
– Sometimes they are offensive and often wet.

250
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,835
–I remember I gave him Silica at one point during one of the fevers.

251
00:28:28,428 --> 00:28:31,739
– Salt?<br/>– He likes salt.

252
00:28:34,307 --> 00:28:40,018
– That means he adds salt? Takes the salt and eats it?

253
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:47,787
– No, he doesn’t add on his own. If I put on the cucumbers lots of salt he likes and licks,

254
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,723
he likes salty but he doesn’t ask for things yet. Not everything.

255
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:55,667
– He eats meat?<br/>– Yes.

256
00:28:56,971 --> 00:29:02,388
– Sausages?<br/>– Not anymore. He used to like sausages, not anymore.

257
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:06,339
Now, not deli, just meat.

258
00:29:07,211 --> 00:29:11,771
– When the meat has some fat in it, he likes it?<br/>– I think he’s ok.

259
00:29:13,683 --> 00:29:23,611
– He is not picky on that one.<br/>– Likes cold food. I warm it up and he waits...

260
00:29:25,275 --> 00:29:28,570
- This is the reason why I have his Silica.

261
00:29:37,059 --> 00:29:42,442
– Your language is French or English?<br/>– Our language is Serbian

262
00:29:44,187 --> 00:29:52,179
but with his we are speaking English. First, we started speaking Serbian.

263
00:29:56,851 --> 00:30:03,507
– What do you say?<br/>– He is very anxious right now.

264
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:06,435
Sometimes he is scripting from the movies that he likes

265
00:30:06,922 --> 00:30:10,195
and picks up the sentences and repeating them.

266
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:21,811
Now, he knows he is being observed so he is anxious.

267
00:30:22,435 --> 00:30:25,842
– I think he is observing other people...

268
00:30:26,267 --> 00:30:29,915
- When it is safe at home he can communicate way more.

269
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:43,210
– He articulates properly?<br/>– He speaks and reads and writes

270
00:30:44,571 --> 00:30:48,099
and does presentation at school. He is just very nervous right now.

271
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,771
– Plays by himself. Autistic children cannot play by themselves.

272
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:09,243
He plays, he is creative and he uses his imagination. Plays with other kids too.

273
00:31:13,315 --> 00:31:17,362
– Eggs, he eats?<br/>– No. He is allergic to eggs.

274
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:24,819
– Allergic but do you think he likes them?<br/>– We tried but...

275
00:31:25,331 --> 00:31:32,203
- He refuses anything that contains allergens.

276
00:31:43,691 --> 00:32:00,147
– After Tuberculinum he started eating cheese. Dairy allergy was cured by Tuberculinum.

277
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,515
– Something peculiar; he likes opening holes.

278
00:32:07,995 --> 00:32:12,795
If he has a hole he puts things in it and makes it big...

279
00:32:15,906 --> 00:32:19,507
- He also touches his genitals often.

280
00:32:21,843 --> 00:32:24,475
– He is performing now.<br/>–Yes.

281
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:45,771
– He always likes people watching him.<br/>– He likes touching his genitals often.

282
00:32:47,403 --> 00:32:54,907
– That started 2 years ago, on and off, sometimes more sometimes less but it is still there.

283
00:32:57,341 --> 00:33:03,115
– Also he likes sensations on his skin of something soft like he will take a blanket

284
00:33:04,003 --> 00:33:14,731
and put it in his pants or shirt...<br/>-... He likes rough games.

285
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:20,444
– In the summer he likes to walk undressed?<br/>– No.

286
00:33:25,187 --> 00:33:28,083
– When he goes to the toilet, he goes by himself?

287
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:33,331
– Yes, he can go. Sometimes we go together, but yes he goes by himself more and more.

288
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:47,387
He still cannot wipe himself, yet.<br/>–Does he play with the stool?

289
00:33:47,867 --> 00:34:02,619
– No, he doesn’t play. I didn’t see him play. I don’t think he actually likes mud and paint.

290
00:34:03,283 --> 00:34:07,595
I like to paint and he doesn’t like to paint, get dirty...

291
00:34:10,763 --> 00:34:13,691
- He would ask her to wash his hands. He used to play a lot in the sand

292
00:34:15,074 --> 00:34:19,002
and then he would just wash his hands, he doesn’t like them dirty.

293
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:25,060
– The sensation of sand calms him down.

294
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:36,538
– Has he shown any aggressiveness towards some other children?

295
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:46,916
– Never. He likes having people to console him when crying. Big empathy.

296
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:58,859
– He likes to put fingers in his mouth.<br/>–Not all the time but occasionally.

297
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:14,242
– He loves music and dance, water, fishing, beach, sea, ocean.

298
00:35:14,668 --> 00:35:18,707
– You mean the sea water or swimming pool?<br/>– Anything...

299
00:35:29,058 --> 00:35:34,668
- You caught a fish?<br/>– I got a fish.

300
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:47,937
– Do you like fishing?<br/>– I like fishing.

301
00:35:49,658 --> 00:35:58,338
– We are going to go to the beach today.<br/>– Is he sleeping by himself?

302
00:35:59,536 --> 00:36:10,419
– He sleeps beside us.  He was sleeping in another room when he was 1 year old.

303
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,795
We put him in another room because he was breastfeeding all the night.

304
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:15,283
I couldn’t sleep at all...

305
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:20,251
- Was he grinding?<br/>– No, he was breastfeeding all the night.

306
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:27,082
And at year one we put him in a nursery in another room

307
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:32,955
and he was there for almost 1 year

308
00:36:34,242 --> 00:36:41,475
and then Helen told us that maybe he needs to be put back to our bed.

309
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:47,059
But he wasn’t breastfeeding so I didn’t matter anymore.

310
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:54,875
– Was he ever afraid of the dark? You had to leave a light on?

311
00:36:57,291 --> 00:37:03,043
– At that time I don’t know. Definitely, he didn’t like being alone in a room in the crib

312
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:11,820
but there always was a little light. It wasn’t completely dark.

313
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:19,634
– But now he is in the dark and when he wakes up he is totally ok.

314
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:23,587
– Are you now working yourself?<br/>– Part time.

315
00:37:24,043 --> 00:37:28,379
– What kind of work?<br/>– I am teaching at the college interior design.

316
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:37,746
Like inside architecture.<br/>– You studied that.

317
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:41,450
– And she is a painter too, she is an artist.

318
00:37:44,091 --> 00:37:49,723
When he wakes up in the morning and it’s dark now he is fine.

319
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:57,795
– No problem at all. He likes to garden with mama.

320
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:07,939
– Have ever given him a lemon to see how he reacts? If he eats the lemon, desires lemon.

321
00:38:08,187 --> 00:38:13,386
– We don’t know.<br/>– It’s hard testing new food on him

322
00:38:13,675 --> 00:38:18,620
because he doesn’t want to try anything.<br/>– Oranges?

323
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:25,372
– He loves oranges and orange juice, he drinks it like water.

324
00:38:26,539 --> 00:38:30,786
– Fresh orange juice?<br/>– Not we don’t make it, we buy it.

325
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:34,867
– He drinks fresh orange juice here, so he can drink it.

326
00:38:36,643 --> 00:38:42,099
– You don’t have fresh oranges in Canada?<br/>– He eats fresh oranges.

327
00:38:50,107 --> 00:38:55,451
– Other fruits he likes?<br/>– When he was 2 years old he ate everything.

328
00:38:58,131 --> 00:39:00,715
I was making everything for him because he was allergic.

329
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:10,163
So after that he started being picky, now he eats cucumbers a lot, me too,

330
00:39:10,763 --> 00:39:17,531
oranges and bananas, sometimes apple, but he can eat all the fruits,

331
00:39:18,451 --> 00:39:22,483
he was eating them before, he just doesn’t want to eat them now, watermelon.

332
00:39:22,915 --> 00:39:28,763
So watermelon, oranges and sometimes banana and apple.

333
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:36,754
– He is also very sensitive to sunlight. He used to be much more. Not so much now.

334
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:44,267
Yesterday he accidentally hit his leg against my shoe

335
00:39:46,171 --> 00:39:52,354
and he wanted to kiss my leg right away. I thought he was going to kiss my shoe

336
00:39:52,907 --> 00:39:55,490
and told him oh no don’t kiss my shoe.

337
00:39:55,978 --> 00:40:00,170
He went like that and he crawled under the bed because it was a little bit too loud

338
00:40:00,563 --> 00:40:04,779
and he thought I am angry at him. He is so sensitive.

339
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:15,082
- He got afraid of the sound?<br/>– He accidentally hit my leg with his leg just slightly

340
00:40:15,715 --> 00:40:20,347
but he thought that he hurt me. So he wanted to kiss my leg.

341
00:40:21,283 --> 00:40:23,995
And I saw that he was going to kiss my dirty shoe

342
00:40:25,075 --> 00:40:28,835
and said “no, don’t!” and he got scared of my reaction.

343
00:40:30,419 --> 00:40:37,779
Closed his ears and crawled under the bed. You cannot talk even a little bit loud to him.

344
00:40:38,714 --> 00:40:47,651
If he is upset or cries he is very upset.<br/>– He has sensitivity to sound.

345
00:40:48,451 --> 00:40:51,035
It was really bad at one point, last year actually,

346
00:40:51,707 --> 00:40:59,507
when you left for Greece and after Carcinosin...<br/>- He got much better after Carcinosin...

347
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:05,763
- He was much better after that. Now it’s  just high pitch noise sometimes...

348
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:08,291
- If it is deep sound he can handle it.

349
00:41:08,907 --> 00:41:13,139
– I don’t think he is scared I just think it hurts him, he has a sensitivity to it.

350
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,100
– Sensitivity to hearing.

351
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:21,452
– With autism it is common that they get overwhelmed with everything.

352
00:41:27,163 --> 00:41:31,956
– He wants harmony, that’s for sure, he doesn’t want any problems,

353
00:41:35,643 --> 00:41:39,787
anybody being hurt, angry or sad...

354
00:41:45,427 --> 00:41:49,650
- He doesn’t like his food to be changed but he loves to travel,

355
00:41:50,187 --> 00:41:54,091
he loves the change in a big, not in a small level.

356
00:41:54,635 --> 00:42:01,395
He needs his surroundings to keep him calm and out of anxiety.

357
00:42:01,938 --> 00:42:08,323
When we told him about Greece and about airplane, he was so excited,

358
00:42:08,835 --> 00:42:11,075
he wanted to go, he enjoyed the whole trip,

359
00:42:11,964 --> 00:42:15,395
but when we got to Athens he asked for his orange juice.

360
00:42:22,067 --> 00:42:26,795
He still wants his little meals to be prepared the way he likes it.

361
00:42:27,683 --> 00:42:30,610
But he likes to travel, see new places, new people,

362
00:42:31,915 --> 00:42:42,075
so he has this adventurous side in him. He likes running like auto-stimulation,

363
00:42:42,699 --> 00:42:47,931
in a room sometimes goes back and forth, not as much, before it was in circles.

364
00:42:50,515 --> 00:42:55,795
– As stimulation or to calm him down?<br/>– That one yes! To calm.

365
00:42:57,306 --> 00:43:00,691
– He is riding bicycle at home for the same thing.

366
00:43:01,467 --> 00:43:15,332
– But if he runs too much he starts getting some asthma symptoms. Ok, thank you!

367
00:43:24,611 --> 00:43:39,652
First of all I must say that the improvement from the original state is quite impressive

368
00:43:41,715 --> 00:43:48,363
and most probably it is due to 3 remedies out of those you gave;

369
00:43:52,203 --> 00:43:56,115
Carcinosin, Tuberculinum and Antimonium tartaricum.

370
00:44:04,723 --> 00:44:10,339
The question is what I see at this moment, what is the most probable picture.

371
00:44:10,971 --> 00:44:17,755
It is not a clear picture. There are several possibilities like Causticum,

372
00:44:18,963 --> 00:44:29,691
Hyoscyamus, Palladium also is a possibility, Asarum is a possibility

373
00:44:31,675 --> 00:44:33,828
but I don’t know how it will develop.

374
00:44:36,219 --> 00:44:41,043
In order to come down to the most probable remedy at the moment...

375
00:44:43,203 --> 00:44:54,324
which is an interesting feature of the boy from what we observed.

376
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:28,867
There are some strong symptoms of Causticum. But what impressed you?

377
00:45:31,699 --> 00:45:34,562
Looking at the child what impressed you?

378
00:45:39,275 --> 00:45:41,667
– I noticed that it was very restless

379
00:45:43,795 --> 00:45:47,371
and obviously he was anxious at the beginning when he came in.

380
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:50,531
He wanted to hide when he came into the room

381
00:45:51,131 --> 00:45:55,356
but then he started peeping out from behind to see what was going on

382
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:59,115
and after a while when he was more comfortable he was actually quite outgoing

383
00:45:59,547 --> 00:46:02,995
and was performing with his dinosaurs trying to spy you out,

384
00:46:03,883 --> 00:46:09,251
so he came over quite open then, as far as he can, of course, in his condition.

385
00:46:09,907 --> 00:46:14,835
He was communicative but always going back to a safe place of the mother

386
00:46:15,251 --> 00:46:23,628
or the father to hide. That’s from the external only.

387
00:46:24,419 --> 00:46:33,611
– It’s very interesting for me to see how much usually

388
00:46:33,979 --> 00:46:45,675
the mother almost never the father is identified with the children of that type.

389
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:57,627
The mother tries to understand, explain and need to explain why the boy is running

390
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:06,939
because a logical explanation that the boy will not do something beyond logic

391
00:47:08,707 --> 00:47:13,620
and they need that and they identify themselves so much.

392
00:47:24,827 --> 00:47:33,157
– Singing all the time, the boy. Nobody noticed that.

393
00:47:35,108 --> 00:47:48,700
During all the interview he was singing.<br/>– Is this correct Helen?

394
00:47:51,228 --> 00:47:59,404
– I think he was whimpering, he was a little scared,

395
00:48:00,524 --> 00:48:03,620
he was whimpering into his mother lap.<br/>– Was he singing or making noises?

396
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:11,173
– He actually moans a lot. When he is sick with asthma or anything,

397
00:48:11,708 --> 00:48:38,268
he moans, he moans in sleep...<br/>- Anyhow. Moaning.

398
00:48:59,093 --> 00:49:08,140
– If something happens like after a really really bad asthma episode his mother said

399
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:18,060
“ok, you are safe now” and he cried and cried for very long time.

400
00:49:26,476 --> 00:49:31,268
I think it was after a trip to the hospital, cause he couldn’t breathe at all,

401
00:49:31,684 --> 00:49:37,740
he gets very bad dyspnea. So she said you’re ok now, you’re safe now

402
00:49:39,132 --> 00:49:45,835
and he started crying and he does that from time to time if something happens.

403
00:49:51,236 --> 00:49:54,987
The child is in his own world, not communicating.

404
00:49:55,516 --> 00:49:57,924
He wasn’t affectionate when I first saw him.

405
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:03,003
He became like that later on and this is when I prescribed Phosphorus.

406
00:50:05,611 --> 00:50:08,556
When I saw his being affectionate, there was such a difference,

407
00:50:09,677 --> 00:50:16,908
I think it was one and a half year ago, I suddenly saw an affectionate child,

408
00:50:17,372 --> 00:50:22,164
he wasn’t like that at all at first, he was all in himself, like a little animal.

409
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,732
– There’s a big improvement, there is no question.

410
00:50:26,332 --> 00:50:30,988
– But seeing him being so affectionate I prescribed Phosphorus

411
00:50:31,396 --> 00:50:38,572
and then he was much better. And Phosphorus worked on his asthma for a long time

412
00:50:38,987 --> 00:50:55,388
and then stopped.
 – For me watching him, the most impressive is the playing antics,

413
00:50:55,844 --> 00:51:11,148
the grimaces, this is what in our repertories is seen as playing antics.

414
00:51:22,588 --> 00:51:29,868
Show me the remedies. Hyoscyamus is the only in capital, Belladonna...

415
00:51:37,548 --> 00:51:43,268
But this is a characteristic of Hyoscyamus, actually, quite strongly.

416
00:51:44,051 --> 00:51:50,276
What you saw is what we know Hyoscyamus is doing.

417
00:51:53,436 --> 00:52:09,515
And grimaces also, another expression. Playing antics means he is performing. Grimaces;

418
00:52:12,396 --> 00:52:34,060
Hyoscyamus is there as well. So Hyoscyamus seem to be the indicated remedy

419
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:40,883
especially because he says lately he is touching his genitalia.

420
00:52:41,468 --> 00:52:46,795
That was confirmed by the mother quite a lot.

421
00:52:47,348 --> 00:52:54,220
So if we see the symptoms covered by Hyoscyamus, handles his genitalia,

422
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:02,580
grimaces, aversion to water also is interesting that Hyoscyamus has aversion to water

423
00:53:05,396 --> 00:53:13,964
and grinding teeth during sleep, moaning, respiration rattling, sensitive to noise,

424
00:53:14,924 --> 00:53:24,468
asthmatic respiration and desire to hide also with the playing antics combined.

425
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:34,812
From this remedy missing the fact the has aversion to sweets so strong,

426
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:45,740
which we would like to have, the desire for oranges, the aggravation from eggs,

427
00:53:47,220 --> 00:54:07,525
offensive foot, discolored teeth, aversion to sweets that comes from the mother also,

428
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:14,798
it’s almost a hereditary thing, so it’s quite deep,

429
00:54:15,348 --> 00:54:20,340
maybe later on will go to Causticum with the affection

430
00:54:21,044 --> 00:54:23,972
and the sympathetic element will remain

431
00:54:24,964 --> 00:54:33,012
but I think Hyoscyamus is going to help further the development of the child.

432
00:54:36,868 --> 00:54:43,860
– What are we looking for after that?

433
00:54:44,452 --> 00:54:50,915
– After that the aversion to sweets will remain the sensitivity to others

434
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,444
and the sympathetic element will remain, most probably,

435
00:55:00,476 --> 00:55:09,644
and I don’t know what effect will have on his allergies.

436
00:55:10,324 --> 00:55:15,261
He has an allergic asthma, it is quite severe,

437
00:55:16,515 --> 00:55:25,035
I don’t know how much Hyoscyamus will control this or you will need the next remedy.

438
00:55:26,981 --> 00:55:33,107
Most probably will make the asthmatic condition better

439
00:55:33,684 --> 00:55:36,052
but he will need another remedy, definitely

440
00:55:36,564 --> 00:55:43,596
and most probably he will need Causticum as the next remedy.

441
00:55:45,452 --> 00:55:54,860
But at this moment where the shyness, you see no shyness at all, he can perform,

442
00:55:55,316 --> 00:55:58,924
he can do whatever he likes, he doesn’t care what you think,

443
00:55:59,436 --> 00:56:04,300
that kind with playing antics and the grimaces and all that

444
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:08,500
and the touching of the genitalia plus the other symptoms

445
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:18,685
brings us to the idea of Hyoscyamus and what is the potency?

446
00:56:21,828 --> 00:56:29,076
You see the child was damaged by vaccination and antibiotics,

447
00:56:29,548 --> 00:56:41,252
the combination actually, and that is why you were able to bring up such improvement.

448
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:54,012
Children who are born, straightaway, autistic are very difficult to improve,

449
00:56:55,628 --> 00:57:01,660
but if they are damaged through antibiotics or vaccination

450
00:57:02,092 --> 00:57:09,516
or the combination of them it is much easier to have some good effect.

451
00:57:10,124 --> 00:57:15,908
I believe this child can be quite improved

452
00:57:18,076 --> 00:57:23,867
and maybe at the age of 15 or 16 he will be almost normal.

453
00:57:25,372 --> 00:57:30,307
You didn’t see him when he wasn’t anxious, there is a tremendous difference,

454
00:57:31,036 --> 00:57:33,948
he was a little animal, now he is a human being.

455
00:57:35,572 --> 00:57:43,748
– This is amazing what Homeopathy can do in such cases where no other treatment,

456
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:49,957
as far as I know, can have such an effect.

457
00:57:54,572 --> 00:58:00,365
– I wanted to ask; he had a big desire for oranges like Medorrhinum...

458
00:58:00,964 --> 00:58:02,892
- Medorrhinum is also a possibility.

459
00:58:03,468 --> 00:58:08,492
– Also the mother said, when they didn’t allow him yesterday to go to the sea,

460
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:14,004
because it was cold, he punished them because he really wanted to go.

461
00:58:14,837 --> 00:58:19,932
– Also another thing is with Hyoscyamus, I forgot, this stool,

462
00:58:21,292 --> 00:58:27,556
to have stool is Hyoscyamus symptom.

463
00:58:37,587 --> 00:58:41,227
– But he didn’t say about stool if I understood well...

464
00:58:44,036 --> 00:58:47,083
- It’s an explanation of the mother, he wants to punish.

465
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:53,347
This is just nonsense that a normal child would punish by doing that.

466
00:58:53,827 --> 00:58:57,947
It has to be a symptom. There is another explanation,

467
00:58:58,524 --> 00:59:00,540
he wants to punish and he has stool.

468
00:59:01,115 --> 00:59:09,452
Of course the fact that he allows a 7 year-old to have stool is a symptom.

469
00:59:10,428 --> 00:59:16,643
– But did she say stool or soil? She said soil.

470
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:34,652
– It’s the same. I like the explanation. The mothers explain away everything;

471
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:38,916
he does this because of this, he does the other because of that.

472
00:59:39,812 --> 00:59:46,620
In fact, you have to see the whole picture. It’s a child that plays antics,

473
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:59,220
touches his genitalia, he cannot still control his stool etc. And then becomes a picture.

474
01:00:00,211 --> 01:00:03,748
– He does it when he is angry.<br/>– She thinks.

475
01:00:06,028 --> 01:00:10,188
He does it under certain psychological pressure. Whatever it might be.

476
01:00:14,964 --> 01:00:24,124
– Hyoscyamus has a strong fear of water.<br/>– No. He says aversion to water.

477
01:00:24,644 --> 01:00:28,524
Does not want to drink. Not fear.

478
01:00:29,028 --> 01:00:31,868
– He loves to play with water, that is what the mother had said,

479
01:00:32,445 --> 01:00:35,340
and Hyoscyamus has strong fear of water.

480
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:42,156
– Also a lot of other remedies have fear of water.

481
01:00:42,644 --> 01:00:50,604
The fact that a symptom is missing from a remedy does not mean anything.

482
01:00:51,451 --> 01:00:54,667
– It’s not missing, it’s the other way around. Someone who has fear

483
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:57,068
and somebody who loves water.

484
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:00,523
– Yes, but what is the problem? There’s no problem.

485
01:01:01,172 --> 01:01:05,012
That’s natural. Liking the water is natural.

486
01:01:06,524 --> 01:01:11,708
He, simply, does not have fear of water, he has aversion to water.

487
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:17,164
– There is also his sycotic background, he loves the sea...

488
01:01:17,564 --> 01:01:24,861
- Correct. Most probably later on he will need some Medorrhinum,

489
01:01:25,308 --> 01:01:30,332
I didn’t want to embarrass the couple asking whether the father...

490
01:01:31,677 --> 01:01:35,068
- I asked...<br/>- He denied?

491
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:43,004
– No, I don’t think. His father reacted to Lycopodium perfectly...

492
01:01:46,523 --> 01:01:50,251
I said his sycotic background is from his mother who is a Staphisagria,

493
01:01:51,371 --> 01:01:55,980
which treated her depression, her neck pains, her throat, everything.

494
01:01:56,532 --> 01:02:04,467
This might have contributed to his problems too because she was really an abused child.

495
01:02:05,052 --> 01:02:09,836
At the age of 13 she would clean the whole house and prepare food for her parents,

496
01:02:10,364 --> 01:02:13,316
her mother would come and say “why didn’t you clean this?”

497
01:02:13,724 --> 01:02:21,603
and “why didn’t you do that?”. At the time he got sick there was a very difficult conflict.

498
01:02:22,468 --> 01:02:32,452
– You belong to the feminine movement?<br/>– You said you will give him 30C?

499
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:50,678
– No. I did not. The potency you can start with is 200C.

500
01:02:51,356 --> 01:02:56,333
You give 200C every day for a few days, see the reaction

501
01:02:58,133 --> 01:03:01,116
and then if he is better and then worse

502
01:03:01,548 --> 01:03:05,638
then you may repeat as long as he keeps on playing the antics,

503
01:03:06,316 --> 01:03:12,540
doing all this kind of performance. When that keynote is gone,

504
01:03:13,084 --> 01:03:16,060
most probably you have to search for the next remedy

505
01:03:17,036 --> 01:03:31,868
which I think can be Causticum, Medorrhinum, Palladium or Asarum.

506
01:03:42,612 --> 01:03:49,476
Because he has high fever we can consider him to be curable.

507
01:03:52,036 --> 01:03:56,691
Just because his immune system has the possibility of developing high fever.

508
01:03:58,036 --> 01:04:05,292
Is curable. Level 5 or 6.

509
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:16,849
– If he had more vaccinations or more antibiotics...

510
01:04:17,329 --> 01:04:21,504
- The fact that cortisone interfered during this,

511
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,359
that was bad but you immediately saw the reaction,

512
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:34,850
you said the boy was chaotic immediately. Can go down to level 7 quite easily.

513
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:44,056
– Why do you consider Palladium?

514
01:04:46,401 --> 01:04:55,097
– Because he needs so much approval from others.

515
01:04:57,265 --> 01:05:07,512
That is a characteristic of Palladium and if that remains. Of course it is just an idea.

516
01:05:11,432 --> 01:05:14,056
The most probable are Causticum, Medorrhinum.

517
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:25,568
– For this little boy, he had his teeth at 4 months

518
01:05:26,952 --> 01:05:31,073
and he was talking at 9 months so he was really early.

519
01:05:34,952 --> 01:05:38,648
– He was talking quite early. 9 months.

520
01:05:43,872 --> 01:05:49,776
– Do you consider it is a factor of sensitivity...

521
01:05:56,761 --> 01:06:02,777
I mean he is early on the development, maybe also on the brain system,

522
01:06:03,824 --> 01:06:07,881
so maybe he can be touched much more than any other,

523
01:06:08,513 --> 01:06:12,841
because a lot of children have a lot of antibiotics

524
01:06:13,328 --> 01:06:15,968
and vaccinations and don’t have anything?

525
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,072
– What you are saying is correct. Most probably, has a relevance.

526
01:06:21,776 --> 01:06:28,544
That means because the organism was fast in developing.

527
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:37,752
He had certain extra sensitivities and because of the interference of the vaccination

528
01:06:38,392 --> 01:06:42,937
and the antibiotics brought the organism down.

529
01:06:50,112 --> 01:06:52,568
– As from experience can you please guide us

530
01:06:53,226 --> 01:07:08,240
in what cases we should move to X and C potencies?

531
01:07:08,633 --> 01:07:13,394
Some books suggest prescribing X potencies multiple times but so far,

532
01:07:14,057 --> 01:07:18,489
until now, I have not received any final standpoint from where we should go on X

533
01:07:19,024 --> 01:07:23,049
or we should go on C.

534
01:07:23,744 --> 01:07:30,432
– When you want to go low you may go to X. 12X, 8X, 9X.

535
01:07:35,064 --> 01:07:43,448
If you want to go very low you can go to quintecimal potencies

536
01:07:44,009 --> 01:07:53,553
which are very light. 1 to 50000. These are very light remedies

537
01:07:53,937 --> 01:08:00,672
and you can repeat them always. LM pontencies.

538
01:08:03,921 --> 01:08:11,489
But in my experience I don’t have to use LM potencies so...

539
01:08:15,569 --> 01:08:23,616
If I want to go low I go to 6X. Very low. 6X is the lowest.

540
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:27,847
– There are some questions.

541
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:33,688
You had not told which pharmacy you are using for your practice.

542
01:08:35,368 --> 01:08:40,416
The authenticity of the medicine or the genuinity is of big question of today.

543
01:08:41,312 --> 01:08:46,520
– I use all the kind of pharmacies. But if I see I give a remedy

544
01:08:47,193 --> 01:08:52,825
and does not work but I am sure the remedy is correct I use from another pharmacy

545
01:08:53,464 --> 01:08:58,712
and I throw away the previous one.

546
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,520
Many times with the pharmacies here we have a problem

547
01:09:06,993 --> 01:09:13,552
because I prescribe a remedy, no effect, higher potency, no effect

548
01:09:14,648 --> 01:09:20,888
and then goes to another pharmacy, takes the same potency and there is a big effect.

549
01:09:22,233 --> 01:09:26,753
So, I call the pharmacy and say to throw away your Rhus tox 200C.

550
01:09:27,408 --> 01:09:30,376
Make a new one. We have this problem.

551
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:36,384
– In that particular case I have one more question to finish with them.

552
01:09:37,353 --> 01:09:41,505
If we go to 1M then to 10M then to 50M and then to CM,

553
01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:46,881
still the same remedy is indicated then...?<br/>– MM.

554
01:09:48,489 --> 01:09:56,152
– We don’t get MM.<br/>– You prepare. Ask a pharmacy to.

555
01:09:58,914 --> 01:10:00,760
– My question is, I have a case of...

556
01:10:02,593 --> 01:10:07,840
- Actually in the old times they used to give these remedies MM, is not a joke,

557
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:19,473
but what they did they put a jet of water and then they had the potency

558
01:10:20,664 --> 01:10:26,120
and the jet of water went into washing out all the time

559
01:10:27,368 --> 01:10:33,873
and they had calculated that if they let this, for instance 3 hours,

560
01:10:36,888 --> 01:10:42,608
the water that goes in and out within 3 hours is 1.000.000 times.

561
01:10:47,648 --> 01:10:51,464
Still they said it worked, I don’t know...<br/>- So after CM...

562
01:10:52,352 --> 01:10:57,553
I have a case of motor neuron disease, it is a case of Causticum.

563
01:10:58,049 --> 01:11:02,769
I started with 200C, I raised the power and now is on CM.

564
01:11:03,817 --> 01:11:08,529
I give him CM whenever he has an exacerbation of the problems

565
01:11:09,008 --> 01:11:12,616
otherwise I stick on placebo. Now I am stuck up.

566
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:18,287
Indications are seen but I don’t have a rising potency. What is your opinion on that?

567
01:11:19,209 --> 01:11:26,272
– Take the CM and potentize it a few times. Just to make it a little bit stronger.

568
01:11:27,769 --> 01:11:32,401
And if that does not work then you can start all over going back to 12X

569
01:11:33,416 --> 01:11:36,920
and start with repeating it frequently.

570
01:11:39,096 --> 01:11:46,911
– In that case, Erik has taught us that higher potencies antidote low potencies

571
01:11:48,128 --> 01:11:54,320
so suppose a patient comes to us and we have given him CM potency

572
01:11:55,169 --> 01:12:00,417
and if he comes after 6 months or 1 year, should we start with CM or from any potency?

573
01:12:02,208 --> 01:12:06,423
– You must normally start with the last potency.

574
01:12:07,257 --> 01:12:10,801
– He has already taken CM but he comes after 1 year.

575
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:16,216
– You give again the last potency that was CM.

576
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:33,072
Also concerning his question this child had no fear of water

577
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:40,160
therefore you will not give Hyoscyamus, this is not correct

578
01:12:41,672 --> 01:12:50,097
because in 100 cases of Hyoscyamus perhaps the fear of water will be in 2.

579
01:12:51,296 --> 01:12:54,977
The rest 98 cases have no fear of water. 98% do not have fear of water.

580
01:13:12,241 --> 01:13:14,049
– Once again I had a doubt here.

581
01:13:15,226 --> 01:13:19,776
I see that you don’t take into consideration a symptom that was apparently very clear,

582
01:13:20,538 --> 01:13:23,248
ailments after antibiotics and ailments after vaccination

583
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,136
because Hyoscyamus doesn’t have any of these symptoms...

584
01:13:26,856 --> 01:13:31,536
- You speak a little bit fast for me. I did not take into consideration that...?

585
01:13:32,264 --> 01:13:39,073
– 2 symptoms that ailments from antibiotics and vaccination.

586
01:13:39,824 --> 01:13:44,505
Hyoscyamus doesn’t have them.<br/>– So what should I have given?

587
01:13:45,265 --> 01:13:48,336
– Stramonium because Stramonium has both of them.

588
01:13:51,392 --> 01:13:54,600
And Stramonium has all the rest; the antics, the grimaces...

589
01:13:55,248 --> 01:14:00,016
- Stramonium is much more aggressive.

590
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:15,521
He will hit, provoke, shout, see nightmares. It’s another picture.

591
01:14:18,832 --> 01:14:23,200
And fear of the dark is strong. Thank you!
